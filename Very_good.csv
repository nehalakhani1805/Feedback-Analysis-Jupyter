15,"Program demystifies the evolving world of CIOs in a typical global corporation.Coverage being introductory familiarizes participants nicely through some of the nuances & emerging trends.When I took the course participant numbers was fewer, so feedback was quite delayed. So one should plan to be patient to get their peer reviews.Based on peer reviews i sensed much variations in their expectations.Few sections are in French with Subtitles.Subtitle quality requires audit/review.",4
18,Videos that are presented in French could've been translated to English.,4
22,"Excellent... It is a representation of our day by day, thanks for sharing your vision, experience and advices...RegardsDaniel Damas",4
25,Great course information and content ! Very interesting ! Unfortunately there is a peer graded assignment which 3 classmates must grade. Although two of my classmates gave me all passing grades one classmate gave me all 0's and didn't really justify why; which made me have to re submit my assignment. Thankfully 3 other amazing classmates saw the quality of my work :),4
34,Course is comprehensive and detailed. But is a bit fast paced for people new to IT Finance,4
36,I think it should be a more engaged course with practical examples,4
42,"Important information on copy rights, patents, etc.",4
50,Great course. I enjoyed learning the material.,4
55,"Topics related to the economy or business are not something I am good at or enjoy reading about, this course helped me learn a bunch of useful things I would otherwise not have put effort into studying.",4
72,"Very good in-depth look at the potential applications for 3D printing. I especially liked the sections on development and education. This class gets you thinking about the potential ramifications of 3D printing and how it can change the economy, both locally and globally.",4
74,"Excellent course, could do with a little more visual references. Some of the talks are a bit tough to get through since you are watching 2 people. Content still very valuable.",4
93,good introduction!!!,4
95,Thanks for the course! It has opened me to the world of 3D printing - on when did it start and where it is now. :),4

124,Nice introduction to 3D for absolute beginners. Very interesting interviews entrepreneurs.,4
126,"It's mostly very basic stuff, but even then it introduced me to concepts I wasn't aware of.",4
129,"Good introductory course, just a little bit to short for my like.Gus",4
135,It provides not only a good overview about 3D Printing but stimulates people who attend it to look for more. Great course to start the journe,4
140,I like the course. Pretty concise and straight forward. Highly recommended.,4
152,"If you know little or nothing about additive, and it sounds interesting, this is a good place to start!",4
154,"A good course, please provide more practice quiz in depth.",4
161,A good Introduction to 3D printing.,4
181,"I am very glad to see courses like this one on Coursera. The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only £32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price. Although I am very happy to have access to the courses and I thank you for you effort!",4
185,"week 1 and 2 were kind of boring, but maybe necessary; weeks 3 and 4 were more interesting from a business point of view (i'm not so much interested in accounting as in business decisions).the virtual class of professor Bushee was quite funny :)",4
191,Providing what are the insight we need to look before investing in a company and how interpret the balance sheet and found the,4
194,Very good course but videos sometimes too long,4
201,"I have only taken one year of accounting in high school before, but the course was really easy to comprehend and engaging!",4
202,It's a very good course.,4
206,Very useful material to financial review of cash flow statements.,4
210,It was very well done and very informational. Thanks again professors for your dedication and time to educate society!,4
215,Very informative and interactive. I like the style of Professor Bushee's classroom teaching,4
218,Good overview on Financial Analytics!,4
220,Focus of first 3 week is more of an audit analytics material. Quiz material could have been more interactive. Overall OK course.,4
222,"Interesting course. Motivating instructors. Tests were sometimes a bit too much about semantics and too little about applying knowledge in a practical way (which the course intro hinted on). But it was good value, manageable next to job and private life and fun to do. You won't regret it.",4
223,This has been a challenging course for a person that doesn't have any accounting experience,4
226,"This is an excellent course, especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis. The concepts are clearly presented, with interesting details and supporting examples of their use. The inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating.",4
234,"The contrast of provided material is quite huge. In first for weeks all the analytics are explained and decisions are shown, in the last week only principles and overall concepts are introduced.",4
235,"I have many hours of undergraduate accounting and finance course work under my belt and this class gives you a tremendous overview of financial statement analysis. The only disadvantage is that the professor creates the workbooks for you and you only have to answer conceptual questions. While this would be great for some, I was hoping for some more hands on work to practice.",4
238,Very insightful topic! A good overview of the use of analytics in accounting!,4
244,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,4
247,"Rather robust material with strong focus on ""deceptive"" practice detection. A lot of ratio analyses, each with its own moniker which I found tedious. Informative and confirmed that I don't have the ""accountant gene"".",4
256,"The course and the instructor are great, but a missed some referenced material.",4
257,Thanks to the Professor Brian Bushee for the good explanations. I learned a lot. I find the module 4 so difficult for me. The Prof Christopher Ittner is speaking like CNN journalist and not easy for a non native US or English speaker like me to follow.,4
261,Very good course well presented especially as the topic can be fairly complex.,4
262,Week 4 was the best and the more appropiate for the specialization.,4
265,"There was a gap between the prerequisites mentioned on the course details and those stated by Prof. Bushee during the lectures. As such, I found this course a bit harder due to tons of new terminologies in accounting.",4
270,"Really useful course, concise and resourceful",4
277,Content very clear and explained by the professors.,4
278,Brain Bushee's videos are really impressive. Some areas are too technical for a beginner to understand. The rest of the material provide good understanding...,4
283,"Bushee was fantastic! Ittner was fine, but not as entertaining as Bushee.",4
285,"I loved the Accounting part of the course. It was quite hard for me (non-accounting person), however I really enjoyed the form of the lectures and the content itself (the earnings management + its revealing). Great materials Professor Bushee!",4
286,the Best cour and the Best sitetanks,4
287,"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos.",4
297,"This was a good course, no doubt about it. But i felt, that the subject needed more depth that the course framework allowed. I would have liked if it had a part 2 for this course for people who wanted to go little more hands-on in this subject.",4
300,Very well thought out. Many useful and applicable techniques provided that can be put to work immediately.,4
305,"really informative, original and useful!",4
306,This course provides a deeper insight into financial and nonfinancial performance on a pragmatic basis. However the course itself is really brief and the exercises cannot thoroughly provide reliable measure of the understanding of the lectures.,4
308,Definitely good course for those working in either accounting or analytics. It gave me new ideas on how to apply analytical methods. Interesting examples on how to identify number management and how analytics can help to set up non-financial metrics that drive financial outcomes.,4
309,Insightful,4
318,Good course if you are a beginner. Analytics is only 1 module (#3) and it is a good one.,4
329,"A little tough sometimes, but very instructive",4
330,"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?” I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going “yeah… that makes sense. I understand…” I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don’t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require “parroting” something said in the video.I’m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder’s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a “think about what this means” type question that is not necessarily “marked” but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they “go look at the spreadsheet”. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more “hand holding” and “direction” in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little “scary” for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I’m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes – this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 – Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 – talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an “increase means slower future recognition”. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 – no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford’s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures – some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students – particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students – perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don’t need to be long or complicated – just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to “play” with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of “messing” it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a “playground” sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another – so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios – one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don’t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live.",4
338,"The problems are really challenging, thank you! However, the instructor is not very active in the discussion forum, which is a pity when you really need help and get stucked in the problem set.",4
348,Offers a nice introduction to Ableton and its Usage. However it would have been lovely if this was a longer course.. Loved the way of instructions and the topics covered.,4
350,Really useful for beginners!!,4
353,"Good as a introduction, but there was only a few people on blend so it was hard to earn their votes, hope there will apear some intermediate or advanced courses.",4
359,"Great introduction to Ableton. If you love music, this can change the way you create sounds, melodies, rhythms,...",4
360,If only it was a week longer.,4
362,"A very good course for getting a quick and effective introduction to one of the coolest DAWs around! Barra has explained everything nicely, and in an easy to grasp manner. Go ahead if you're looking for digital music production even remotely!",4
363,Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!,4
368,"Excellent experience. Material, instructor and pace of the course were really good.",4
372,"Gives a soft view and precise information about what to do and how to do in Live.If you are looking for some input to start recording yourself or to start creating any kind of music, i strongly recommend this!",4
374,Great for getting me started. I feel much more confident in navigating my way around the Ableton workspace. Using blend has opened me up to some wonderful ideas and opportunities :),4
383,Very helpful in acquiring necessary knowledge about Live. I would recommend this course to several others like me interested to get their hands on Ableton.,4
387,Good course . A must take for beginners !,4
403,"While I did not have time to complete the final assignment I did find this course useful for creating a firmer understanding of Ableton Live. The peer review process is a great idea and something which I found to be both engaging and useful for networking with fellow artists.The content of the course I feel is probably useful to someone with no prior knowledge of DAWs, but this is not my first DAW. As such the course felt a little slow and the assignments a little unchallenging. Personally my peer review experience ranged from listening to fully fleshed out ideas to listening to uninspired loops of nonsense. I still feel as though I benefited from the process, however, and I gained an invaluable resource in Blend.I would love a next level - fleshing out some of the ideas touched on throughout the course, as well as exploring other ideas such as sidechaining.",4
407,it's a great introduction to ableton but nothing more,4
409,"Learned a lot. Got me started and using the program, and making music.",4
417,Really good resource for anyone wanting to learn the basics of a super flexible software.,4
437,Very good instructions of the teacher!,4
438,"Very good introduction to this software, teatcher is great and very easy to understand. I have learned a lot of good stuffs such as how to warp audio, convert audio to midi and so on... I was used to work on cubase and I have discovered the specifities and the advantages of Live.Moreover thanks to the assignment objectives I had to force myself to be creative and It was a great feelig.Thanks for this course :)",4
452,Good information!,4
454,"work motivational, very clear, well structured on a steady groove ... excellent!",4
457,Very interesting.,4
460,Great Introduction into the program....a quick look. I felt the tutorial in the program covered a lot and most of the info here can be found on youtube. Although you don't get a certificate for watching youtube,4
461,It is very nice for people are starting with abletobn program,4
465,"Great course, I just wanted it to be more thorough :) But for beginners like me, it really helped a lot! Thank you!",4
474,Great intro. Really gave me confidence with the DAW.,4
480,Great course. Got me started off with Ableton live. :),4
481,"It was fun. Have peer review is helpful. However, it was mainly one time comment. It would be great to start conversation and interaction among course takers.",4
487,"Thank you so much Jeff, iy was usefull course, i think it needs to extend the material and learning's period.Thank you so much!!!",4
489,i had a great knowledge !thanks for offering this course i don't have such course in india .,4
496,"The course was enjoyable for the most partand I increased my skill level. The videos, for the most part, were good. However, consider revising some of the one for Fusion to include demonstrations for the sweep, loft, and revolve tools in the Sculpt mode if they are to be included in assignments. These were not as intuitive as the others and required reliance on videos found on Autodesk as well as Youtube. Additionally, it would be helpful to slow the pace in illustrating ""how-to"" in the videos. There seemed to be steps omitted and I found it difficult at times to reconstruct all the steps. Finally, I noticed that staff/mentor help was not readily available for weeks, when participants posted queries in the forum.",4
504,"The bi-weekly assignments mixed with the bi-weekly lessons is a really great course structure. The audio on some of the videos interviews can be poor, and I wish some lectures, especially the last one were more in depth, but over all great course with a good pace.",4
509,I'm so glad Leiden University is working with Coursera. Such a great course!,4
516,A good refresher in abdominal anatomy. Though with some negatives. The accent was difficult to understand at first. Most of the course content is for beginners in undergraduate level. Yet it is still good.,4
534,"The course itself is 10 out of 10: overwhelmingly informative, presented in a totally engaging manner, lots and lots of visual aids. Fly in the ointment: teaching assistants (called mentors here) apparently have come from very different (including hierarchical) societies and learners are required to take the mentors' diversified background and attitude into consideration. Not vice versa.",4
537,"Nice course, a difficult one but very challengeable. Nice structure and easy to understand.I wanted to refresh my knowledge in anatomy and in such gained a whole lot more in return.Thanks to the Professors for their time and effort in making this MOOC.Very pleased.",4
538,"Not meant for learners new to the medical field. Despite the challenges, the material is very fascinating and anyone interested in anatomy will learn something. The course utilizes outside research. I might enjoy the whole course experience more if the design were not so technical. I do, however, appreciate the challenge and seriousness of the topic.",4
553,"A course offering very accessible, clear introduction to the concept of programming seen as a network of algorithms, supplanted with a myriad of real-life examples. It then introduced a comely intuitive software, developed by MIT - Scratch, which enables you to practically start creating animations and thus programming. Even though i'm not a fluent hispano-hablante, just the knowledge of English and some classical culture should make it possible for you to follow. At the same time, should that be too complicated, there should be subtitles/English language version to all the videos and of all other materials. Have NOT tried that though.",4
565,"Very interesting, well- explained, and practical course. Unfortunately you need the Excel 2013 professional to complete it and make the most of it.",4
578,"Very good overview and practical exercises to keep learners focus. Exercises can be very technical, get ready to spend more time on it.",4
581,"There are some excellent tools covered in this course. It is advanced level learning of Excel. There were a few glitches in the program. There was missing content at times. Overall, I was impressed with what the course covered.",4
596,"Good content but the Chinese translation is bad, which makes quiz quite obscure in meaning",4
600,The course is more about business competitive strategy and there are lots of live examples. Thumb up!,4
604,The research needs like six months,4
612,"Jefferson is a fascinating, controversial, brilliant, and hugely important figure - unquestionably a ""Founding Father"", if you will - in our nation's history. Professor Onuf brings to light the key aspects of Jefferson's thinking, work and accomplishments, prompting this course participant to want to further explore all that he did, the challenges, and especially the people, who he was up against, his relationship with Sally Hemings and how that influenced his views regarding slavery, and much more.",4
617,"My only recommendation would be to add more photos, maps, illustrations, etc to the lectures, instead of twenty minutes of the camera pointed at the professor. It would help keep the attention of the viewer, in my opinion.",4
618,The course is really nicely done. Also for non-americans it is interesting even though a lot of background knowledge might be missing. But you have to be aware it is really more focused on the ideas of Jefferson and less on all the discussions and fights he had with his fellow statesmen at that time. I would have wished to learn also more about those.,4
625,I loved the tour of the campus. It fit the material and made it seem more like a college setting than watching lectures on a screen in a class room all the time.,4
638,"A very enjoyable course, albeit with a few instances of leftward political leaning.",4
645,Useful orientation for a good American who more or less slept through all of his American hx courses in his callow youth. I have a much better sense of the important (if controversal) role Jefferson played in forming the values and structure of the US.,4
649,"Lots of well structured content, easy to follow and informative. You know it's the tip of a large iceberg, so it's a very good way to start and let you wanting for more.",4
662,It is excellent course in terms of the knowledge that I gain. However the multiple choice questions are a little bit default to understand. It is look like that you are examining our English skill :),4
669,"Great examples used in course videos. The Course Notes might be a worked on a bit more in terms of models and examples, but they are quite extensive and an invaluable resource. Teaching staff is quick to respond to forum questions, which is great!",4
672,great course,4
675,I think some estimation methods are not really realistic,4
679,"My least favorite part of the course, but it was still put together well. Content just isn't as interesting as the rest of the specialization. Felt a bit too ""Project Manager' instead of the Product Manager.",4
680,It's very usefull course,4
683,"Some part of learning material not concern to agile planning, for exampe absolutly not mentioned kanban planing.",4
687,Good Course.,4
690,"I am Krishna Kant Kumar, working as a software quality analyst.Through this course, I learnt, how to estimate an iteration or doing an estimation of project.",4
692,"Not the best, but if you are a newbie in management field you can find valuable information inside.",4
694,Room for improvement:-Case studies-More Assignment,4
697,"Very useful to know different tecniques for software project/productplanning. Although some of those tecniques are (in my opinion) notvery relevant in an Agile environment (like work breakdown structures,pert or gant charts) the course is good to learn how to use those toolsand also to ask ourselves whether or not they are actually relevant or useful if we follow the Agile approach.",4
700,"Really nice course. I was expecting a little more depth, but I really enjoyed the approach they took and their assignments.",4
704,"This course has the minimal information than its brother courses, you may need to add more details focus on the planning more and give more assignment if applicable.",4
707,Nice course. Decent content and always well-structured lectures. The peer assignments could have been better though.,4
728,I like Prof. Tobias Kretschmer way to communicate the course and explain the contents in practical and well organized way. The course is very useful for my work.,4
732,Course and examples are generally good. In rare instances the quiz has answers it labells 'correct' which I think could be debated.,4
733,Interesting course. Valuable insights into network effects.,4
740,Very interesting and full of real case study.,4
747,nice one to get into the strategy of any kind of the competionsyou could pass it even if you didn't go through the Part1anyhow it will be more then useful to understand the basis,4
758,"content was not as interesting as in the first course, but still good overall. Questions were also less analytical challenging as the first course. But I still enjoyed the course as the professor was explaining the subject clearly and the videos were compact and enjoyable.",4
760,Fascinating material. Thanks again!,4
763,"Varied and well-explained that held my interest throughout. My only criticism is the English in some of the written quizzes, especially in the final exam, needs reviewing by native speaker as some of the answers are ambiguous when they do not properly explain the context of the situation.",4
768,"One suggestion would be lest multiple option answers, but the course was challenging enough to learn valuable information.",4
769,Very useful course and extremely well presented. Would recommend it.,4
771,"Very good course, but it is not ""advanced strategy"".",4
772,Very informative and I learned a lot,4
776,"It was a great course, however some of the quiz answers are debatable",4
778,"Material was tough, some of the questions weren't easy to understand / process. But overall a great class.",4
780,"While the course was overall well developed, there are certain language challenges to overcome especially with understanding the wording of quizzes. I got a number of questions wrong simply because I could not understand the phrasing, and lack of explanations on quizzes makes for a lot of difficulty to evaluate progress. And I get the reason for not including answer explanations, at the same time I'm literally comparing answers to the module transcripts and could not possibly infer multiple choice answers based off how the topic was explained. I would suggest more definitive questions and reduce multiple choice questions or at least define the question in a more narrow, specified manner to minimize confusion. I'm taking this course for fun, I have an MBA and love strategy, so the topics are not new by any means, but if I can't understand what you're trying to say I would imagine non-business backgrounds would find the questions very difficult.",4
785,very Insightful,4
798,You need to check out his course.,4
821,well explained informative course,4
828,"This was a great class for review of what I learned years ago. I only wish I could have participated in the assignments w/o purchasing the class, as I have been able to in all of my other classes. But, I loved the class and would recommend it.",4
829,"Fantastic! Good work that the teacher can compact the course section to less than 10-minute videos each week, and it is clear. Easy to grasp . . . help a lot for my initial study! MLA format and work cited page are great too . . . thanks!",4
830,It was really useful. From now on I will start applying everything I've learn in my collage tasks.,4
846,It would be extremely useful to me as it is teaching me techniques to write advanced-level essays.,4
848,great course thnx,4
850,I have learnt so much for doing this course. I have recommended the course to friends and families.,4
859,"At this point, I think that the course is good, however there should be more reviews. Three reviews of people who is also learning is not enough, in my opinion. I have received some comments like 'some sentences are not good'. Which tells me absolutely nothing. I think people should be encouraged to exemplify what they mean ,to take the sentences that they believe that are wrong, and extend why.For the rest, the course is very good.",4
862,nice things to do and good examples.,4
869,Very good Course!! Thank You.,4
875,"The course presented a lot of interesting, fascinating information. I especially liked the first female lecturer. However, there were some problems with downloading the course slide presentations and questions were never answered in the forum discussion groups. In addition, the second lecturer, although very interesting, often did not talk about the material that was presented on exams. I also think integrating a lot more animation to describe different processes would be effective so that students can visualise the content.",4
882,Fascinating course but a little too much math for my taste.,4
886,"I find this to be a very nice and stimulating course. The teachers are enthusiastic and entertaining. The course material (slides, quizzes, captions) needs to be polished, but the general organization of the course is logical, clear, and systematic. The course presents an experimentalist's view of the subject, which I find very good considering that much related Coursera material is quite theoretical. There are plenty of historical notes and introductions of general neurobiology research viewpoints (don't miss the excellent bonus material interviews!). In particular, I enjoyed the ""cherry picking"" metaphor. Some students have had problems with the instructors' accent, but perhaps because English is not my first language, this has not been a problem for me at all. I'm looking forward to part two of the course!",4
900,"The applications were too time consuming. Please consider adding a tool that makes graphing easier. The course itself was very good and engaging and without us knowing it, would teach core fundamentals of computing through the coding exercises.",4
904,"Project is interesting, bu the video lecture is kind of repetitive and does not cover much",4
906,"I found the material of this course to be very enlightening, it's not too difficult if you have the appropriate background. However, it will take a decent amount of time to fully complete. As part of the specialization, all of the skills I've learned were consolidated and put to an interesting use with this class.",4
907,"The lectures will not get you near the understanding you'll need to complete the assignments. though the resources will.The application is great, and hard so you'll actually have to understand the material.You have been warned, this course is very different to the other courses in the specialization!",4
915,seemed kind of dumb at first but got better,4
917,"Helpful on a knowing america through other country's eye. However, I think the course would be more interesting if if could include more discussion about how all those country and US view each other now instead of focusing much of its content on history.",4

936,"I am much excited to partake in this course and it has really improved my worth. i strongly recommend it everyone. A very big THANK YOU to the coursera team for such an initiative and also to the Agriculture faculty of university of western of western Australia for such a partnership. i am very grateful, looking forward to work with you. BRAVO!!!",4
940,Pretty Good Course,4
943,The course was amazing i learned a lot of new things . if someone responding to these review i want to add something . In final quiz i did not find proper result . Which question i marked wrong and which one right . So please solve this problem.,4
946,As someone with only (UK) high school level maths I just about managed to follow this. I am still confused by logarithms. I guess I should go and read the maths for computer science resource.,4
949,Sometimes too much mathematics.,4
960,I would really love to take this course as I m currently a computer science and thanks for granting me this course Yuhuuuuu!,4
963,Great course but audio and video are terribly out of sync.,4
981,"I would recommend this course to anyone who has some experience with coding, but has not taken an algorithm course. I particularly like this course because it is more ""math-heavy"" than some of the other courses. After taking this course, you might not be able to solve all Leetcode problems (so probably will not help with your interviews directly), but from an intellectual point of view, I think the instructor does a good job explaining why people care about algorithms and how to analyze a class of algorithms rigorously.",4
991,Great,4
994,The unique value of taking the course: read and think through the material with guidance and completing its assignments is the efficiency by saving all the search cost would I collect on my own the good and succinct presentation of the knowledge and exercises with solutions (at least correctness checks.) The entire detail of an algorithm is hard to keep afresh in memory and one needs to refresh it from time to time. It is very cost-effective to take a course like this to accelerate the refresh.,4
1003,"Great course to improve your skills on Algorithms, Space and Time complexities",4
1005,Needs hands-on experience with high-school probability to help crack the exams,4
1027,Good learning,4
1029,The material was a little light and far fewer video quiz questions to test our understanding of the material. I also tried to test myself on BFS and DFS by doing online quizzes like geeksforgeeks - bombed really hard.,4
1040,Many of the weeks' videos were out of order.,4
1044,if u do those math it will definitely help u to be advance,4
1045,It's a very nice course if you're doing some refreshing of college chemistry.,4
1048,Great!,4
1049,"Excellent course, very challenging, instructors take the time to explain the work very well.My only suggestion would be that week four be split into two more manageable sections, as it was quite large and there were many different topics covered. As aqueous equilibria are not my strong suit, it was a lot to take in",4
1054,"It is a good course for beginners, but it is too slow for advanced learners who want to refresh their knowledge.",4
1058,This whole program is so knowledge-giving...thanks to Coursera and University of Kentucky.😊,4
1059,"There were some mistakes and weird glitches, but overall solid overview of second-half chem",4
1066,"Needs some means of feedback. Several times I felt sure that a question was wrong, but there's nothing to be done about it. Additionally, it would be nice if, after completing (and passing) a test, you could see what you did wrong and how the answer should have been determined.",4
1067,very easy to follow,4
1071,"amazing course. all topics about chemistry are here, very good quizes. a good course",4
1093,Very Interesting course that covers a huge range of topics over a long period of time. A very well informed lecturer who can speak about the subject matter in a clear and concise manner.,4
1096,Some great material and I learned a lot. I did in fact complete the course but chose not to submit written material. Sometimes the lecturer was perhaps a little dry.,4
1101,"I found this a really interesting course to complete. The lectures are easily digestible and help to provide context for various readings that you complete along the way. I would have liked an introductory lecture that gave an overview of some of the major themes of the course more clearly (I felt a bit at sea throughout the first topic having never studied this before. I didn't know what to pay attention to). But once we were underway, I had no trouble working out the flow of events. I really enjoyed this- thank you!",4
1104,"A good starting point to learn more about the ""Ancient Greeks""",4
1105,"Great course, but the quizzes are not quite there yet. They focus too much on minor details and the questions are sometimes awkwardly phrased.",4
1152,well presented and thought provoking,4
1154,"I enjoyed this course. It was very interesting, the teacher explained each topic well. A very informative journey through the Ancient Greece.",4
1157,"It is a good course and the instructor is very knowledgeable on the subject. It´s just that, after a while studying about wars it seems that there´s no ending or purpose. It is a very good analisys though.",4
1161,"The course was very interesting. My recommendation would be to also include videos as resources, where possible. For example, I found videos of 'Medea' and 'Antigone' on Youtube and watched them and loved them! Since it's theater, it's completely different seeing the play than just reading it.",4
1167,"Excellent survey course. Only wish there was more information given on details of daily life, also wish the course was a bit longer. Had issues with verifying the quizes.",4
1171,"The lecturer was quite knowledgeable, but I think he needs to work on his presentation a bit. Particularly at the start of the course he didn't quite know what he was trying to say",4
1172,"I had forgotten how much reading there is! I didn't have a lot of time, but I enjoyed the lectures a lot and it revisited my interest in history and ancient civilizations. I think I learned more from this than the Ancient Civ class I took many years ago in college! Most enjoyable!",4
1182,It is a great educational experience that opened the door to the ancient Greek history.,4
1183,"I knew nothing about ancient Greece before. Excellent course. Thanks. David Pearsall, Greenville NC",4
1194,A really great course!!,4
1202,Good introduction to the period - balances political history with wider social and cultural topics. Well supported by original source material. Maybe the expectations of weekly reading are set a little high for many students. I personally found the sections on early Greece particularly interesting as I was least familiar with that era.,4
1203,"Excellent course! Very knowledgeable professor, yet easy and pleasant to follow. The programme is well structured and the content approached with some depth (considering the introductory nature of the course). I would have loved to see, though, a focus more on philosophy (pre- and post- socratic), visual arts and the Hellenistic period, as it is most of the times neglected, even in today's historical accounts. Hope to see more courses on Classical Studies soon at Coursera.",4
1204,The course is ok. But we need really less lectures and more application based courses.,4
1221,"Overall good course, programming tasks are fun!However, some of the video lectures are only of average quality. Accent of the TA is sometimes confusing (fyi I'm not a native speaker).",4
1224,Fairly good course. I wish the edge cases for some of the programming assignments had some more discussions. Needed some sifting through the forums while stuck.,4
1227,"Lectures were very clear and assignments were really helpful for me to understand gist of each algorithms. This course, however, only covers 1. Basic concepts of Graph, 2. Shortest Path, and 3. Minimum Spanning Tree which doesn’t seem to be rich.With more diverse and interesting problems associated with Graph included, I strongly believe that students will get much from this course.Thank you",4
1228,Was very informative course. Learned a lot stuff.,4
1229,Good sessions and assignments.,4
1230,Very interesting and well presented course. I particularly wanted to learn more on graphs and this helped me get not only a basic but a more advanced understanding.,4
1237,Great,4
1239,Very good explanations,4
1240,"The course was awesome but the ""Algorithms on Graphs"" course the month after has some ridiculous extras. Since the course hereafter will have additions related to how Graphs are used in the real world today - I have to give this current course 4 stars. I can't comment on the next course but I think talking about how graphs are used in RL is immeasurable. Good Luck. I do hope you give this course a chance if you're interested in Graphs or looking for a refresher like I was.",4
1241,"Good course , nice assignments , a little bit more of explanation might be helpful for beginners",4
1243,Instructors in Algorithms on Graphs manage to provide a placid -yet complete- course.,4
1245,"Great course, would have been better, if authors added more assignments and material to study as graphs have so many applications. Anyways, I do believe that motivated learners will go ahead and find more challenges for themselves. As always, thanks to all the instructors, keep up the good work!",4
1247,Interesting course to start learning about graphs,4
1250,I really enjoyed the course.,4
1258,"The course contents and assignments are clear and well-structured. Compared to the algorithms & data structures courses, this one was a lot easier (for me anyway). I would have liked additional content on, for instance, (Markovian) grids/fields, but perhaps this will be covered in the 'advanced algorithms' course.",4
1266,"This course is easier than the previous three, but will help in gaining basic to intermediate knowledge on graphs.",4
1281,Good Course material and Assignment.,4
1326,Very completely!,4
1330,"The course is very difficult, but the quality is excellent. Due to the stringent grading of the program submissions, I believe more help should offered for each assignment.",4
1352,"The course was really good in giving real time examples of the algorithms and its usability in the real world ,the course should also have offered few more assignment covering each topic in the assignments using every component of the course!",4
1371,"The assignments are extremely challenging and enjoyable. The videos can get a bit confusing, but overall a great course.",4
1382,"Overall, very good course. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star course is the lack of resources around comparing completed programming assignments.",4
1384,Great and challenging course to learn data structures and algorithms.,4
1414,"I have never studied such a good algorithms class starting from very basics. The best thing which I like most was Java implementations of every piece of algorithms of basic data structures. All videos lectures have detailed explanation of topics. Just a suggestion that - time and space complexity explanations could have been in more detailed so as to understand easily by a novice. Although, the programming quiz questions were difficult, they require every chunk of knowledge you have just studied. Also, adding interview questions related to chapter with hints after your trial and MCQs after every small lectures were charm to the course. I am sincerely looking forward to enroll in other courdses as well. Thank you so much Coursera team, Robert and Kevin.",4
1421,The course is good refresher as well as advanced to meet enterprise needs.,4
1427,Great course!Cons: too java oriented.,4
1431,"Great course. Sedgewick has good educational skills. The course also contains good examples and interesting assignments. I struggled a bit with the first assignments, but then I liked the last 2 better. Looking forward to part 2.",4
1438,It would be very helpful to let us see the forums of previous sessions.,4
1455,"This course is very helpful with me. It helps me review a lot of materials about algorithms I've learn from my university. Thanks professors and other members for a great course. If you want to solid your knowledge, don't hesitate to take this course, it's total worth it.",4
1464,I think it is a good course. I have known more about time complexity of algorithms and some applications of different kinds of the algorithms. I have spent more time then I though for this course.,4
1492,The course lost a lot without tests. Theory is great. Assignments are pain in the azz - too much is assumed here and there. You must resubmit like a dozen of times to figure out what is wrong.,4
1508,Excellent lectures with very structured yet interesting contents. The homeworks are very useful!,4
1523,"I really liked the videos and the lecture slides. I think the assignments were really good as well, but had the feeling sometimes small but important informations were missing or not placed well enough. I read the description for the 8puzzle half a dozen times, but that this is not actually solving the task in the optimal amount of moves but rather in some arbitrary amount of moves (we just output the optimal moves) somehow escaped my attention.",4
1525,This course is helpful,4
1562,"A good introduction, though I would have appreciated more readings or suggestions on where to look into the topics in more depth (particularly the Financial Services Metrics). It was disorienting to not use actual data sets in the final peer assessment.",4
1563,Provides a good overview of metrics and how to think about them. A good starting point,4
1569,it's better to explain more about financial glossaries in the video.,4
1577,very useful!,4
1582,Course is good for getting started with Data Analytics!,4
1585,Peer Reviewers seem too keen to take marks off or dont bother reading the assignment,4
1586,"It was new and good expirience for me. However, I expect to see more alculations and practical tasks. To calculate smthn, to make some conclusion from it. To analize results.",4
1590,Good course however the test have difficult questions since are open to different points of views or judgements so it is hard to get the right answer.,4
1592,i really enjoyed the course and learn a lot of things about business analysis and how to distinguish between different metrics and which of them can we use for immediate changing in business processes,4
1596,good to understand a broad concept of business metrics,4
1599,Good basic intro to business metrics,4
1600,"I love Dr. Egger's way of teaching, however the videos could use some updates. There are errors that were pointed out 5 years ago on the message board, but they have still not been corrected.",4
1605,"Course was great. Not sure I agree with all the peer grading I received, but the instruction was excellent.",4
1606,Interesting course but I would have appreciated some exercises with more data to analyse (maybe more practical case). I don't understand the correlation with Aribnb ...,4
1616,Good to get an understanding of a Business Analyst / Business Data Analyst / Data Scientist job.Financial concepts brought seem a bit out of place in the context of this specific course though.,4
1622,"Overall I feel the course provided sufficient material to understand the concepts and terminology. For some of the data analysis terms, I feel that practice problems and step by step guides should be provided.",4
1627,Very informative and a good start to continue on to the next courses,4
1632,The course is good way to start the Data Analytics. Everyone before venturing into Data Analytics with lot off doubts should attend this course and it will clear the doubts.The teaching team should provide some downloadable slides of the text shown during the presentations. Coursera can recommend for slides similar to slides in Entrepreneurship Course provided by Wharton Online.,4
1643,I find this course very useful and helpful. Its is a core to data analysis using Excel and I learned a lot.,4
1644,Very interesting. Especially the content on Business Metrics,4
1655,"Very easy to follow, but the pacing is a bit uneven. Overall a good introduction !",4
1656,"Good professors but you will not learn a lot, since it is more or less an introduction for the other courses of the specialization. Good if is not used as standalone.",4
1661,"Good overall. Some of the material was very basic, but it does give a good foundation to build on. I recommend it.",4
1664,"I think you should have the basic English skill to join this course.From this course,you can learn how to distinguish different business metrics.",4
1670,Teachers are excellent!,4
1679,really informative for technical engineers who want to know more about business! you can count on that!,4
1682,Coursework enhanced my knowledge and armed me with information to speak with confident about the job I am pursuing next in my career.,4
1683,Very interesting and explained common language. Looking forward for the next modules.,4
1685,Excellent course to get an insight of Data related tasks and profession,4
1691,It would have been better if the final assignment was assessed by the instructor too.,4
1698,"Informative course, the final case study could be beefed up a bit to make the quantitative material stick better.",4
1699,Excellent and informative,4
1704,I liked the course. I give 4 stars because as I noticed some of the course content wasn't updated even if almost one year ago people issued that some calculations given by professor are wrong.,4
1708,"The metrics introduce is broad, but it helps you with the idea of how businesses function in this modern world. We were also introduced to theoretical business for which an attention to business metrics is important. It is good for those who have a technical quantitative background, but no business background.",4
1722,Valuable and useful info for aspiring business analysts.,4
1723,Good Course! Nice coverage of the basics!,4
1725,Needs more comprehensive assignments and challenging quizzes. Other than that the material is excellent!,4
1727,"A great start to the subject matter. Clear, concise and easily relates to actual business principles.",4
1734,"Introductory course, perhaps a little too light on the details.",4
1736,"as a science student, I think the course is easy to learn. It provides a lot of concepts which I can only remember a little though I understand their meanings.",4
1737,"I learned new concepts to use not only in business, but in my life. I would suggest the availability of the material that is presented.",4
1740,"Lectures were a bit slow-paced, but the information was great.",4
1750,This course was useful as a general overview. I plan to take other courses for more specific techniques.,4
1751,Good Course,4
1756,This is a great course.,4
1758,Maybe a little more of application activities but overall very well!,4
1771,I like the course. It was interesting the way that introduces the basic for doing analysis in a real company.,4
1773,This course provides an good introduction to common business metric. It provides real world and fiction example that help solidify the concepts being introduced. The lectures are easy to follow and quizzes help reinforce what student learn. The concept that I've learn will definitely help advance my career in business analysis.,4
1774,"It was a great introductory course, and a comprehensive overview of different business metrics.",4
1781,Very good intro class to Business analytics. Wish there are more content to learn.,4
1782,Great course for getting your feet wet.,4
1783,a very good course.i would like more questions in each video though - and more problems to solve too.but great overall,4
1787,Good thought provoking class. A good foundation class to take before taking the MySQL or Tableau or Excel stats classes.,4
1795,Very informative,4
1801,"This is a great course. Very helpful in understanding Business Metrics better and at helping create a foundation in big business and data. Some of the videos around the specific numbers were a little vague on what was an example and what was an actual metric. All things considered, still well worth the time, money and effort! :)",4
1808,Eggar was brilliant.but week 4 i could not understand,4
1822,"Wonderful course for a starter. However, there were (although very few) points where a more structured approach could have helped making things easier to understand.But a very helpful course to understand the landscape of the Business Metrics and their application to real-life business problems.",4
1827,Clear to have basic knowledge to know more about data analyst.,4
1831,"This was a basic, yet interesting introduction into the field of business intelligence.",4
1833,Great class and great intro to get excited about data analysis! Very good class for people with any background.,4
1839,I think the pace is a little,4
1841,Very interesting course,4
1852,"Really useful introduction, helps to orientate oneself on the path to data analysis work",4
1853,I really enjoy this course. It has a lot of information!,4
1854,This course gave us more basic concept of business metrics and many of them are brand new for me. Professor introduce this course very clearly.,4
1856,This course has been an awesome revision for me about my Management Information Systems concepts.,4
1865,Great course!,4
1868,"Good introductory material. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because most of the material was not directly relevant to my business world (pharmaceutical development).Anyone working in a financial environment or in web-based marketing will learn from the business metric examples given.The investment portfolio metrics are useful for anyone who has personal investments, even if you are not involved in finance professionally.",4
1874,"Good introductory course, but some kinks need to be worked out particularly in regards to the lectures and assignments.",4
1875,"This is a great course, and a wonderful introduction to the world of Business Metrics. I did wish it was more data driven (in that I really thought there would be more Excel work), but I'm glad that I took this course because despite the lack of data in numbers it has set me up to do well in the rest of this specialization.",4
1881,A good intro course for those who are starting out.,4
1882,"Good introduction to business metrics, but not enough practical stuff.",4
1886,Good. Looking forward to next.,4
1888,Overall good introduction to business concepts.,4
1892,"This is a very quick and effective class to teach you the language and concepts within business metrics. You will also hear descriptions of data-related jobs - what are the roles and differences in skills applied - and these jobs are fairly universal across all industries. The portion of this course that could be better is when the professor throws a bunch of math into the content. It is basically irrelevant to this course, and in and of itself it is so rushed and introduced so out of context that it is very confusing.",4
1899,Great course!,4
1902,"This course being an introductory to Specialization, doesn't stand so good alone. What I really liked were the real-world examples of companies. As introductory course it was fine, but id didn't contain practical assignments (as following in Specialization courses do). The structure of the course was ok.",4
1905,Very useful knowledge and relevant examples are provided.,4
1911,Good overview into Business Metrics. Had some focus on stock/financial terms which weren't applicable to what I was interested in. Overall a valuable course however.,4
1912,"It looks nice this training, but there are plenty of questions on every quiz. I think 15 is too much. I've taken other courses and there are no more than 10 questions on each one.I enjoy the last assignment.",4
1918,It is too easy,4
1925,"Great to learn about cash flow, both positive and negative. Makes sense, a course for the real world.",4
1926,"Good course that introduces the idea of metrics. If you already work with metrics, you will not learn much new.",4
1930,A good introduction course on business metrics. Especially great for those without business background.,4
1932,Awesome course,4
1933,The course covers the basics with an in depth analysis to introduce you to the world of business metrics. Learned a lot.,4
1934,Good course to build an overall understanding of metrics used by businesses but could have been better if assignments were more case-based but then again thats just my opinion and if the slides were provided at the end of each lecture--just saves time.,4
1937,This course starts off slow and gradually goes very deep into business metrics which provides a valuable view-point on the topic.,4
1940,"Generally, a very great introduction for business analytic. However, for non-business major or new to business world, this course can be overwhelming because of its frequent usage of business terms. I will recommend you to take basic accounting and basic operation class before taking this one.",4
1941,Good course for beginners. the final assignment should have been with a detailed data set.,4
1947,very useful course for me as a data analyst in a website company,4
1948,Very good course,4
1949,I enjoyed this course because it opened up a nice array of new concepts in a clear and understandable way. It's always refreshing to find a well-planned course on Coursera.This is not to say that the course couldn't use a little bit of tweaking though. There are still a few areas where things could be made clearer.,4
1955,It's a fine course that doesn't go into too much depth. A goof overview of business metrics.,4
1958,"It's a great course that gives a brief business perspective to the metrics involved in companies. However, content in this module can be heavier to give it a more in depth view by the introduction of more terminologies and examples.",4
1959,Helpful course with strong instruction but limited practical application versus other similar courses focused on more topical application of specific tools and functions.,4
1961,"Great presentation, interesting material. Both fun and enlightening, but there were a few rough edges that could be polished up. Strongly recommend!",4
1962,Excellent course.You can learn about different metrics that the companies use to improve its performance.,4
1973,"Great course with lots of practical information regarding finding work actually using the material.More actual case studies and less portfolio theory would have made the course a 5/5. Too much portfolio theory for a class on business analytics: Most people taking this class will never desire to work or have the opportunity to work for an investment bank, so I found it a bit irrelevant.",4
1974,Very good instructor,4
1978,Good introduction to a data science driven approach and understanding a data science driven career.,4
1984,It's fairly dense with sensible things to know and do.,4
1985,"Not so technical in these business metrics, a bit unclear in defining all of these metrics. However, give me a very good mindset about how data analyst looks like and what skills do the position require. I am really looking forward to the rest of courses from this combo.",4
1986,"Lots of great technical information that was accessible for me, a chemist, to understand and integrate. My main complaint is with the presentation. The speaker was so slow that I had to run all videos at 150% speed to keep from falling asleep. Though, since that was possible, it turns out his slow speaking wasn't really an inconvenience.",4
1988,"For a beginner like me, this course was a good introduction. I really liked the interviews of the earlier students who are now working in different role in different companies. That gave me a good insight about the working world in this field.",4
1994,Great course. The instructor is very knowledgeable and gives lots of examples of real companies using metrics. There are some good assignments to practice using the things taught in the course. Seems like a good specialization too.,4
1996,"This entry-level course provides a general understanding of data related job positions, companies, and industries. The difficulty of the course is suitable for those new to the data world.",4
1999,"Very interesting introduction to the business intelligence, totally recommended.",4
2022,Good mix between theory and practice.,4
2024,Good beginning course.,4
2027,Great course! But they don't provide weekly summary of content despite number of people have already requested this :)Would definitely suggest!,4
2029,"Pretty good course. Good professional speaker. But to common ,aterials.",4
2037,"What this course can improve is it should adopt the habit of thinking more instead of writing. Because in the week 5, the quiz is much more difficult than all the exercises we have done in previous weeks. And we don't have the guide step by step like previous weeks. I do know we have a week 5 quiz guide. However, when you write queries, sometimes, you do think your logic is right and query is right, why can't I get the same answer with the choices?And when I finish the quiz and look back to the answer, I even can't find the logic difference between answers and mine but the reality is I can't get the correct result. There is only one diff I have found in one specific question, that is, I didn't use the same format to define one constraint. But I do think my way is also fine and I also get an answer I think is totally correct from the logic.So I do suggest the answers should not be single sometimes, you should consider some specific formats or situation when students write their own queries. Don't give simple answer, give the reason why you are correct.",4
2038,The relational schema for the dognition database should have been provided.,4
2047,"great but a little bit complex, you could better learn the book first",4
2048,"Very difficult, but you will learn how to use SQL!",4
2055,The Teradata part is quite challenging and I think it would be better if there are more hints. I like the SQL part more.,4
2060,Good introduction,4
2072,To the point and with excellent real world data to train on your assignments,4
2073,"The notes are perfect! But I do think that the content might be a little bit easy.. Good course for beginners, but if you are looking for more challenges, this might not be the best choice for you.",4
2088,Practical knowledge.,4
2089,Very Challenging course work!!,4
2091,"Really good Course if you have the time to follow all the workshops and assignments, because they take quite a lot of time to complete, so allocate some extra time so you can learn properly, the good thing is that at the end you will have a solid understanding of SQL, Query’s and how to mine data for answers. Highly recommended for SQL starters.",4
2092,I really enjoyed the course and found it very useful. I can write a basic query now !! and I got a bit more understanding of how to work with databases. My only recommendation for the mentors is to work on more samples of queries using Teradata and add the answers to the week assignments. I'm still wondering a few answers and not sure if the output of my queries was the expected.,4
2100,"Very useful and well-designed course. Jana is an effective instructor with a great sense of humor. Her course material is easy at first and gradually gets harder, which is suited for students with no SQL background but eager to learn. But this course does require a lot of your time and dedication ---- Plan 5 hours every week and sometimes even more (week 4 and 5). It took me 2 rounds of enrollment to earn the certificate. All in all, I would recommend this course to people interested in data analytics, who want to update their knowledge beyond excel and have the time and the drive.",4
2104,"It's very practical but hard at the same time. I like the teaching style. What's makes me little uncomfortable is that the teradata system guidance is kind of obscure. However, the Jupiter guidance is really yummy. Hope to learn more sql applications in the future.",4
2117,nice course for me to better understand how to master the sql,4
2122,Very complete and up to the point! Lots of useful resources!,4
2125,Week 3 is unrealistically difficult,4
2126,Title's a bit confusing. The course isn't exactly about managing BigData.,4
2128,The actual amount of time required per week to complete the course was well over the 3-5 hours/week advertised on the course homepage. It was a very time intensive activity each week- especially the last 2 weeks.,4
2130,Difficult but very useful course,4
2137,"The course should be longer, prepare yourself you are going to need a lot of time, unless you have previous experience from SQL. It'll take maybe even more than one session. But it is worth it, because it covers all skills you need for working with SQL. If you really need to learn SQL, there is no better option.",4
2139,"Course was well conducted and explained, however, the final test was quite long and challenging.",4
2147,"Great content, good practice using real-world business data.",4
2153,work with real industry data is so much fun!,4
2161,"It's pretty good for entry-level SQL learners. However, to further improve, much time is required. Also, exercises provided are sometimes really weird.",4
2173,Challenging course going from very basic to quite complex SQL queries. Definitely recommended. The only downside are the repetitive technical issues.,4
2180,Switching between platforms was confusing but overall the course was good value for money,4
2187,"Great course, a little hard",4
2190,"Very good, detailed course, I can recommend! Before that I knew nothing about SQL, now I have moved to higher level of analyst. Sometimes the instructions are not 100% clear, but it is minor problem.",4
2192,Derived attribute was never conveyed in the videos. So kindly add up the concept of derived attribute.,4
2196,"Its a very good class to learn to use SQL in a systematic manner, even if you had used SQL or are completely new. The two Databases ( Terradata and Dognition) gave a lot of valuable practice.",4
2198,great course.. only thing is answers to teradata exercises were not provided. So student cannot know whether he is writing correct sql statements,4
2207,"Good material but heavy work-load, especially since we are learning two new skills -SQL syntax and Data analysis. Request instructors/TA's to guide students more in the forums. Analysis like computing avg daily revenue should be explained better as I spent too much time figuring it out and the forum answers were way off. However, this being an online class I was very impressed with the detailed worksheets in MYSQL.",4
2210,The course is very thorough but i woul have loved it if you had a way for instructors to better reach out to classmates rather than leave things to chance and everyone is confused for month. But either way the experience is priceless. Would recommend it to anyone,4
2211,I love the practice exercises!,4
2214,"I have a theoretical background in relational algebra and SQL. This course did a great job of actually applying that theory in practice in the form of business situations. By using real life data, it also accurately presented raw data as not perfectly organized or ""clean"". Filtering with subqueries, IN, WHERE, and OUTER JOIN statements are absolutely crucial in cleaning data in real life situations; this course did an excellent job of demonstrating that importance.I have 2 interrelated critiques however: The usage of 2 different platforms (MySQL for the exercises and Teradata for the quizzes) was very confusing given their distinct syntaxes. I think it would have been more powerful to have the exercises and quizzes on the same platform. Furthermore, the Teradata platform was oftentimes overwhelmed by the number of users and frequently crashed. Going forward I would recommend either ensuring that the servers can handle the amount of user-load, or switching over to the MySQL platform entirely.",4
2218,"The course instruction is very good. If the Teradata database is improved, the course will deserve 5 star.",4
2219,Nice web pages to test the knowledge.,4
2223,"This course should be divided in 2 o be longer for two main reasons:1) Weeks are way too long to cover all the material, plus the research you need to do outside the platform. The time required end up being too much.2) The course is not deep enough - There's just too much topic to cover, and because of time constrains there are a lot of holes in your education at the end.For this two reason is better con get 2 courses about this topic. That way you can go deeper in to the SQL explanation, and can get at thee same time a better understanding of each topic, instead of getting a lot of thing to cope in just one week.",4
2252,Objective. Very good material and good practices to help you better build a bibliography for research purpose. Sometimes the multiple answers quiz can be tricky.,4
2253,"Not too comprehensive, but an overall good course.",4
2254,I have important knowledge and skill finding information through this couse.,4
2258,Very informative and interesting. I find that the exercises did not contribute enough to understanding the material.,4
2259,I learned a lot!,4
2262,Very useful and handy tips.,4
2269,"Very interesting course, better done when in an academic context and with an ongoing project to carry out the exercices for. If you don't have access to a university library, you will be very limited, but the course presents some alternatives for us professionals who are still interested in researching and documenting our work with a more scientific approach.",4
2271,"Like they say in the course for bachelor students, this is very helpful. I study history, so I always and up with millions of sources. Not only have I learned how to search intelligently, I have also learned to manage my results and papers carefully.",4
2272,"Apart for some slightly confusing breaks in the sentences for some speakers, it was very good and relevant information.",4
2290,"Very well-presented course with excellent illustrations. Gives a good overview on addiction with pharmacology, with good links to further reading. I found the title slightly misleading though, as the course presented very little information on brain physiology except for the dopamine receptors.",4
2291,"Great course, wish if it was focused more on the glutamate and dopamine roles in addiction and relapse. thank you",4
2295,"This course was particularly helpful and explanatory to someone like me, who has little knowledge of the processes of substances in the human brain and the effects of drugs in general. I enjoyed almost every lecture's content and the way the whole course was structured. However, I do think that the way the lectures were delivered was a bit dry and that more perspectives on the drug addiction issue could have been presented.",4
2296,Interesting overview. The teacher is clear and competent. Lacks opinion of differents sources,4
2298,Its all you would want from the course. Informative and efficient.,4
2299,A great overview of relevant material and a well negotiated outline of how harm reduction can positively impact longterm drug abuse.,4
2302,Very informative,4
2303,"The information was great. My only complaint would be how dry the lectures were, and I do not meant the content, I meant the delivery.",4
2310,"The instructor for this class is pretty boring, but do really like the course itself",4
2311,this is very informative coures,4
2322,"Very comprehensive but easy to follow. I only regret the ""pro animal testing"" proselytism here and there.",4
2331,This was very informative and right on the mark with how society feels and what is available in the lines of treatment/help.Thank you.,4
2340,"While providing some knowledge about drugs and drug-addiction, I would have preferred a more in-depth guide into the inner workings of the brain related to drugs. Nevertheless it served as a good introduction to addiction.",4
2352,I learned a lot in this course. I thought the rat experiments were very interesting and revealing.,4
2366,"The content was great, the presentation was a bit dry, but I feel I got a lot out of this course.",4
2370,Very informative.,4
2374,Well-structured and very factual. Also many resources made available for further learning.,4
2379,Fairly interesting course. I learned quite a bit I can say from taking this class. Some of the content seemed irrelevant. But overall a great course!,4
2381,"This is an excellent way of to understand,",4
2384,This is a very good introductory course on the various aspects of addiction. I wish they would introduce a second part with more comprehensive information.,4
2389,"This is a very interesting course. Some of the material is pretty difficult, but it is presented in a clear manner. I learned a lot from the professor.",4
2390,A great and informative course. Very clear and interesting! I would have appreciated a bit more if it discussed more tips to help prevent/deal-with drug abuse or addiction. Thank you for the course!,4
2401,A great insight into the addicted brain and what can be done about it all. A great broad introduction into drug addiction and the brain.,4
2403,"So far, very educational , would appreciate if the videos would be little more discriptive",4
2411,"Real interesting and useful course, but since it's not my major, though sometimes hard for me to understand some concept. Still quite good! Nice teacher!",4
2419,"Briefly introduce some concepts of the drug use and some in neuroscience, a good introduction course.",4
2423,"Great course. It could have been a little more dense with technical information, but it was excellent for a broad overview of the topic.",4
2425,"Very good introduction to why people become addicts. Key points are learnt are our brains are wired to be addicted, addiction is a brain disease and needs to be seen and treated as such and that coffee which i drink everyday is a drug!",4
2430,Well designed course. I have a couple of close family members who are addicts...pills and gambling. I highly recommend this class. The professor is excellent and I've benefited from his lectures.,4
2431,"I enjoyed the material and flow of topics presented. I did have some trouble getting a few of the videos to load in the module on Neurotransmission (week 5), which was unfortunate. Very interesting, thanks!",4
2434,"It was informative but felt that the instructor was somehow too confident of his position, though he did give lip service to other positions. I am not sure why this bothered me, since I agree with the importance of being compassionate and the misguidedness of a punitive stance towards addiction. And in fact, it has nothing to do with the course. I would also have enjoyed seeing more and/or more detailed case studies.",4
2435,"The course gives a very comprehensive overview of what drugs are and how it affects the brain, as well as practical advice for person and government. It addresses the issue in a scientific but simple way, that makes people really understand what we are dealing with, especially with the concept of comorbidity.",4
2437,Very clear and organized materials.,4
2444,This is a useful basic refresher course for anyone who works or volunteers in the substance abuse field. I wanted to know the latest brain research and get an update on the various drug categories.,4
2445,"Very comprehensive on all aspects on drug addiction, though a bit too difficult for those without any medical or biological background knowledge. More animations / diagrams for illustration would make the course better.",4
2446,Great course into the physiological aspects of addiction and brain psychology. Please have expand the course.,4
2448,Great contribution to healthy humanity.,4
2456,"Not bad, some tests are too difficult, specially to understand the right questions. Materials are good but some details make the expereince not so good. However, overall is a good course!",4
2458,I am a working professional in the field of data analytics where in Tableau is one of the application we use it on a daily basis. My motive for taking this course is to learn some more innovative techniques that are used by professionals in tableau but the fact was there is nothing new for me to learn here in terms of techniques. I would say this course suits best for a beginner but not for someone who already has some lineage with tableau.Pros:1. Hourglass model is one of the things I liked the most.2. Final project submission is really challenging and which help me to learn lot of new things.Cons:1. Weekly tests are very lengthy2. Every once can get 100% not a big deal by trial and error3. Most of the questions in the weekly course are very subjective and cannot have a single correct answer. We had to retake the test again and again to get 100% due to subjective questionsHowever this course has definitely changed my way of looking into data and the way we decipher it. I am looking forward to continue and take more coursers to be a the part of this esteemed analytics community.,4
2462,The more complex functions in Tableau could be explained better.,4
2463,Good Course for Introductory Tableau Visualization.,4
2464,Really interesting even if a little complex at times,4
2467,It is a good start for us to learn Tableau. But I think the video instruction is not so clear.,4
2468,"excellent content and final assessment giving a nice funny challenge, well done to the team!",4
2469,I just think that there could be more assistance with respect to the practice exercises :) otherwise the lectures by Jana were absolutely terrific :),4
2483,good course for tableau and effective communication.,4
2487,"Very steep learning curve switching from the videos and lectures to the final assignment. But enjoyed the challenge. Relevant links to learn specific topics on the tool would have been helpful. Interesting data sets to work with (Salary & Dognition) and challenging problem statement. If the intention is to learn Tableau as a tool then I would not recommend this course. Part of my expectation was this also, hence only 4 stars.",4
2489,"Both Challenging & rewarding, taught me basics of Tableau, viz and comms.",4
2500,Very comprehensive and clear content delivery. Usable and helpful learning tools,4
2503,"awesome tool, teaches you how to think like a data scientist",4
2509,A great course from Business Analytics point of view.,4
2524,Loved the Tableau section and the instructor is a good communicator. It'd be great to have a whole course about this BI Software,4
2530,it was an awesome course. One of the best I attended from Coursera.,4
2532,"Prof. Jana S. Borg is the simply the best! Every lecture material (videos/exercises/final project) is carefully crafted to optimize student's learning experience. She's made the learning fun and that's not easy to do!Now, let's talk about the reason why I didn't give this course a full 5-star rating.... It's the students! As you might already know, this class requires us to put together a 5-minute screencast video that will demonstrate our understanding in 1) Tableau, 2) Business Analytics and 3) Presentation skills. Unfortunately, most of the students only care about the first one while blatantly ignoring the other two. And that makes the grading process a pain in the..errr.... you know what!Another important reminder. Be sure to submit the final project days before the deadline. Otherwise, you might be at risk of not getting graded by 3 other students! On the forum, a student claimed that she was forced to join this session because she couldn't get 3 peers to grade her project TWO SESSIONS ago! The horror!",4
2534,Great course with strong material on how to create an excellent presentation and use Tableau.,4
2545,I have loved this course and the videos have been amazing. This course has been fantastic for getting a foundation in understanding data analysis and the use of Tableau!,4
2548,Amazing course with good start up,4
2550,"Excellent course, well presented.Very useful tips which I will probably return to later in my career.",4
2562,"Excellent class to learn to visualize data using Tableau, I feel a lot more confident about using Tableau and its features. The final exam project was excellent. On a constructive note-- I wish they had a couple more videos or Pdf guides to format a presentation.Well done Instructors",4
2568,"Its a good course, but I feel too much details in week 3 course content.",4
2572,Awesome course!,4
2575,Good course and very nice demonstrations on Tableau.,4
2576,Interesting,4
2584,Great for those starting out getting their hands wet with a FREE copy of Tableau!,4
2597,"The material is very interesting with well-made videos. Great course to get an introduction to Tableau.The downside for me was that some videos were rushed with as they had too much content, and quizzes could be much better, I found the questions not really up-to-par with the course content.",4
2602,Quite helpful,4
2614,Great training using a terrific dataset. Learned some best practices and frameworks too.,4
2616,"The video presentation at the end isn't what I would expect/want from an online course. I stopped short of the final project, but the course was otherwise useful.",4
2619,Useful Tableau tips and visualization recommendations.Instructor videos are accelerated most of the time so the speech sounds unnatural and sometimes difficult to understand.,4
2625,"Interesting, loved the teacher.",4
2628,"Good brush on Tableau. Great that the course included a 6 mo license to Tableau Desktop!However while more complex topics where touched, they were rushed also. An extra week or two at the more advanced stuff would've been beneficial. Some of the quizzes also were a bit silly and focusing on minor things.",4
2629,Exciting course.,4
2630,Nice course if anyone wants to learn Tableau. Practise exercises & Quizes are relevant. It would be nice if solutions are provided for both the practise excersies and the quizes.,4
2634,"Great course, very comprehensive but in the other hand challenging to keep you engaged in learning and self discover about your ""real"" data samples.I'll continue with the specialization, thanks Duke University.",4
2635,Good class but could do with a bit more explanation of the Tableau features,4
2636,"Not perfect, but overall pretty good. No support from instructor or teaching assistants in the course forums.",4
2637,"Really liked the course. Very well designed and carried away. The only thing I wasn't too happy was the final project as the data was not easy to understand. As a beginner when we have to focus more on Tableau related features, I ended up spending more time understanding the data which didn't really help me. Otherwise, it was a good course. Surely, it put me on a fast track for Tableau.",4
2638,Good syllabus and challenging assignments with real data. Great lecturer too.,4
2649,Good videos well presented. Good intro into data viz and Tableau,4
2653,"Great course. Very informative. I am a marine biologist, but we also struggle with the same type of problems in properly presenting our data in effective and engaging ways. This course is very helpful in giving ideas on how to do this better. I also introduced me to new software in Tableau which is pretty impressive. But it is yet another program to try and learn which may be a deterrent to some.",4
2654,"Professor is engaging and I am happy there are so many video lectures, it is really nice and you feel you are genuinely progressing. Quizzes are very tough though and this course requires a lot of dedication and some frequent repeats of the videos to understand the material.",4
2670,"I learnt a lot in this class. It was always something I wanted to accomplish. I learnt that you must have a lot of memory and hard drive space on your PC to run the emulator I also think that the new studio, Android Studio is better than Eclipse. I loved the forums because they solved most of the problems I had. I would like the instructors and mentors to answer questions in a timely manner.",4
2676,"It's a great course, really is, but there are some weeks (4th week for instance) with a overwhelming amount of content, leaving few hours to study and even fewer to conclude the exercises.",4
2679,"I thought the Week 4 was a bit rushed and some content could be divided into two or more videos. The Labs were really stressful (yet valuable) and the pacing changed dramatically comparing to the three first weeks. Other than that, everything was great and I learned a lot. Cheers Mr. Porter!",4
2685,"Thank you very much , good course , i have learnt alot of things about Android programming .",4
2693,"This course was great for me. I was looking for a refresher course since I had some Android experience, but due to different career path I have not used in about 4 years. It was good for me.",4
2700,Moves too fast though,4
2712,Nice chose to start an Android developing life.The class is very logical and interesting. All the home works are easy to finish .I am in the part 2 of this class now.,4
2716,"I give 4 stars instead 5 just because the last assignments, building an app from scratch, should me more interesting and useful",4
2725,"Great Course..! but include 10000 of practice test like 3 hour of practice tests because test will prepare you and define what is your level , include job focus to get job , include hackathons .Include direct apply to companies from this course.",4
2741,"Fairly well presented in that different points of view on the questions were put forward. I found it interesting and informative to learn how better to choose compare and charities.Unfortunately there seems to be a dominate premise. That is this course insists one must give up the maximum part of ones income to 'charities' who will do the job to help others for you. In this I disagree and have not changed fundamentally in my perception.Having said that, one does come away with more motivation to think about and to act more altruistically as the occasions present themselves.",4
2742,Well balanced approach that invites multiple perspectives on ultruism. I would have liked to see the objections against ultruism of Ayn Rand being addressed in the course but I suppose it is difficult to give a course that addresses all aspects of a given topic. But Ayn Rand had a definite contradictory viewpoint and it would have enhanced the class tremendously if it had been considered.,4
2743,"Solid course, makes the case both for acting ethically, and for rationally choosing how to carry out those ethical activities. I had heard most of these arguments before and was already convinced by them; but if you are looking to figure out how to do more good with your life, it is a good course.",4
2746,"Audited the course. Found the information quite useful. In the quest to live an evermore ethical life, Peter Singer helps to bring light to the issues at hand in an accessible way.",4
2757,"Very strong concept, to take and employ in your day to day life. I found it very vital for not for profit work.However, substantial philosophy knowledge is needed in order to really absorb and follow the argument.",4
2764,Very well done. I would have liked it if there were more assignments.,4
2767,"The course was well done and included interesting guest speakers. However, I was not keen on the format and am not likely to sign up again for a course where the Coursera student is like a voyeur into the professor's actual classroom. In this case, we were privy to his lectures at Princeton and the camera frequently panned the classroom full of students. I have taken many Coursera classes and all were directed at the Coursera student specifically. I appreciated that. And I also appreciated Peter Singer allowing us into his Princeton classroom. I realize what an incredible opportunity he gave us through Coursera. So, thanks.",4
2777,"It would have been nice to use more complex data analysis, as used in the second course of this specialization, in order to build the final model.",4
2787,This is an excellent course - really stimulating and very practical as well. Jeremy Ghez teaching is highly engaging and thought provoking. Well worth the time and effort!,4
2788,"All in all this was a very good course. Jeremy Ghez is a bright and inspiring teacher. The content of the course was extremely interesting and well put together. I would have certainly enjoyed to have some sections of the course expanded, which was my only disappointment. I thought the assignments were very well handled and def",4
2790,COMPREHENSIVE AND EXCELLENT,4
2791,Good course with basic concepts.,4
2805,This course is fitted for me who want to self study.,4
2806,A good introduction,4
2825,"Very easy course and the set up was very predictable, although I do wish that the course switched up some things so that it wasn't the same every week. Nice overview of ADHD. I liked how the power points were included so that I could go back and look at them and all of the extra reading materials are very helpful.",4
2829,Quite informative.,4
2830,Nicely organized to learn the practical implications and the intervention techniques,4
2833,The course is very helpful. It has cleared many misconceptions I had. I am sure the Daily Report Card and Behaviour contract will prove to be very helpful. I just wish some more classroom behaviour management strategies could be shared.Thanks!,4
2834,Thank you,4
2841,A very useful course full of everyday strategies for parents and teachers.,4
2842,Interesting course and quite useful additional sources are provided in this course.,4
2847,Especially the fourth week was very informative and positive.,4
2849,Informative and useful with practical examples to apply right away.,4
2856,Too much question and it takes me too much time on it,4
2859,very good start for iOS developers,4
2866,"I do recommend the course, for both the methodoly and content, the tips it gives, the mindset it developsgo on Ronald !",4
2883,I miss more homework.,4
2886,I think tests should be little more difficult,4
2893,improve and simplify the grammar structure explanation,4
2895,Thanks everyone for such an interesting experience.,4
2904,It's great to have access to the course even when you're not paying the certificate. Tip: make the presentations more attractive.,4
2909,"Good, but Not as accessible as Calculus One as for some abstract concepts, for math amateurs like me. I am still confused where I can put what I learned in this course into practice. But I want to learn more about sequences and series using other resources.",4
2926,"For me this course managed to finally get me over the hurdles in really understanding what is going on in sequences and series. The course is fairly difficult, but then so is the subject matter; and the difficulties were not insurmountable. I would give it 5 stars except for a few spots where a little more explanation would have been helpful e.g., the relationship between the indices in the two forms of the Taylor series for the cosine function.",4
2927,"Great course! The material is presented in a logical order and in an easy-to-understand way. In the videos, proofs for most of the concepts and methods are discussed, so ""why?"" is no longer a mystery. The textbook also is a good supplement to the videos. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about sequences and series.",4
2928,"The best part about this course is the way Prof. explains the intuition behind most of the proofs. For example, it seems(to me) more intuitive that harmonic series shall converge but the way Prof. developed intuition that harmonic series diverges, was awesome. This central theme in both the calculus courses from Prof Jim Fowler helped a lot.",4
2937,"The professor is extremely passionate and well-informed about the subject. However it would have been a lot better if he used a more visual approach to explaining things (including graphs and diagrams).The positives about the course are:- There’s plenty of proofs for those who are so inclined. So you really get to understand what’s leading up to a particular formula.- The professor shows some very interesting applications such as showing why 22/7 and pi are not the same and constructing a bridge with only one side (harmonic tower) which is a real eye opener.- He shows you that the concepts in calculus are all deeply connected. There is not a single piece of the puzzle that does not fit with the other pieces. Getting this realization is probably one of the key value propositions of this course.- The mentors in the forums are extremely helpful and respond quickly to your queries.- You learn a lot about using formal mathematical symbols.- The questions are incredibly hard and very little in way of practice examples are provided. This forces you to up your game and really try to understand how things work. Things that are learned with a lot of hard effort are retained much better than things learned without much effort. Hence, I highly recommend this course and am grateful that I took it!If you are the kind of person who likes everything to be served cut and cleaned on a silver platter, you are not likely to enjoy this course. However, if you enjoy solving puzzles with often missing, incomplete, or poorly presented information then this course is exhilarating!The course can be improved by:1. Adding more concrete example with real numbers to show how some of the theorems work.2. Adding more graphs to show how the functions look.3. Adding more practice problems with clear explanations in case you get it wrong.4. Ensuring that exercises are in sync with the sections being presented (for example, in the middle of the course we’re asked a question which involves the Taylor series which is not presented till the last week.)5. Adding more worked out examples with detailed explanations6. Avoiding using confusing variable names (like “little m” and “big m”)I learned a lot in this course.The best lesson was when professor Jim Fowler says that the point of mathematics is not truth but proof. Not whether something is true but why.",4
2940,good course,4
2948,The course is really helpful but I think it would have been much better if there were answers to all the practice quizzes since some of them are really challenging.,4
2954,"This course will supplement your class, but do not use it as a single source.",4
2955,"I appreciate the free course, but it seems that this course is not comprehensively prepared like the first course. 1) There are no solution, and sometimes nothing at all, provided under the wrong answer of each task in practice quizs. And 2), the tasks are not 100% related with previous radios, which could be frastrating for people like me who want to solve all tasks before entering into the next session. 3) Some important points are missing in the video whereas less significant points are overdressed in excessive details.",4
2961,"Consistent video format, good explanations, video length not too long but also not too short.",4
2962,"I give four stars rather than five because I felt that the course seemed less well executed than Calculus One by the same author. He set a high bar for himself. Still, I learned a lot and do appreciate it. I felt the practice quizzes could have been more helpful in the explanation of wrong answers as was the case in Calculus One.",4
2963,Very slow beginning and quite few gaps between videos and quiz but very nice to go back to basics and practice calculus again,4
2964,"There are a few mistakes that you need to look out for (check the discussion forum), but overall, this is a very good course!",4
2987,"Very good, Focussed in learn the philosophy and know some mathematical tricks in the proofs. It was funny!!",4
2993,"Great explanation, challenging quizzes. May be very difficult for those who aren't used to grasping concept in maths.",4
2998,"This really is a good extention to the Calculus One course. A bit harder to understand, but I assume this was the main idea of Jim Fowler - to explain, as he mentions in one of the videos, that mathematics is not about calculations - it's about insight. So be prepared for less technical calculations in the tests and more creative thinking on how to solve this or that problem.",4
3006,"This is a really helpful course for learning information about Calculus two. However, some areas in explanations were confusing so I had to search more information from the internet and from other professors.",4
3014,Great teacher. The method of explaining things with pieces of paper was helpful and more interactive than lines simply appearing in the screen. Unfortunately the course is based on calculations and many proofs were left behind.,4
3020,"Organized like the ideal textbook, but I would have preferred that there be more practice problems on quizzes.",4
3025,Really enjoy the enthusiasm of the lectures. A couple of lectures run over the material a little quickly.,4
3032,Again Jim does a really great job. Care and attention to the presentation of the explanation. Really takes into account he's performing for a camera not a lecture hall. My score is 4/4. I'm not qualified to give the 5th as I can't speak to what has been included and omitted from the content.Bring on multivariate calculus as an on-demand Mooc!,4
3037,it is nice how to learn maths by this way < cause i hate the way of egyptian Drs in my university teach us by reading from books which already i have in my hands and solve the same boring examples >thank you coursea :D,4
3052,....might be considered as a good one,4
3054,Really enjoy the energy of the professor. More practice questions would take this to the next level.,4
3066,"I took this course to practice my Spanish, hoping it would be like the course Learning How to Learn that is in English. If you can watch that course in English instead or along with this one or even just reading the Spanish subtitles, I would suggest that course instead as it is truly amazing. This one is good... as far as it goes. It's hard to follow in the footsteps of Learning How to Learn though because it's one of the best courses in anything I've ever taken. This was a good course to practice my Spanish listening though! There are a few good ideas in here, so worth it.",4
3071,little bit slow but very good. some extra tools added that make it slow and boring but it makes it very interesting if we understand its benefit,4
3072,Nicely designed course to learn AngularJS,4
3081,"Should be a more in depth course.Although for an introduction into AngularJS, it is a very good course.",4
3082,"Thank you for these lessons, answered my pressing questions about web development",4
3084,"good and useful course, but includes some content (unit testing) that is extraneous and could be in a separate course",4
3085,Awesome course,4
3091,"This is excellent training for the person who likes to keep up with the latest and greatest front-end developments. If you don't like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you. I had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be: stay flexible, be prepared to use obscure tools (that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood), expect change and adversity, become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat. This is probably good approximation of real world experience where you would need to come in on a project and bail them out of angularjs damnation. Be prepared to be frustrated.",4
3094,"some difficult, but it's so useful and powerful languages",4
3097,Great course.,4
3102,This is a Great Course. However I think that is a wonderful option to have an intermediate leve with angularJs.,4
3103,Should be updated with angular 2 components. Rest it was awesome,4
3107,"This was my first online course. I have everyday given 2 to 3.30hrs in this course. As angular.js is really in demand, I was eager to learn it and this course is good in terms of the lectures by prof. Muppala , materials and the exercises. Exercises are doable but let me say this to the would be en-rollers that if you miss a tiny winy thing between the scrips, you will have to devote a hell lotta time to fix it . The assignments are challenging and those gave me the feel that angular is not that easy peasy at all. Submitting the assignments on time is suggestible as late submission can create a mess to get required number of reviews on time. I have submitted two assignments after deadline and had to request a lot of classmates to review my submission. Prof Muppala is one great teacher. He is good at explaining stuffs so easily which are actually not that easy. Overall it was a good experience. I am looking forward to what this skill will offer me in my career ahead and also looking forward to learn more from coursera.",4
3110,Very in depth and practical course that gets you jump-started on AngularJS. The quizzes were a bit too simple but I imagine the assignments would have more content (since they are locked behind purchase). Would love to see a Angular 2 course as well.,4
3115,"this course overall is great. the content needs to be more in depth and give more compact information in each session. also need to give more detail why we should do certain step instead of just tell how to do.the course offer resources, and this aids with further self-pace learning, which is helpful. the ppt resource could cover more content in detail.overall it is a good course.",4
3118,good. its a worth your time,4
3126,It was a great course,4
3127,this course is good . thank you for this information .we look forward more,4
3136,A well presented course with broad coverage of AngularJS. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Coursera platform is excellent and easy to use.,4
3146,"Amazing Course, made me understand Angular in an easy way. It gave me a good quick start. Hats of to the teacher for all the hard work.",4
3150,Thanks to Mr. Jogesh for carrying out complex concepts with ease.,4
3157,"Good course, cover most important topics in didatc way. But the code quality is poor and I advice to study the John Papa's Angula code style to learn a better way of using AngularJS.",4
3164,Nice course. However I am hearing scratching noises when the tutor is speaking which is little disturbing.,4
3170,Very useful course with excellent course material. However there were some problems with the audio quality. Fixing them would make this course really enjoyable.,4
3176,nice course and nice explanation,4
3177,Excellent source of information.,4
3179,Excellent course. I was very helpful!!,4
3193,"Very good course, go ahead",4
3195,The tutor is exceptionally good. It included all the sources for documentation but I felt I learned more from by reading the Angularjs official documentation than from this course. Assignments covered a variety of concepts.,4
3198,Quite a good experience.,4
3199,Very nice explanations!,4
3205,"Professor just does not explain the concepts well, just reads the code snippets. You need to figure things out the hard way. You don't get too much help from the moderators as well.",4
3207,a great course and good instructor.,4
3209,"very informative and challenging course, i enjoyed finishing it.",4
3212,Teacher is really bad. Terrible.,4
3213,I definitely enjoyed doing this course. The exercises really helped me understand it and it makes you more involved.,4
3218,Well i am surprised that Angularjs is not easy to learn but how easily and smartly you teach this course.. Really appreciated Sir!!,4
3227,clear and the examples are very useful!,4
3234,"Examples are clear, very good introductory course. Can using w3schoool as reference",4
3237,I recommend this course for naive to medium level expertise.,4
3239,Good quality content and great instructor. I recommend it!It does not cover though a very important feature from angular: directives.,4
3262,sometimes it's hard to get things.. .. but it's very useful and strong course,4
3264,Had good content but description was a like scattered manner. It could have better if explanation should be in fluent manner.,4
3272,"Easy to understand, but hard to listen. I think we need a American teacher",4
3283,great course,4
3285,"Very nice course, but it would be even better if it was about Angular 2, since it is to become the standard AngularJS is/was.",4
3288,"also, good course but not free to access the assignment",4
3294,"Very Nice Course. Takes us through everything and enables us with basic promised objective. Good Luck to Course creators, keep adding more to it.",4
3298,Great course,4
3305,"A good introduction to AngularJS, but falls short on connecting the dots in places.",4
3309,"Pros: a lot of good content, worth 8 weeks of study, so good bang for the buck. Takes modular approach, where things are gradually taken apart and shown how to improve using another Angular module or approach.Cons: can be a little academical, very time-intensive.I have a much better understanding now of MVC concept using JS framework.",4
3315,very practical,4
3323,"Not a bad course, but videos must be shorter. Divide 30-40 min videos into small ones",4
3331,"The course is very good, the teacher very clear, easy to follow. In yet it is a basic course",4
3350,Good to begin with Angular,4
3354,Very good course overall. It could dig into a little more detail but given the duration and workload it's still pretty good. I think it's targeted towards people who are either working or studying full-time and taking this on the side.,4
3357,"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. This course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if you're interested in going on to develop intermediate skills.My only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the ""additional materials"" at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and weren't thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesn't do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Gulp).However, this course is still amazing for a free course. If you've done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademy's), you've really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation. To conclude, despite it's minor flaws, this is still the best free introduction to AngularJS online today. Good luck!",4
3360,"Hard work, I had to watch most of the videos at least twice so took much more time than I anticipated. I'm glad I stuck with it because it made the start of the next course much easier. Very satisfying to have completed it.",4
3361,"The course is very good. My only point of concern is the installation procedures of packages, where the instructor either is installing an old package or not using any new installation procedures causing students to have a whole lot of issues with setting up their development environment",4
3364,"Great course, just a few hiccups along the way with setting up environments. Had I not read a bit in the Discussion Forums before I started this course, I would've done the course on Windows and encounter all the problems my classmates did with setting up a development environment on Windows. Students should be advised to do this course on Linux or on a Mac.",4
3365,Provides a thorough knowledge but could be extended to one more week to cover testing part.,4
3374,Good Angular exercises. But I think that testing should get its own segment. Becomes a bit lengthy with 30 min videos and only scraping the surface on the subject.,4
3375,"The course is nice, however the assignments are the same every time and the pace is too slow. The final week suddenly too compact, and testing/yo is not assigned at all.",4
3377,Very good course and very pleasant Professor !,4
3389,"Tougher than the Bootstrap course, but it was worth it.",4
3397,"Highly recommended for beginners! The professor explain concepts in a neat, well-paced and clear manner. There's ample support for all the assignments too!",4
3400,Thanks for this introduction to AngularJS.Unfortunately we have to pay in order to obtain a certificate of accomplishment.,4
3402,"More on Angular, less on Gulp and Grunt. Lectures about them are so tedious, and when you need them you get the finished code and modify it via tutorial :)",4
3413,"Very interesting course and very well structured. The subjects are handled with the correct depth corresponding to its importance. The indicated time spent by week corresponds accurately to the time needed, if you have some previous experience in web development.The exercises are focused in the important details and very well organized.If you have interest in client side web development and particularly in Angular, this is a very good opportunity to learn.Probably in a near future this course must be updated to cover Angular 2.0.It really worth the time spent!",4
3425,Great introduction to Angular! Learnt a lot.,4
3433,"I think it's a very good introduction to AngularJS. You learn and understand what you're doing in almost lessons. I'd hardly recommend it to any beginner !!!I found that the 4rth week was very very compressed. You could spend 1 more week explaining all the Front-End tools such as Gulp, Grunt, Yo (Yeoman) etc. And go deeper with the AngularJS as well.In some points I felt myself alone with no teacher support regardless there's a students forum. I'd improve the transparency and the communication teacher-student.Anyway I very happy to spent that time on this course he explains really paciently :D",4
3435,"Very good course, just a few notes short of excelence.",4
3444,"A lot of material for one course. Would appreciate more discussion of package managers, how to find packages that may be useful.",4
3449,"Pretty good coverage of Angular as whole, how to setup a Angular project, and how it fits into bigger picture web development.Criticisms:- Overall, the code presentation (in exercises, provided files, and the slides) was ugly. Good looking and properly styled code is important to ingrain, and this course fell pretty short there. Code was (very) poorly indented, had inconsistent single vs. double quotes, and didn't follow any style guide out there. Use some beautifier and make sure jshint doesn't have any suggestions for improvement! Slides need at least some monospaced font; better would be colored code snippets or screenshots.- The Gulp and Grunt week felt pretty strangely structured. The two task runners just had such long lectures videos that it was a really big hump to get over, especially since we didn't use Grunt later.- (harder to fix) My files got pretty inconsistent with what I needed to copy/download over week-by-week from the course. Some sort of git repository and easier way to pull changes would be good. I ended up version controlling every week and every week's assignment.So yeah, I'd say this was worth taking, but some parts of the setup are pretty frustrating and version controlling makes life much easier.",4
3450,"The course is excellent; however, it requires more time than promised...",4
3463,Very practical approach to teach AngularJS,4
3468,I missed a lot of it because many NPM modules wouldn't install on my Windows environment. :(,4
3482,"Good introduction to AngularJS. Moreover their provide a wide variety of additional information related to the course, which is very useful to enlarge the basic contents studied.",4
3485,"Very good course. It allows to learn the basics of angular js very fast and easily. I only missed a little more of content in directives scopes, but here you can learn a lot.",4
3487,Great teacher. Great Angular overview. I wish the instruction went deeper into Angular than it did.,4
3517,"Content of the course is great. However , at time assignments are very difficult to understand. There are probably very few students who take this course at any time , so you dont get much help from forums. TA's and Professor as well have not responded to any of our questions. I dont expect any course to be cakewalk but at least some help need to be provided.",4
3519,"Very interesting, explanations are clear and easy to understand",4
3520,"Lectures and content were great. The theme of the course is to provide insight into the approaches used to investigate approximation algorithms for NP hard problems and the theoretical techniques used to assess the effectiveness of the approximation algorithm against the best answer. The production quality of the lecture videos and slides was high.The content of the quizzes and assignments was mostly appropriate and well organized. However, the authors appeared to struggle with the platform. At times there were comments such as, you need to enter something in the box but it was not actually being used. Answers to the assignments required using substantial mathematical notation, but LaTex was not enabled in the discussion or text entry boxes (no longer available in the Coursera platform??) so the work around was to upload answers to a bunch of questions as a single PDF document. Flow of the individual modules (lectures, slides, quizzes) was inconsistent, varying from week to week.",4
3527,"Lectures are well-organized. Some assignments (e.g., Assignment 3, which involves merely understanding an algorithm, rather than proving correctness and approx. ratio) are extraordinarily stupid and somewhat tangential.",4
3533,"This course is quite advanced and the assignments require prerequisite skills to prove time complexity etc. If you are upto it, then for sure take this course. The instructor is quite thorough.",4
3543,"Good info, lots to think about",4
3545,This is an interesting topic which I have never really given a thought before. Eye-opening and really make you think,4
3549,Very well structured course.,4
3564,"The projects are fun, but the course is too short and abbreviated.",4
3569,"Overall, I enjoyed this course. Especially from week 1 to 3 where the course contents were simply amazing.It would be great if week 4 and 5 can engage the students like week 1 to 3, and the forum can be more alive.Thank you.",4
3571,"This is a really useful course. The project is quite relevant, and the work with breadth first search, Dijkstra, and A* Search are really interesting!",4
3574,This course was excellent! I learned so much and I am now able to understand the significance of knowing how Algorithms and Data Structures are related in a practical way. I,4
3580,I think it would be better if the lectures can go a little bit deeper on the topics in this course.,4
3584,Nicely explained and challenging projects.,4
3592,Really nice finish to the specialization.,4
3593,I give really high marks for this course as the graphs are presented in a proper and practical manner. I have a suggestion to present the High Level of Graphs more in the area of Information theory. Otherwise it is nice approach and very good implementation of the material and exams.,4
3595,"The course content and presentation was excellent. I love the large-project format of the classes in this specialization. I only wish this course had more resources for working offline, at a level that matches the previous courses in the specialization.",4
3596,good job however I think it was quite short and quite shallow,4
3597,This is an awesome course with great stuff for learning and practical graphs concept in programming with some useful algorithms like A*.,4
3611,"The contents were pretty basic for me, but they were presented clearly. All in all I liked the review this course gave me.",4
3613,"For me, it is easier to grasp algorithms that are written out than audio/video description. I would have given 5 stars if the course material accommodated different learning styles for each chapter. I had to do a fair amount of searching for information on the A Star search algorithm to the understand the subtle details.",4
3630,"At first the course is hands on, later on it becomes more of theory. This would have been a challenging course if we had more harder graph problems to solve though.",4
3643,Course was well paced. Assignments were relevant. Only shortcoming I believe was that the last two weeks of the course did not require any submission of a coding assignment. Only required a quiz.I feel that the course would benefit from a requirement to submit some code each week.,4
3658,"Good course to build confidence in building a class from scratch.But, I expected more from this course. A few lectures could have been devoted to popular design patterns used in Graph problems maybe.One more assignment to actually make the students work on heuristics for solving NP-Hard problems would have been helpful.",4
3662,"A few more graph algorithms and their implementations, if added to the course, would be nice.",4
3664,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks.The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. (For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week.) Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course.Overall, they did a great job!",4
3674,A great course as the previous courses for the specialization. I know that the week 4's materials are out of this specialization's scope but I think it's alright to delve in more about P and NP problems. That material is somehow still incomprehensible for me.,4
3681,"Very interesting programming assignment for the BFS, Dijkstra and A* methods. Great job with that.The coverage of the TSP was weak -- room for improvement there. Perhaps include a programming assignment.Overall, the course was a worthwhile investment of time.",4
3684,"Great instructors, videos and activities. The projects are really enjoyable to enroll.",4
3687,Very easy to follow. It really gives you great tips to improve your time at work.,4
3689,It was a good course but maybe you should include more activities for reforcing the knowledge,4
3692,This course helped me much to understand the basics of C Programming.,4
3695,great learning experience,4
3697,Need a discussion forum.,4
3701,"Amazing course, gives your a good introduction to arduino platform and C programming",4
3704,I learn lot from this course about arduino and the course structure awesome.,4
3705,Good for understanding the basic of an Arduino,4
3706,It gives you all the necessary details regarding Arduino.,4
3708,"Very good introduction to arduino programming and the platform in general. However i expected it to be a more in depth course, however i would recommended it to anyone who just bought an arduino for the first time.",4
3712,It is a very a nice course from my point of view. Teaching standard is good and the way classes have been distinguished become helpful to learn the core concept behind the Arduino.,4
3715,Good introduction to the topic for beginners,4
3716,Good course and instructor.,4
3727,"I'm auditing this series and decided to use the autodesk simulator, highly recommended tool. Overall this class is a practical hands on approach to the subject matter. Enjoyed the presentation and topics.",4
3739,"It was a good course, I wished more courses about Arduino and examples of what we can do with the platform in real life applications. Arduino seems more accessible that raspberry pi, in terms of price (I believe I cannot complete the course about this particular platform), the software (myself I have trouble with Linux, perhaps due to my low level of knowledge), in Arduino I used mostly the 123d simulator, which helped me a lot. I am grateful to Prof. Harris, the Coursera team and the California University.",4
3741,Very enthousiastic teacher and very clear instructions,4
3747,very nice tutorial on Arduino programming for beginners like me.,4
3748,The course is good but little bit theoretical for science that should be 80% practical .,4
3750,"explanation is nice ,.it will be help full if practical implementation is shown using videos",4
3751,Found it helpful.,4
3753,Good introductory courseThis course explains the basics of Arduino and explains C programming which is essential for Arduino sketches.This course motivated me in further learning about the Arduino.,4
3754,"Very Good lessons, great for understanding all the concepts and inpire you tu go deep to resolve the assignements. Great course!!!",4
3756,"A quick short course to get familiar with the hardware and very basic concepts of embedded systems like debugging, UART and serial communication.",4
3763,"Basic introduction. Useful, but could use some more complexity.",4
3766,"Very nice code. Teaches you the basics of Arduino. You may need to know C programming language, if you don't know you can learn it.",4
3769,"The lecturer and structure were very good. Five Stars.Sadly, I felt the course could have used a bit more substance. Less than hour of lectures per week and only one programming assignment left me wanting more. By contrast after taking https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/home/welcome I realy felt like I had a grasp on the material.",4
3774,Great course !,4
3776,"The course is well structured and the lectures are very good. However, It could use about 2 more modules that go into more detail about c programming in arduino.",4
3779,"Good programme for beginners, very resourceful.",4
3782,A very good course. It does not teach you everything about C programming but does a very good job of teaching the bare minimum required to understand and implement simple C programs.The Arduino Platform is very well explained.,4
3783,Needs more than 4 weeks worth of material. Assignments and quizzes should be free.,4
3786,Good introductory course.,4
3788,really good introduction course to the Arduino platform,4
3791,"Great course, so much fun!!",4
3793,Good intro but too simple.,4
3795,"This is a good course, especially for beginners as one can learn the basics without spending too much time or getting confused by too many technical terms.",4
3800,Nice course for beginners!,4
3802,overall a good course. Teaches you the basics of arduino and how to integrate c language with the arduino,4
3807,Wonderful I'm getting further in the mastery of the IOT knowledge for my future ideas.,4
3809,It covers all the programming basics that are required for the setup of ARDUINO setup.Very helpful.,4
3812,Very good for people new to programing.,4
3825,Excellent and we'll taught,4
3830,awesome course... but some more program and there implementation should be provided,4
3831,Good introductiong for inexperient users.,4
3838,"The course is useful ,teaches about different types of debugging but lacks examples of these systems.Good intro the the arduino.Thanks a lot.",4
3842,Good but a lot of technical parts all though they are discounted as not needed to know!,4
3847,"Great course, awesome professor, I wish it would include more wiring and actual projects in the making, just to get the bigger picture.",4
3863,Very basic info and really easy. You can complete the course in just a weekend!Really nice for a beginner!,4
3867,"Had joined for free(non-specialization), it was good. Got a basic overview on ardunio. I had never worked on ardunio, but on AVR microcontroller. If you are looking for basic overview, its really good. Thanks to coursera :)",4
3871,really good,4
3874,"Good course. Prof. Ian is very good. Only I miss a deeper discussion, more complete examples and assignments. Thanks a lot.",4
3880,reviewing the classmates assignments should only be possible after submitting the own work.some more sophisticated programming challenges should be required.,4
3888,Instructive and fun!,4
3891,"I felt like the C Programming parts were a bit too fast, specially the enviroment setup. But I loved this course! Congratulations and thank you!",4
3896,"The teacher is really didactic and the material is good, but the course is too basic. It could be completed in a weekend. Maybe all this course could be only a Module.",4
3897,Very useful for amateur learners. Thank a lot University of California!!,4
3901,"Nice course for beginners, I actually enjoyed it. Just same remark as for previous one - please review text of subtitles, it's really awful and I guess it's even funny for native english speakers",4
3906,Very interesting and intuitive. Thanks.,4
3909,Introduces the basics of Arduino and C programming. Not a lot of content but gets you ready for the next course in the 4-course Specialisation.,4
3911,"Good overall syllabus, but needs more concentration on Objective C.",4
3913,"Very good professor, good course for a start.",4
3916,that good!,4
3921,A good start in the world of Arduino.,4
3922,The very basics. Overall good.,4
3926,Easy going introduction to the topic.,4
3930,Interesting but should be more challenging,4
3939,Great...job...Really heplful..,4
3940,It is an easy to follow but very basic course. It might be good for a newbie but I expected a little more.,4
3941,I found this to be very useful in getting started with both C and the Arduino - neither of which I've studied/used before. I felt the lectures were well delivered and the videos of the Arduino board and circuit helped me to connect components correctly. I suspect some of the problems I experienced in submitting my projects might be resolved through some more detailed advice within the course notes. I'm looking forward very much to the companion course involving interfacing with the Arduino.,4
3942,"A very good course for the beginer of Arduino. After finish this course, you will feel that you are standing at the starting line of the Arduino journey.",4
3954,A good introduction to the Arduino platform. Looking forward to attending the next course.,4
3958,Good beginners and introductory course to Arduino and C. Prof. Harris is a brilliant lecturer.,4
3993,"Though not too inclusive, it's a great course for introduction.",4
3996,"This was a very enjoyable experience, thank you all for the opportunity.",4
3997,Definitely interesting.,4
4001,like it most the epicurean philosophy,4
4003,"A good follow- up to the previous course. The material is well organised and gives a profound overview while still inciting further investigation, leaving enough room for expansion of the mind and new thoughts on... almost everything.",4
4007,Beside the annoying loud music in the intro of each video it is Insightful.,4
4008,Another fine MOOC by the prof. I really like her dry delivery style.,4
4011,A good starting point to ancient philosophy .,4
4019,Interesting overview. Would have appreciated more time on Hellenistic Philosophy,4
4031,Clearly presented.course which focuses only on the principal question and themes of each of the 4 philosophies. I found it extremely valuable as it structured in a logical way these issues and also related themt modern life. My only criticism relates to the grading method of the final assignment 0 or 1 is far too simplistic.,4
4038,Really like the mix of theory and practical application,4
4049,Good coverage of multiple topics.Very basic level overview,4
4078,"Loved the course videos and lectures were entertaining. I was a bit dissappointed with the outright dismissal of non-traditional understnadings of these ancient monuments and thought the explanations on why and how they were built, were lightly treated.A great course ...",4
4095,Excellent combination for education purpouse,4
4108,"It's a good course. Funny and intelligent, but it can be a little more challenging.",4
4113,The examples were great and I would have like more of them.,4
4121,Thank you for the ideas. I teach foreign languages and I find many of your activities will help me plan more demanding activities us,4
4124,"Interesting beginning level class for those who are interested in teaching arts. You can have great activities, instructors and classmates and the whole learning process is just so fun!",4
4125,Great and fun activities with solid academic foundations,4
4129,A very nice course. Could be longer.,4
4154,"Very informative video sessions, enjoyed the process and study of the course",4
4156,"I found the presentations to be very clear and focused. In addition, the readings were a good introduction to the foundation and current thinking in the field.I was disappointed in the difficulty in connecting with other students. That would have enhanced the learning experience for me. I am new to Coursera, and understand thismay be a difficult aspect of the programs to control, but it's worth a try.",4
4158,Interesting approach for teachers and those involved in any type of learning processes. Useful reading material,4
4160,Very instructive and fun.The team know their work and they are a great help for teachers.,4
4180,"the last peer review problem is much too hard for what I learned from the course material, if there is a more specific instruction for the assignment will be better.",4
4182,Good Course! But focus should be more on OOPs Concepts through video lectures to better understand it.,4
4184,"Great acceleration of the specialization compared to the first course. It covers modern approaches (as map-reduce-filter implementation in purrr), nicely explains debugging, benchmarking, OOP etc. I would recommend this as a kick starter for more advanced R programming.",4
4188,Well structured and easy for one with no teaching experience to flow with. Kudos for the job well delivered.,4
4190,An opportunity to continue to reflect on one's teaching within an engaging and compelling framework.,4
4192,"This course have good teachers and material. The articles of peers which you should read and assess are very Interesting, deep and curious.",4
4200,The Commonwealth Education Trust provides you of a diverse approach to the teaching and learning issues with a global perspective over the studies and development concerning the matter. The course in particular touches a lot of interesting and important aspects to pay attention during the learning processes that may take place in institutions and relationships within these.,4
4203,I have really enjoyed this course.Many twwhanks to Prof John and Dr. Dennis for their inputs,4
4205,THE AUDIO QUALITY IS NOT CLEAR BUT CONTENTS ARE VERY USEFUL.,4
4209,"I needed these introductory guides to help me assess my own intentions, strengths, weaknesses in a more structured way. I have enjoyed the whole series. Only one technical issue: sound quality could always be better.",4
4215,"It hard to work with Arduino, and it's harder to work with the Iskra. But the course are very useful. I like the way the teacher guide us to do the experiment. Step by step, try and fail, you will finish this course with pround.Thanks you so much!",4
4219,"More respect after the course than before, as I thought this would be a pretty easy Excel course, but finishing it called lot of real work and statistical and modelling understanding.",4
4221,Good for learning statistical analysis using real examples (bank credit card application) and hands on the data in the final project!,4
4225,"Very useful knowledge in this course. Although, some of the quizzes require some small fixes, and there are minor mistakes in some lectures.",4
4230,"Good course, bit disjointed at times and some of the maths is rushed through, or not really relevant. Not sure I need proofs on why standardising figures results in easier to use data, maybe just show us how to do the analysis and apply it to more examples in real life.",4
4236,Solid class focused on the mechanics of building and evaluating binary classification models using Excel,4
4237,"The course is both tough and interesting. The interesting bit comes from developing a model for a credit card company, which is a rather creative and captivating process. The tough part is in hectic learning of a vast array of statistical terms, often poorly explained – and alost never applied to practice (it is true that some of statistical metrics are ""applied"" in quizzed but it is unclear what's their purpose besides computing yet another number).",4
4241,"A bit too academic, I would like to see explanations on Excels and business cases.",4
4244,"The course is very challenging, but very interesting. I will probably suggest a bit more of staff support in the last week, specially the final project which is very challenging and demanding. A bit more of orientation will be really good.",4
4246,It's not Excel... it's applied probability theory using Excel workbooks.,4
4252,very very interesting and well explained,4
4254,Tougher than the first in the specialization. You have to spend time on the material to succeed. In the end a lot of the concepts were not that difficult to figure out - don't overthink things as well!,4
4261,Good Course so far. But lacks indepth explanation. Courses such as probability need to be taken prior to this,4
4262,Course is very good! All examples are very clear and detailed. And a spreadsheet is provided to follow along during class. Only bad thing is that it was not so clear this course is heavily related to Math. Data Analysis = Math & Statistics. ;-),4
4267,"I feel this is way too hard for people who are not good at math, or haven't studies math for a long time. Took me longer time to figure all questions out.",4
4268,Difficult as hell.When You complete it You really start understanding this area but I think due to level of difficulty teaching staff should be a little more active.Big difference in difficulty in lessons(which are easy)and test(which are sometimes incredibly difficult).If You want to work in Big Data field You HAVE TO complete this course but...expect hell.,4
4269,"really use full,but before this cousre we need to acquire some mathematical and statstical knowledge.",4
4272,Too difficult for a beginner,4
4279,I work with excel and thousands of lines of data everyday. I found this class to be challenging,4
4285,"The explainations are a bit hard to follow if you are in a hurry, some times the course concepts just jump onto you. The techniques and content are really really great and very relavent, but the instructional value can be further ehnanced.",4
4291,A great course to learn excel for analytics.,4
4294,This is not an easy course and some concepts/tasks weren't clearly addressed.But the instructor is great!,4
4320,"The course is quite tough for me, but I enjoyed the topics discussed, primary between a binary model and a linear regression model. The addition of Excel into this course adds an application layer, which helps me to bring the concepts to the working world as well, and not just plain academic knowledge.",4
4323,not easy but rather clear speech,4
4328,Be prepared to study a lot as the material is comprehensive and vast.,4
4332,It's just not only Excel...is mostly data analysis.,4
4334,"Although more about Prob and Stat than learning to use Excel, concepts of binary classification and entropy are very interesting and are taught very deliberately and thoroughly. More practise quizes and worked out examples would be even better.",4
4342,very good - step by step and clear.,4
4347,"quite a lot techniques to learn. Just wish they could explain more about applications of those techniques, in more details, which however might be hard to get done in 5 weeks though.",4
4349,So far i have found it useful. Most of the introduction elements are elementary but it gives you a chance to build up your knowledge and apply it as you go.,4
4358,"Very heavy on the stats front, not so much on utilizing Excel but I learned some useful things in this class.",4
4363,Good course. Wish it was more hands on working with excel.,4
4374,Difficulty (at least for me) was non-linear. Weeks 1-2 were very basic with weeks 3-4 moving into parts of stats that I don't recall from my college course so it took some extra work to apply the models.,4
4376,Very interactive and simple to learn course.the video lectures are very clear to understand and worksheets are helpful to gain a better understanding of the topic.,4
4383,Tough class but filled with useful and applicable ata analysis using the most popular and available program to do this work... Be prepared to get a little frustrated and watch the instructions more than once..... It's not Cousera fun fluff !!!,4
4392,"Great course, just a little too technical",4
4396,Highly useful and practical course. it can be a bit challenging for Uni graduate from irrelevant field.the First course and the visualisation course from this series of specialisation is okay .,4
4401,Not exactly for business use,4
4409,"I found this course to be very challenging, but I am grateful for the knowledge and the new perspective. Thanks!",4
4410,"towards end of the course, specifically linear regression week, a lot of buzzwords are strung together. I wish, the instructor would be a little bit more sparing in their usage together (together is the keyword). Eg ""This is the connection between linear regression and mutual information in a parametric model where we have gaussian distributions"" I feel that each term in isolation I know what they mean, but when strung together, I am unclear how to process the meaning.",4
4413,"I would have appreciated a bit more of a hands-on process in building the workbooks (with proper instruction of course) and more formal presentation of the formulas being used, but overall, I got a lot out of this course and enjoyed it along the way.",4
4415,I really enjoyed the course. Professor was very good at explaining everything. And the team was very helpful. And this course is definitely for people who already has a good backround in exel and working with data.,4
4417,"I missed some more content in certain areas of the course (i.e. histograms). Apart from that, great course and great explanations by Daniel Egger!",4
4419,The training course excellent however I would like to find the quiz for the week number 1,4
4434,"Really good course, I think the most value is at the end when you are able to apply the concept learned in the final assignment",4
4436,Very helpful course. Intense concepts covered and good examples to master them. Thanks!,4
4438,Good course,4
4444,Very useful,4
4449,"Lots of good information. However, this course could be structured a lit bit better. More examples and small practice exercises within the lectures would significantly improve the retention of material.You should posses at least basic knowledge of statistics.",4
4452,"I believe pivot tables also plays a big part in Excel, wish they could incorporate that too.",4
4455,It's not only basic Excel course but you can learn a lot of useful Excel functions like log or ln.,4
4457,Learning some great things!,4
4478,"Quite an useful course for Excel application in business decision-making. But I think the final project is a little more difficult than weekly assignments. And only Quiz 1 has some hints about the potential problems we might come across during the quiz. The linear regression part, especially multivariate linear regression, need more explanations how to derive the matrix in Excel. Even though I followed every steps and referred other classmates' discussions, I cannot work out the matrix with Excel. So sad :(",4
4479,Clear and useful. But you need a text book to this course.,4
4480,Good but the final project could have been setup up with better instructions.,4
4484,"Good content, some materials were difficult but the video lecture were rushed.",4
4485,"Amazing volume of topics covered and in a manner that is not overly complicated in terms of testing methodology, but still requires you to do the work. There are still several bugs with the course, test answers and instruction documents on the site, but clearly the course is new so hopefully that will be resolved in coming iterations of the class.",4
4489,"The course is more on analysis techniques as opposed to Excel shortcuts, tips and tricks. It certainly helps if you have a good background in algebra-level math; if you're looking for a course on how to be an Excel Power User, this might not be the best fit. Otherwise, what I learned here is useful for me. Thanks!",4
4494,Great course... Self Explanatory.. Loved the details.. Must take this one,4
4496,I wish the duration between each week was a bit more and there was an option to chat with the faculty directly,4
4497,This is more than just an Excel course. It also covers a lot of statistics and the application of statistics in Excel (with pre-built template). I think more focus on how to build things in Excel will be useful.,4
4499,Love it,4
4503,its very helpful course,4
4506,If we would have use a real example to explain the concepts prof Eagger,4
4509,Great information included. I feel like I know much more about modelling data than when I started. The quizzes can be in that without the hints on the discussion forum I don't know how I would have completed them just based on the information in the videos.,4
4523,Very challenging and wish there were more exercises throughout to strengthen understanding.,4
4528,Amazing to get a grasp on the concepts! Might need further inmersion on the Excel area,4
4530,"Entering this course with a pretty in-depth knowledge of Excel, it was good to be able to brush up on some things I don't use on a day-to-day basis such as VLOOKUP and STANDARDIZE functions. The subject material is quite good, AOC and Binary Classifications were very interesting to learn about and have tons of applications, particularly in operation optimization problems/cases. One point of suggestion would be to double-check and clean up the accompanying Excel files. Some of the material was confusing to follow along with. If you could define cells, arrays, and tables for instance it would make the material much more intuitive to follow-along with.",4
4544,Most concepts are rather theoretical and it feels more like a probability and stats course. There is not much focus on excel implementation and life is made seemingly easy with all the templates provided.,4
4547,"Great course, great professor and great TA in community discussion. Can't give 5 stars as course introduction and content are not really matching. As per introduction anybody can take and learn this course, but indeed it is far from reality. If you don't have good math and statistic background then you better learn them first...I personally learnt a lot from this course even though could not get the certificate. Thanks everyone.",4
4548,Extremely helpful,4
4550,"good course for combining stats and excel, but it is difficult for new learners with no knowledges on stats at all",4
4552,This course really helps in doing Analytics with the help of EXCEL,4
4555,"This course is very good! The inconvenient is the lack of exercices, however, the explanation are clear and relevant; we go to the basics.",4
4556,It will be better adding examples related with engineering cases (this is for technical people in any branch of engineering).,4
4559,Good topic and resources to learn. However the business terminologies sometimes are confusing.,4
4560,Thanks to Duke university for offering these professional courses free,4
4569,"Overall, the course is great except for some minor inconvenience of the lecture. Some concepts are not carefully explain like incidence etc",4
4573,The course include structured elements and very usefull information to turn you quickly from beginner to master.,4
4574,More worksheets and examples would help :) the course is quite dense in terms of the number of topics covered,4
4576,A very good COURSE....i was looking it sinc a long timethank you COURSERA,4
4577,A bit very difficult course...full of formula,4
4585,It's very useful to learn how excel able to handle different mathematical models,4
4591,Exceptionally good.great experience.,4
4596,This is a good introduction about Astrobiology. I'll continue my research about this specific topic with lot of interest.,4
4598,"The syllabus needs a bit of update, as many new developments happened since this course was put together. Nonetheless, still very much relevant as an introduction to astrobiology.",4
4601,"Very interesting stuff. Nice use of static imagery, but might have made more use of video.",4
4611,Good course. A few sections could be updated and some materials seen more in-depth.,4
4618,This was a simple and interesting course I would love it to be a little bit broader and present the information in more context. But still excellent course.,4
4622,"Very good introductory course that embraces a broad range of topics. The depth of coverage, however, is somewhat shallow in comparison to other scientific courses aimed at beginners, such as the outstanding 'Origins' course from the University of Copenhagen.",4
4625,The teaching methods and pace were quite fine but it lacked a bit of media presentation pizzazz. It was definitely sufficient but could've been a little better production quality-wise. The professor had an amiable vibe and definitely seem to be a master of his field. I enjoyed it and plan to resume.,4
4626,"Very intensive course, definitely very well detailed and thorough. The tests often rely on paying attention to the smallest details of the lecture, which while frustrating, forces you to learn. Its one of the hardest courses on here, but also the most rewarding when you finish it.",4
4634,I am really enjoying this course. The content is displayed clearly providing a good overview of what astrobiology is.,4
4637,beautiful and interesting course,4
4638,"While a decent overview, the course is a bit dated (2012), One thing that would be nice, is having the key topics that are being talked about, show up on the backdrop. Sometimes, there too much information being presented too quickly.",4
4645,course kept wanting me to verify and give them a picture of me,4
4649,I missed math.,4
4650,"Excellent course, I learned a lot but I think it should have some peer reviewed assignments, like a little research on some topic, so that you have to look for information and learn a lot more in the process.",4
4661,Loved the brief lectures and well structured layout. Definitely a must for those stepping into this wonderful area of multidisciplinary research!,4
4663,"I really enjoyed this course. It threw me, at first, that the whole course was only lectures -- no videos or readings -- but so much of this course will be applicable to teaching biology that it's useful no matter what. I also had a small problem with verifying quizzes on my phone.",4
4667,"Great course, ta!",4
4673,"A very good course, very well presented and didactic.It would be interesting if it were upgraded to the latest results (2013-2015)regardless, I recommend it to everyone interested.",4
4674,"Interesting, But Monotonous. Great Resources And Loving It! :)",4
4683,Great course on a fascinating area of science. The presentation could have been a bit more engaging with some animations though.,4
4684,I loved this course as it helped me understand things that didn't make sense before,4
4688,"About the contents, I was expecting maybe less biological charge and a bit more about astronomy, but maybe that was my mistake. The teacher makes a great job, and I have been learning both astrobiology and English. About practicing English while studying another subject, I would like to appreciate the synchronizing of the subtitles, that were perfect.I totally recommend this course to anyone interesting in solar system, astronomy, biology and the search for extraterrestrial inteligence.",4
4691,A lot of g,4
4699,Thank you very much for this course.I think I now have a good understanding of what Astrobiology is and how it is possible to look out for life on other planets.Hopefully some of the big questions of astrobiology will be answered :),4
4708,Good inte onto the area.,4
4713,"I love this course, it gave me the basic idea of how life could and couldn't start with one situation or another. The impact of some element in our life and how alternative elements have smaller chance to be the backbone of life is not a common thing to think in my everyday life (a fresh air for me)I have difficulty to remember all the project that we all do to search the extraterrestrial life though XD...this course make me think that I now have a basic scientific facts to start build a new story about the early life in earth <3 oh my god, thanks a lot sir!! (^u^)v",4
4717,Brilliant explanation but Professor need to have a little more smile and expression,4
4720,"I really enjoyed learning about astrobiology. We certainly live in interesting times, and this course does an excellent job introducing the students to the current topics and technologies.",4
4727,A very interesting course,4
4729,Very interesting and easy.,4
4731,"This was a very interesting and entertaining course, I enjoyed it a lot and can only recommend it. Thanks!",4
4738,"Almost perfect (for the intro level it was designed for). I would suggest that next time, if possible, instructor image could be a little smaller and the actual images illustrating the points he is talking about a little bigger and more diverse. But that is a minor, please, don't get me wrong. The course was very very good, thank you a lot. Also, the off-line written forum-style discussions were very very good.",4
4740,"This good course; but I have none of those cards, as I can do to pay the course",4
4741,"Very interesting material, and very well explained. The course is slightly out of date, and a couple of the test questions were poorly worded (mostly, these were corrected), but overall it is educational and fun to participate in. I enjoyed it and I learned even more about something that interested me.",4
4742,"I learned a lot from this course. It did feel like some of the videos were out of order in the first two weeks of the class. Overall, it was very interesting and I now know more about a subject I was unfamiliar with previously.",4
4743,Very interesting and informative to get a general overview. Could go a bit more in detail in some techniques and informations.,4
4749,"Very interesting, the professor is a great teller. Unfortunately the tests in week 4 are pretty bad, and the order of the lectures in week 1 and 2 seems off. Well worth 5 stars without these two imperfections.",4
4751,Great introduction to the field of astrobiology. Captivating and very interesting - only problem is that it is too short. I would love to learn more !,4
4761,"The professor explained all the issues clearly. The lectures cover many interesting aspects of astrobiology.I would wish for more updated news though. For example, the New Horizons spacecraft has already reached Pluto.",4
4765,"Very informative, well organized and well presented. My only complaint is that the class was a little on the short side, and it could have went into more detail at a couple of points. I would still recommend the course, regardless of length (and have).",4
4766,This is a very interesting course looking at the rise of life on Earth and what that can teach us about how life may have emerged on other planets.,4
4772,"when i did this couse i spected to learn more about the bology of the virus, anyway i really enjoyed this course and i have learnt a lot!",4
4779,This class is filled with useful information and the outside resources it references are also great. The material in the class is presented in a clear and compassionate manner. It's a class worth taking to better understand AIDS/HIV and the role the disease plays throughout the world.,4
4784,"I did not watch every single video (I watched it initially for a school project so I had to cherrypick videos) but have definitely learnt so much from all the interviews that the professor has compiled for us and see from different aspects, e.g. political, legal, socio-economic factors, even literature, that have shaped our society's view on HIV patients.The professor has left very positive note and resonance for us to be aware of HIV and how to change our community by being aware of it. It is truly a meaningful course and I just want to give a huge thank you to University of Michigan for this MOOC.",4
4787,"It explored How HIV was diagnosed, what are all the actions taken Globally to combat pandemic.",4
4791,Very usefull course. Good explanation about the disease and actual course.,4
4793,"This interesting course focuses on the social and political aspects of this well-known virus. Interesting is as well the historical information provided and that different countries around the world are highlighted and how various presidents dealt with the epidemic. The focus on stigma is amazing, as this has a big influence on the disease. I would have preferred to have some more information about the bio-medical aspects of HIV to gain a complete understanding. However, I would definitely recommend this course to somebody that wants to create a more complete understanding of HIV/AIDS.",4
4801,"This course has been an useful approach for me to AIDS history.The point is focused on United States but also I Could learn something more of AIDS over the world.I was hoping to learn more over AIDS, and I did it. But also I learned over people. People who are HIV +, people who care and recent part of our history.",4
4807,"Interesting and well structured, easy to follow. Some videos were a bit too long, but the concepts were well explained. Everything was clean and clear. I enjoyed it.",4
4808,I really enjoyed this course. I have learnt a lot new things and upgraded on what I already knew. I recommend this to every one interested in understanding microbial resistance,4
4824,Difficult course for the beginner but if you put the work in you learn a tremendous amount of material.,4
4832,I greatly enjoyed the course.,4
4838,The course was very interesting and well-taught!,4
4844,I found this course to be very interesting and informing.,4
4855,very great course the variety in doctors every lesson is a very great thing but the assignment and asking about the names of bacteria is really hard and there is no enough data about why they are called that so it is really hard i hope you can add a lesson clarifing the names of bacteria,4
4856,"Efficient, relevant and well-formatted introduction to the topic! Great job!",4
4872,"This course is well fitted for clinicians, for scientists, i mean biologists, we can have a relevant matter too.",4
4873,Very informative. A lot of different experts. Nice and sometimes funny animations,4
4874,Good introduction to the medical side of bio-film studies.,4
4877,"Very nice course and digital support, could be a little more dynamic but very inf",4
4879,"The course was good, but there was a flaw in a fact that there were several lecturers. Some fact were repetitive, especially the interviews didn't bring anything new, and the tests sometimes were too specific. Anyway, I find the information given in this course extremely useful. The last module was the most exiting one, with clear structure and some really interesting themes to discover.",4
4883,"Bacteria are among the most import forms of life that ever existed, and to comprehend its biology is pivotal to human welfare and health. This course deliveries with flare high education from one of the most pretigious universities in Europe. I strongly recommend this increadibly interesting course to anyone who wants to learn about the fascinating world of biofilms and chronic infections.",4
4884,"Very detailed description of bacteria behavior. It gets very technical, but anyone curious about health with respect to bacteria's role can learn something from this course.",4
4885,"Very good context, yet the modules could be better distinguished.",4
4889,Very useful and scientific oriented,4
4891,"The content of this course is really interesting and intriguing, but it would better if there are additional sources and information. Also, instead of mainly picture the teacher in the video, it would be nice if there could be more graphics and diagrams to illustrate the idea that the professor is trying to convey. Besides those minor deficiencies, I would say that this is a really good course and will worth your time.",4
4905,I like the concept but I was expecting for more video lecture.,4
4925,Good content,4
4929,It would be better if the course can include more examples,4
4932,The lessons contain brief explanation even if this is an introduction study only. There are a lot of key things and terms to remember (that are mostly hard to comprehend if you do not have marketing knowledge) which I also believe are necessary in further B2B market study.PS. I like the funny introductions and side comments of Prof. Chang.,4
4949,"Can be extremely complicated with all of the unfamiliar names, and I'd lose focus. As a result, I had a hard time keeping up. I'd recommend pausing and returning another day if you lose focus.",4
4962,"excellent course would love to see more on early crocodilians and turtles, I know turtles have a debated history but would be awesome to look at possible origins.",4
4978,"A very interesting course, but it's a pity one can only do the quizzes after payment.",4
4979,It would be great if even the auditing students cool take the quizzes.,4
4989,Very well instructed and the videos are nice and short. Perfect as a side project or on the go learning.,4
4993,Really interesting material and well presented in digestible chunks by a pair of engaging professionals in the field.,4
5004,The content was good and very instructive but the videos and graphic material could be more dynamic and interactive.,4
5006,"Nice overview, gives a good appreciation for changes happening in the Arctic. Sometimes the lecture material is a bit dry and repetitive/slow.",4
5009,"I was really excited about this course. I thought the information was of high quality and well presented. However, I did have trouble staying focused. I would have liked more graphics depicting concepts. The presenter had a very monotone voice with a very active face. It was hard to sit through someone just talking at me even if the subject matter is interesting. I look forward to the other Arctic courses and hope they are just are well thought out but a bit more lively. You guys did a great job, keep it up!",4
5011,A very good review of the main topics related to the Arctic and climate change. Final lesson tests are sometimes confusing.,4
5015,"Very interesting course on the Arctic. As an introduction, I appreciated the broad overview of the things affecting the Arctic and thus the global climate. As a neophyte, some of the more technical, scientific aspects were hard to follow but were just as interesting to understand; having the course notes to go back to was helpful!",4
5016,"I found the course informative, but the quizzes to be a problem as there were too many multiple answers, so was near impossible to complete the quizzes correctly",4
5017,Very interesting course that covers the the Arctic and how it has been impacted by climate change. Overall a qualitative discussion of the Arctic climate that references more detailed quantitative data. The summary sheets for each week are a really helpful reference for the class and beyond.,4
5018,"Content was very good. I didn't liked the assignments, they were too short and the answering options were too narrow; sometimes they could be misinterpreted and led to a confusing missing point. I would recommend to add several more questions for each assignment, chosen random for each attempt, put a limit on total attempts and give feedback on answers. Thanks for the course, I enjoyed it a lot; short but precise.",4
5020,"really interesting, it's a really good base for all to understand the Arctic and a rebound to understand the climat change. I would like to learn more in the pdf lesson, if you'll be able to add some optional lessons to read I would appreciate, but for sur I'll take the next course. It well structure and explain. The other thing is about the test it will be interesting to have all the good answer after we've pass it. Just to understand our mistake",4
5022,"Good info. Instructor had rather odd body language, but friendly. Had trouble passing a couple of section tests due to ""check all that apply"" questions. Sections on ocean and atmosphere circulation and global warming rather boring and a little harder to follow. Interesting class overall.",4
5027,Cool,4
5039,"I had a really great time with this course. A lot of work went into it, from the presentation to the content. Really well done. It was quite challenging. I felt that the last module (7) introduced some very difficult concepts which, even after checking other sources, I couldn't understand fully. Some questions from the exam in that module were substantially different from the ones in the lectures. I would give 4.5 stars if I could.",4
5043,Was a useful course for people wanting to learn statistical concepts!,4
5050,thank you,4
5052,Nice and well done. Teachers are very clear in explaining concepts and examples are useful and helpful.,4
5055,"Very helpful for beginners, the examples are very well chosen to help you understand the meaning of all the mathematical formulas.",4
5063,Great introduction to statistics presented in a very interesting and engaging way.,4
5064,It's everything I needed to keep running with Data Scientist Specialization preparing.Thank you so much for your support!,4
5077,The course was great! It was quite dense and took a lot of time especially the R Lab sessions. Mr Loon may like to use more interesting ways for communication. Also the transcripts provided do not contain equations/ formulas which becomes a problem. Integrating slides into transcripts would be helpful.,4
5080,"I liked the course, nonetheless I liked we had previous exercises to prepare to each evaluation.",4
5085,"I liked the content of the course very much; the videos were all very clear, with nice examples & visualisations of those examples. However, the R labs included in this course were not very challenging; by following a list of steps you can complete them easily without learning much from them. Additionally, the R labs sometimes would not accept an answer as correct when it was a slightly different solution to the same problem.",4
5086,"Overall, very good course. I thought the weakest sections were the ones taught by Prof. Emiel van Loon (the dark-haired one). I found him much less clear and engaging than Prof. Matthijs Roduijn (the blonde one). The R labs were fine for me because I have a background in programming, but people without that may need a lot of time to do them.",4
5087,This course covers the basic knowledge of statistics and probability but skips the mathematical details behind the theory. Great for beginners but not perfect for advanced users.,4
5090,The course is quite informative and educative for a non-statistical person like me. The instructors were explaining complex concepts in a very simpler manner. Except that the use of data camp for R could have been replaced with the exercises done on R (offline) and submitted through the quiz. The quizzes were really good.,4
5095,"Love the lectures and the way everything is organized in the course, however the information or instructions provided by the labs seem incomplete.",4
5104,"Though it was mentioned that this course is for beginners without too much of statistics background, I still feel, some decent background is required to take up this course, particularly the Inference part.Otherwise, the course is pretty good and commendable.",4
5106,There should be some case study to feel real time scenario. As far as the content is concern its perfect.Thanks,4
5121,The explanations in the videos were very helpful. A very useful course.,4
5136,"Good course, although sometimes instructions/questions are unclear",4
5139,Very useful Statistics Course.,4
5151,Great course :),4
5157,Nice. For noobs.I enjoyed it!,4
5170,"Very nice and useful course, some small mistakes in R assignments",4
5173,"The course is really good.i was little bit familiar with statistics but after this course everything became clear in my mind and don,t have any confusion also .",4
5174,"I really liked the course, it was relatively easy to understand and enjoyable, and specially the lessons taught by Matthijs, he was just amazing at making it all very understandable and enjoyable. And overall, I just really feel some exercises along the way for each topic would have been of great help.",4
5178,Excellent course and well taught by both instructors. 4 stars because of the lack of feedback on quizzes and exam.,4
5180,"Lovely accent, great lecture for the younger teacher. The older teacher really confuses me sometimes cos the language he used was very academic and hard to understand, besides he has a tendency to read other than lecture",4
5185,"Great class, but I wish there were more practice problems. Statistics is a very important concept to learn for any field, and I highly recommend this class.",4
5194,I would give five stars BUTI wish that it isn't a must to finish R program.,4
5202,I enjoyed the class.,4
5209,"This course has given me a much better understanding of many concepts I never understood while studying at university - Like the sampling distribution etc. and I can recommend it...The only ""but"" is... I can see from the discussions that some (many?) students have problems with the ""R"" assignments. I have been programming previously, so I have not have had these problems. I would though like that these ""R"" assignments where easier to print or collect in a PDF document, so that I could easily use it as a ""howto"" later.",4
5210,"Good course, but it seems there are some errors in the quiz and labs",4
5212,I really enjoyed attending this course and recommended it to my colleagues and friends who want to learn basic statistics. They have tried their best to make it more intuitive with some interesting examples and make the learning somewhat fun. kudos to the entire team!,4
5225,"Despite some error in the quizzes I learned quite a lot by taking this online course. Apparently the course organisers are overwhelmed by its success, since they react (too) slowly to comments made by students in the discussion fora. At least, errors should be tackled immediately.",4
5227,Most of the parts were interesting and clear... some cumbersome and slow pace with the other professor. Not sure if the diapers and shit-painting were the best examples.,4
5231,Good course to polish up your statistics knowledge.,4
5243,"Overall, a great course that provides the basics of statistics in a thorough and intuitive way, plus a taste and feel of the software R. Of special note are the amazing visualizations in the presentations! There are some typoes and errors in the course material though, which is a shame, as everything else is excellent.",4
5245,"In my opinion this course is a good way to learn basic statistics. I do think the R part and the statistics part could be more integrated in order to learn R better and to use it more efficiently. For me the studytime was double the time that was stated even though I was already familiar with some of the concepts and calculations. I feel like some weeks the subjects should have gotten a little more explanation with video's or other supportive material, maybe some assigments to make in order to check wether you know and understand the material. Maybe you could compare content and way of teaching to the Duke University statistics course, this is not a better course per se but does do some things differently whilst both teaching stats and R.",4
5252,Course is really well made foe beginners in statistics. This is relevant.,4
5253,"So far a very nice course, well explained and clear enough to be followed even by non mathematicians. Well done!",4
5258,"Good to get the intuition behind the theory, but it is a high level course.",4
5259,It's wonderful how teacher have broken down each and every concept. Examples helps in clearing the concept well.,4
5265,Very good explainations with plenty of examples,4
5332,"Course was excellent. Prof. was excellent. I am a retired nurse so I took the course because of my lifelong interest in astronomy, science and the unknown. My only complaint is that I could not complete the last quiz because I could not get the micro-observatory to work on my Mac OS. My husband is a computer engineer and he could not get it to work on his computer either. This was disappointing!",4
5333,Very nice. Something to improve: mix quizes with videos and not all videos first and then the quizes,4
5341,Good and clear explanations. At the end it became more difficult since filosophie was involved which for me opened my ey. Some 'slides' are old fashioned.,4
5351,Good one. Detailed.Too much of video clips from television etc. Can avoid those.,4
5358,I took the survey and hopefully I can continue with this course because I enjoy learning about Astronomy .I've taken other courses and hope that I can continue doing this . I have problems with my computer andtrying to understand the format but I will do my best because I do like to learn more about this subject.,4
5362,It is a very informative and systematically planned course.,4
5370,"it's give the knowledge, make me better",4
5394,This course is the second couresera course which completed. It is always nice to learn from people who do frontier work in the field they teach. I thank coursera for giving me this wonderful opportunity. Sakthivel,4
5405,Good course inviting the scientific thought process to evolve instead of believing the old stories.,4
5408,"The contents of the course are great and prof. Impey is a great communicator. The course is easy to follow, the final chapters on galaxies and cosmology are a bit more difficult but that is due to the nature of the subject and I applaud that the prof does not ""dumb it down"" or brushes over such difficult ans speculative subjects. I minor nuisance for me were the frequent songs and funny videos interspersed in the course content. It would have been better if they were separate from the main videos or otherwise could be easily skipped by people who don't have a lot of time. overall a great course!",4
5430,Good explanations about the topics.,4
5433,"Overall this course was great but I wish that the timeline was a little clearer from the get-go. I had to rush at the end because I didn't realize week 2 was for finding sources, week 3 was for contacting them, week 4 was for interviews, etc...If the MSU staff could have given their feedback on our final projects, that would have been another plus, but I know it's difficult with so many students.",4
5435,"Thank you for sharing us the guidance for creating the Capstone Project, the final Course under Specialization - Journalism, Report the News!Enjoyed it very much, also the time spent to review my peers objectively as much as I enjoyed reading their reviews.Is there going to be other related writing studies from MSU through Coursera?Best Regards,Monika Pandiangan (Monik)",4
5437,"I learned a lot but I felt that the final project was significantly more difficult than the work leading up to it, and there was no support I could find or access via the class itself.",4
5440,"Good Course, but it needs more focus on ContentProviders and Services.",4
5441,Moves too fast,4
5443,"Like part 1 this course is very informative for anyone new to android development. Pacing is good. The assignments are well developed and clear, although I found one to be on the really tricky side. Good course.",4
5445,I think the exercises could be more deep.,4
5450,Good content but sometimes it gets confusing.,4
5460,"Theis course is substantially more difficult than the three first ones, and the material is scarce. However, I must admit that this is one of the courses I have ever learnt the most",4
5461,Bayesian stats is a broad topic. Learners would benefit from more material.,4
5464,"The material is good. However, there is no support from the instructors to answer our questions in the discussion forum.",4
5480,"I had a lot of fun during this course, but I think it is simply too short to present all the topics in sufficient detail. Furthermore, I took this course without doing the prior courses in the specialization, and there were a couple of moments when I really thought previous knowledge from a different course was required.I think for the most part the lecturers did a great job in explaining the materials in the course. The lectures themselves were also well structured, and the topics followed each other in a logical order. I would have loved to spend more time on modeling techniques and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.",4
5483,"I hope we can have access to the slides, and this can save attendees a lot of time, because I think after we finished watching the video we can skip relevant slides when we come across problems in doing exercise.",4
5488,"The section about Beta-Binomial Conjugate is taught very fast and unless the student is quite familiar with Beta and Gamma distributions, it makes it very difficult to follow the course.",4
5496,Great course !!! Lot's of interesting information.,4
5506,Good course for quick understaniding of the basics for negotiation. also helpfull to go over before upcoming negotiation.,4
5508,good all to gather but looking for more interesting skills,4
5509,Very informative for expanding my skills and terminology.,4
5510,Very clear c,4
5519,The course is mostly theoretical,4
5520,Good resources and material for self study. The Guest separe was very interesting.,4
5528,Very good. Could use more on soft skills.,4
5534,Good Course. Topics are well explained.,4
5537,"enjoyed this, as well as finding out I dont know as much as what I thought i did",4
5538,This course has a lots of knownledge and well-structured contents.,4
5545,Very good points. Logical and concisely presented. Will definitely influence the way that I approach a negotiation. Particularly like the idea that both parties need to come away satisfied with the outcome.,4
5548,"Useful Course, very informative.",4
5550,Totally worth taking this course if you intend to improve your negotiation skills from simply haggling and bargaining to true win-win agreements.,4
5554,"Great course! Summarized the experiences I had on actual negotiation. Also provided good tips, hint and resources for further study to improve my negotiation skills.",4
5556,Very informative and easy to understand instructor.,4
5558,"Best short and brief video as well as presentations.It helped me lot to learn new styles and approches towards ""negotiations"" which is part of daily life these days.Thanks to the team and Coursera.",4
5562,"succinct, down-to-earth and focused on the essentials - just what I wanted and got! However, certainly no substitute for a negotiation course e.g. as part of an MBA. Overall a bit colourless.",4
5563,negotiation is a key part in my work so the insights and skills are urgently needed for this. This course is very logical and useful.,4
5571,Missing examples,4
5574,"Clear explanations, useful word problems and well designed quices.",4
5579,The teacher is boring but he conveys all information clearly.,4
5580,"Very nice, I would have liked to go deeper in NGS and RNA seq but is good as starter, I recommend it!",4
5583,It is a very nice course for beginners. I learnt a lot from it. Thank you!,4
5585,"Nice course, useful to know the most common tools used to do Bioinformatics",4
5593,"A short and sweet, to-the-point course. This course helped me in getting a hang of some of the most widely used softwares and techniques required for bioinformatics. Only issue-some of the questions in certain quizzes have been assigned wrong choices as the answer, which led to a lot of confusion. They just wouldnt accept the right answer, so you are forced to mark the wrong ones and proceed.",4
5595,Very good starting point or restarting point for working with sequence data as a compuational biologist. Very clear course with good lab sessions.,4
5601,A very interesting course and a great starting point towards bioinformatics,4
5622,"On the theoretical side, this is a very good introduction, and clearly a lot of effort has been poured into the practical part - only for that, the Toronto team deserves a lot of credit. Sadly, it suffers from the same problem as nearly every intro course in bioinformatics: the labs are merely a set of instructions to follow... even the very last. Still, if you never heard of BLAST or how to draw a phylogenetic tree, this is the course to do.",4
5625,enjoying it and its helping alot in my unit,4
5631,Excellent material and explained well by the professor!,4
5633,There was a lot of stuff I could immediately use for my work. some of the other stuff was good to know to better understand what can be done behind the scene.,4
5635,A thorough course for beginners with very interesting labs! I was pleasantly surprised with how much and how easily I learned bioinformatics skills with this course. Well done!,4
5639,"A good, interesting and attractive introduction to Bioinformatic methods. Professor Provart is able to make thing easy, whilst showing you how to exploit data and tools freely - well ... usually, they are for free - available on the Internet.I suggest this course to everyone approaching the topic. Personally, I will also take Bioinformatic Method II to be initiated to elements of structural Bioinformatic methods.The 5th star is missing because I would like to have some more insights about some underlying ""reasons why"". But, I reckon this as my own peculiarity.Good job, Professor Provart! And thank you very much for this!",4
5641,"As a biochemist, it is a nice refresher for me !",4
5664,"i will thanks to management, i really need to learn this course because my FYP is based on this course",4
5669,Extremely interesting but could be more detailed showing more specific data and examples with downloadable spreadsheets.,4
5674,Gives an in-depth explanation about how intents and broadcast receivers work in android.,4
5676,"A lot of information to be absorbed.I like how up-to-date the material is, though in some cases a a little too 'fresh'---assignments need some clean-up.For the app case studies and assignments, should add simple UML sequence and/or collaboration diagrams to the existing class diagrams.This would help to better illustrate the interactions of the various Android classes---especially if it could be animated.",4
5682,I really liked the course. I would have preferred to have been forced to do the optional assignment as it takes that little bit of extra motivation coming up to Christmas to do these optional assignments. I still plan to do them but being forced to do them to get a pass would help.Otherwise I really like what I learning and how its presented. Just need to use it somehow to get a job!,4
5684,Very helpful! requires strong coding skills.,4
5686,"Very good and high level course. The reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is coz this course uses two topics both of which were not covered in Java for Android Course : Java Concurrency/Threads and Java 8 lambda expressions. So I had to take a side route to learn these topics. Also if the programming assignments could be made non-optional and auto graded, that would be great.",4
5694,I found it a bit peculiar that there were no tasks (problem sets) that were actually required to be taken (and passed obviously) to receive this course's certificate - which kind of devalues the obtainment of such in my opinion as passing the course by taking quizzes only seems a bit easy to me. Also the whole presentation of the material seemed not as thoroughly thought through - compared to other moocs I have taken or even the first course of this specialization. Although I must admit once you totally got around the fact that this mooc relies heavily on supplementary learning material (I for one bought the ebook mentioned in the course - the busy coder's guide to android development - which is an excellent book and I probably would not have found out about without this mooc) and one gets used to it's approach it is not as bad. Altogether I have to say the course was no waste of my time since I certainly did learn a lot but it could use some honing on a few sides. On an absolute positive side I feel the urge to mention the case studies conclusively which were really eye opening if analysed alongside the mentioned ebook and doing some googling :) Looking forward to course number 3 of this specialization.,4
5695,It was I nice course but it would have been better start building an app from scratch in the practice sections,4
5702,"Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor. The peer assignments don't work well compared to other Coursera courses. I submitted my assignments in time, but even after a month I still don't have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the 'completion' of my course. When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses?! In addition, you can't participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself. I would prefer to add to a thread than go in blind to each forum",4
5715,Not well explained. Do read the resources and spend time on YouTube and stack overflow to understand the concepts. Otherwise definetly a challenge and an interesting course,4
5716,"The only, issue: we does not have the data set to validate our code.",4
5724,very good organized course,4
5727,"Great exercises. My only complaint is the last 2 weeks, the instructors weren't visual enough. They kept using hand gestures and not enough concrete visualizations of some of the steps. There were a lot of concrete visualizations for the big ideas... but not enough for all the different material and intermediary steps they were trying to teach.",4
5741,"Great course to follow along, I love how the homework assignments have the input template already in place so you can focus on the algorithm",4
5746,"I liked the course - it has very good balance, with some challenging tasks, but not too hard for smart learner. Good job! Getting 100% grade was fun.On other side minimal passing grade is a joke. You can literally get the certificate simply by implementing given pseudo-code in language of your choice. It hugely devalues the certificate, especially so without Honor track and no ""with distinction"" certificate offered.",4
5747,Course covers most of the classic algorithms problems. There should have been final exam.,4
5748,"The course was awesome ..The content ,the problems were all thought provoking - couple of times i had issues understanding the language of the instructor , sans that it is a very very good course and a must take i would say",4
5756,"Very Good courseAll the concepts were explained very well, barring Dynamic Programming. That could have been a bit more detailed. The programming assignments were fun to solve. A must have course for people beginning their study in computer science.",4
5760,Really nice experience for me . I enjoyed it,4
5764,everything is great exept last week,4
5769,Pretty informative and helps you refresh the basics.,4
5770,Very good course! But expensive.,4
5772,"Lectures and quizzes are okay, assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics. I have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs. However, I do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasks.Programming assignments aren't really friendly to Haskell's list, and vectors are not available. If you use Haskell, you'll be forced to work with arrays or sequences, which are not as nice.",4
5775,"The course content is very good and is must have if you missed that stuff in colledge. It teaches of algorithmic analysis so you know which algorithm is more efficient, gives some examples of cool techniques and provides challenges to apply those techniques.However, there are things that I hate about this course. First of all this is about forums. They are broken down into sessions and there are too little people on each session. Staff provides exactly zero help. If you are stuck, you have no hope on these forums and will need to find help somewhere else.Programming assignments are great, they are relevant, interesting, challenging and the automatic grader system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm. There have been some problems in divide and conquer section though. I've been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. I've written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automated tests, posted on course forums (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by switching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger,Some lecturers have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting. It is not a lot of work to take some English pronunciation training before making a course, isn't it?Overall, I enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with. Now I am glad I did that because now I am not sure about buying the other courses and will look somewhere else first.Anyway, the creators of the course have done a great job, which is highly appreciated. I believe you can make this course much better by fixing the issues I pointed above.",4
5778,"Very good course. It illustrates many algorithms using simple ways, short videos and readable material.",4
5786,"Nice and tough course. Make sure to plan ahead for the homework if you expect to complete all of the assignments above and beyond what is required. After finishing the course I switched my session to the next one so that I would be able to complete all the extra assignments. It can be tough juggling this class if you work full time, and have other projects outside of work that demand your time.",4
5787,"Great course. I would suggest to improve pronunciation of some of the lecturers, add more material, lower the concentration of the material (by prolonging or splitting the course). Great work, thanks!",4
5790,it was a really good course..i had learned a lot from this course.:),4
5796,"Very good and challenging course. Gets tougher as it progresses. Less support from the staff and the community, but proper content and explanation in the videos.",4
5797,"I think that some assignations are too difficult, and some indeed few explanations are poor",4
5800,The overall course was very good however the edit distance lectures were very fast to grasp the concepts,4
5819,"Alexander Kulikov, Michel Levin and Neil Rhodes are awesome teachers. Every topic of this course opens a whole new dimension of concept. It was awesome.",4
5821,"Great course, however some assignment are really difficult and the forum seems not very helpful.",4
5822,Programming assignments are well structured in such a way that it encourages one to continuously improve upon the solution.,4
5826,"Explanation could have been more clear, especially for polynomial multiplication.",4
5835,The course is great,4
5840,"I like the course structure and material. It starts off easy enough to get you interested and then throws at you challenges at early stage, if you are up for it.What I don't like is video session itself, some of instructors talk too fast and dwell much into topic, assuming you understood everything. And as way to composite that, they offer a ""resource"" links to help you understand.Then some of them have ""hard"" accent, it's really difficult to follow them even for native speaker, yet alone for those whose English is second language.Now exercise and assignments are spot on but you are forced to relay on other sources to grasp everything. I doubt anyone taking this course has not reached for ""outer"" help at least once.",4
5843,"The accent from teachers would be a little bit annoying, also the fact that most of the topics (incomes, outcomes from the programs) are unclear for a naive student. But for the rest, is a great way to introduce programming.",4
5846,"Good collection of task and learning materials. Definitely worth it! More numbers theory and algorithms reading could be included. But agree, it better to read books referenced.Thank you!",4
5847,Overall this was a good course. Some of the presenters need to work on their presentation skills (personally I had no problems with the accents). I also felt that the sections on dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed and I needed to spend a bit of time researching this on third parties before I felt comfortable completing the exercises.The grading system was really cool and the exercises seemed well thought-out and thorough. I'd recommend this course to existing developers without a computer science background. Those who want more mathematical rigour should look into the Tim Roughgarden/Stanford course.,4
5852,"I found the course to have some really helpful approaches to solving algorithmic problems when test inputs are unknown. Great ""Toolbox"" for a programmer.",4
5855,"To complete this course you should be familiar with programming. While the first weeks are relatively easy to follow, last ones are really hard to keep up with.",4
5856,"Overall I like this course. The beginning of the course was very light and easy to follow. As the concepts got more in-depth, the weeks (namely 4 and 5) felt rushed and somewhat incomplete. Regardless, having never been exposed to this type of material, and for the price, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get their feet wet with algorithms.",4
5861,I learned a lot in this course and it was sufficiently challenging. My only qualm was that some of the pseudo-code was hard to understand and slightly misleading.,4
5867,An excellent and methodical approach to learning algorithms and their related data structures (as well as appreciating the value and importance of efficient computing). Also a great refresher even if you have had formal training in Data Structures and Algorithms.,4
5868,"Near the end it becomes a slosh to get through all the information covered in the last two weeks. It feels like you are given some hints and pointers on what to do, but for the most part, the last two weeks are being tossed in the deep end and hoping you learn how to swim.I want to give a 3.5 but that's not allowed. With the amount of content covered this course is closer to a 4 than a 3.",4
5873,"It is a brilliant course, well organized and pretty interesting. However, the problems are not as challenging as one could expect.",4
5876,"As the title suggests, this course will give you some tools/techniques in terms of algorithms design and implementation. You will probably also learn from doing the programming assignments. Enjoy!",4
5879,"The course gives a good overview on the algorithms types and problems, but it's cannot be used as standalone source of algorith,s learning. You should use good textbook as well.The programming challenges are really interesting (and challenging), sometimes it took for me a couple of evenings to complete all five week assignments.Thanks!",4
5880,"The content covered in this course is great. However, I hope there was a more efficient way to communicate with student. I hope there is a way to bring student together like a group chat function in the coursera app. So, people who want to be more committed can communicate more often and effcient.",4
5888,lots of mathematics and it's challenging,4
5889,"The dynamic programming classes could be really improved, but, overall, a solid course.",4
5890,"Everything is awesome except a minor mismatch between Niel Rhodes's and Alexander Kulikov's presentations in Week 4. Although Prof. Rhodes prooved Master Theorem in the first half of the Week, Prof. Kulikov didn't use it estimating algorithms asymtotics.",4
5893,"The course material is very good indeed, but some of the instructors were somewhat difficult to understand because of strong accents. Subtitles were largely inaccurate.",4
5894,"Once they dig into the material, the difficulty ramps up, and it's absolutely worth it!",4
5895,The full course should be available with the assignments for the non payers. Only the certificate of this should be provided to those who have paid.,4
5896,Dynamic Programming need to be stronger,4
5898,"Really challenging, starts easy but gets heavy and time consuming after 3rd week.Be prepared to study additional material and spend some hours cracking the weekly assignments. Satisfying when you accomplish it. Maybe a good idea could be to combine algorithms and data structures and separate in 2 courses Algo & Data Structures 1, and Algo & DS 2.I feel, a better knowledge of DS could have help me to solve the Algo assignements faster.",4
5902,"very well designed course ,very helpful.",4
5914,Great course. I enjoy it.,4
5916,"First four weeks of the course were awesome,some exciting problems,insightful teaching but fifth week's content I felt were not up to the standards of first four weeks.Nonetheless it was great experience.Thank you instructors and course forum.",4
5927,Great assignments -- Keep up the good work guys!,4
5932,nice stress testing is now i am learned,4
5938,"Testing cases are claimed to be generated randomly, in that way why can't we get the random test case to improve our result? Also, there is no example code after the course, if I didn't solve out the problem I may never have the chance to work it out.",4
5943,More information should be given for the failed test cases. Is a waste of time to find bug if you don't know what the bug is. ie test case 4/13 in the minimal dot product assignment,4
5952,It is a great course. But explanation could be made simpler in proof part of the course.,4
5959,"Videos are very well explained, the exercises comes with several difficulties, good to apply what you learn and push a bit more. I was able to retake some stuff that I've forgotten and learn new stuff. As a 12 year experienced engineer, I'm please that I took this course.",4
5963,"the content if very good, but lecturers are terrible. you better read slides and read any book you like. watching their videos it wast of time.",4
5966,Good course.But I wish there was a final assignment which covered all the weeks like a module exam to revise what we have learnt in all 4 weeks,4
5971,"Lectures were clear, for the most part, and the homeworks were fun and instructive. Material on dynamic programming might have been clearer. Also, notes and references to texts would have been helpful. Thanks for putting together a great course.",4
5972,"Very instructive and informative, helps resolving many doubts.Excellent examples and programming assignments, information provided by autograder is just about right.I feel like the programming assignment is just a tad too relaxing, for dynamic programming for example, I think we need to complete 3 out of 5 in order to pass, not just two.",4
5974,Good. Waiting for session to began.,4
5975,"Having time left on the last programming assignment in week 4 and not being allowed to complete it was a downer. I'm not sure if this was bug or if I'm missing something. The course was great and challenging. Thank you for preparing, organizing and teaching this course.",4
5976,"This is an awesome Course. I'd like that the failed tests, of the submitted programs, to be shown, in order to have a better idea where you are doing wrong.",4
5977,"I really think this is a good course, but some of them is hard to understand for me as beginner.",4
5991,"good course with some very nice idea. I like the fact you can use a lot of languages for you programming assesment, the content is really helpful, I would like to have more indications from the grading system to save time.",4
5995,A very good course on Algorithms.,4
5999,An excellent starting point to get into a popular method of building viable business models. Good value!,4
6007,great presentation,4
6010,Great approach and Canevas,4
6014,"Some times the videos aren´t in a logical sync with the upcoming activity, or the content from the video is somewhat vague and then not clearly explained in the class.",4
6018,good explaination,4
6022,"Other than a few technical glicthes with the videos in both firefox and chrome browsers, this is a very good course. I learned to use a great visual tool for developing my business model. I would have liked to have joined in the discussions and tasks but, I think coursera is charging too much for this course.",4
6028,It's very good the way to describe the diferent segments to build your own business model and to give s better structure to your business idea. I'm giving 4 stars because the only way to complete the course or to interact with it is by paying the full certificate. But besides this fact it is very complete.,4
6041,"A good introductory course to AR. In some parts of the course, the lectures go over the code for an extended period of time jumping across different lines of code and it is quite hard to keep track of this. Thankfully, the transcript helps. However, it would be better to explain the code in templates or another way which makes it easier to learn. Overall, this course is definitely recommended to understand the basics of AR.",4
6052,It was very intuitive course with lots of example and explanation.,4
6057,Interesting concepts here and loved seeing all the connections. At times it was a bit too cutesy in its presentations.,4
6058,"A really well structured course filled with rich knowledge and important details. On completion of this course, the meaning of the word 'History' won't be the same again.",4
6062,"Very nice course, only minor issue is that the assignments were a tad easy",4
6063,"Good course to show that the sum total of what the Earth is today and what she is capable of is truly the sum of everything that has had an effect on the Earth since the Big Bang. Had the environment been off slightly in heat, H2O, O2, etc., the right elements had not been present, there had been not liquid water, no lightning, etc., there may not have formed life on the planet and Earth might be more like Mars.",4
6066,Covers a lot of fields of knowledge. Beautifully illustrated and well explained.,4
6075,An excellent course indeed! Strongly recommended for 'everyone'!,4
6100,"Just started this course, but so far love the graphics and the enthusiasm of the teachers.",4
6107,"Ambitious coverage of the human understanding of our reality to date. Gaps in knowledge are left for future finding, while the presentation of what we do know with some certainty is highlighted. The 4th lesson video of week 1 is a masterpiece.",4
6109,Very interesting and mind expanding.,4
6116,Great ideas. Great course.,4
6121,It is very good but it doesn't explain every thing,4
6124,"This is a good course. I liked the idea of the 9 thresholds of increasing complexity, with the energy required, the Goldilocks conditions, and emergence. I want to think about this a bit more, and see how I can apply it to other, smaller, thresholds.I like the idea of restoring the idea of a story to history. It's time to think about whether we should be moving into the driver's seat, and whether we have any idea of where we want to go.What would it take to make this a great course? The Discussion Forums don't seem to sparkle the way they do with some other courses I have done. I have completed other Coursera offerings, such as Origins (University of Copenhagen Natural History Museum), Our Earth (Climate, History, and Processes - University of Manchester), and Introduction to Genetics & Evolution (Duke University), and there was a lot of discussion among students. I felt that I learned a lot from the discussions, and not just the formal lectures. I also noticed the lecturers participating in the discussions. I cannot understand why this hasn't happened on this course, but it is part of my feeling that this course has a way to go yet.",4
6131,"Enjoyable course and I appreciated the interdisciplinary nature. At times, I felt like I wanted to delve deeper into the content, but I understand that this MOOC, like most others, are breadth courses designed for incoming Freshmen.",4
6140,The course content had met its objectives. I loved the way interdisciplinary sciences were explained precisely from Astronomy to paleontology to economics,4
6151,"Good, engaging and thought-provoking course.",4
6153,Initial reaction: Superb……Lectures are succinct and understandable. Support material seems well selected and informative. Forums are lively and peopled by very interested students……Towards the end of the course however I began to wonder about the efficacy of some of the claims and I had a growing doubt about much of the material used…...,4
6158,"The course is very nicely done and well organized. The fundamental organization around sources of learning and the progression of lessons are well done and strongly support knowledge building. Some of the speakers have verbal patterns or flows of speaking that can be a bit distracting, but they are all interesting and informative. I like that you can also download transcripts. I am a very visual learner whose mind tends to wander off when faced with a talking head. Having the transcript to follow as I listen allowed me to highlight and make notes while listening, ensuring greater attention to the content. Ultimately, I made the decision to not finish the course. Not because the course was not well done but because it doesn't align with my own interests in systems thinking and complexity. It is a good course and well worth engaging in, even if you discover, as I did, that it doesn't quite match one's learning needs. I do recommend it if you are interested in cosmology and theories related to the origins of the universe.",4
6163,This Astronomy course is good but for people that are more interesting in the big bang theory and how the universe came into existence today.,4
6168,"the last assignment is too time consuming, I didn't completed it though I finished all the other assignments.",4
6172,"Very nice overview, but it seemed to be too much information for the limited time. There should be a separate six week course for each threshold.",4
6185,"A logical expansion of the way history should be taught, Big History starts with the Big Bang and moves on from there. The historical information is not new but the perspective it encourages provides a way to tie history closer to science and the major events that have changed the universe, our world and human life. To often in history we get caught up in the details. Big History makes sure that the big picture, and how we fit into it, is always visible.",4
6191,Tricky concepts explained in a good and practicle way... But you will have to spend much time by reading and analyzing examples and solving optional exercises... And reviewing past Moocs to extract all date from this mooc.,4
6195,Need little change or update. But very good explanation!,4
6198,challenging,4
6201,"Lots of good data. Really a walk through of coding without too much theory. Would prefer a little more theory. Would have helped in completing the course and capstone. Ended up having to take Eric Lander Intro to Bio course on edx to really understand what I had done. In particular, a better explanation of what is going on at a basic with methylation marks and how the Epigenome Map was constructed.",4
6204,"The course is hard and needs previous knowledge of R. The time for for doing the ""quizes"" are not long. On the other hand, the questions resemble real world bioinformatics problems. The real inconvenience with this course is that the Forum does not work. Because not all that is questioned in the ""quizes"" are thought in the classes. So a help from the Forum is a real need for this course to work smoothly.",4
6205,The course is tough and needs lots of practice and time to handle the stuff explained in this course. In my opinion the stuff should be split into 2 courses (partA and partB) with detailed explanation of every covered topic.,4
6206,A nice course to introduce Bioconductor to students,4
6207,I think it is a good class overall but the pace is fast and the resources that can help you is lacking. This will be good for someone who already kind of understands bioconductor.,4
6216,"Four stars because the content is good. Not five stars because the english is not so good and for a non-english expert it can be difficult to understand, and the subtitle contains quite often errors.",4
6227,The problem sets are like real life problems and the lecture focuses on what are the most confusing parts. It is a valuable course for someone who has just a little computer programming background to start one's journey with C language.,4
6229,"Excellent content. The instructors are very thorough in their explainations. The only fault I see is that there isn't many students doing the course, and such it is hard to get help, especially if your schedule is tight and you can only do online courses on Saturday and Sunday. Looking forward to taking the Advance course though.",4
6233,Good Assignments.,4
6236,"A very interesting course ! Serious and much developed work. Nice special interactive lessons (though speaking english is necessary to understand them), important to get deeper information about some themes. This course is very useful, to be able to evaluate animals welfare through their behaviour, and then to improve it with suitable ways. I just wish there would be more concrete examples of enrichment for wild animals in captivity... I hope this course will be used by more and more people in the world. Our animal friends need it ! Thank you ! Cours très intéressant, et développé. Les leçons interactives apportent des infos complémentaires bienvenues sur quelques thèmes (mais il faut pouvoir lire l'anglais...). Cours très utile pour apprendre à évaluer le bien-être d'un animal grâce à son comportement, et pour pouvoir l'améliorer par des moyens appropriés...",4
6251,i have many new idea about how we should manage the enclosure and breeding management,4
6263,"I really enjoyed the perspective and things I learned. I thought I could have scored higher on the quizzes because I was saying the same thing as them, but just in a different way. I would recommend this course.",4
6274,"Very interesting and easy going apart of the informal and scientific based lectures. I enjoy it a lot!!100% recommended not only for thoose who have a pet dog, but for all of us to understand better our four legged friends who live and a pat of human soceity!!! :))))Well Done!!",4
6281,Very good understandable !,4
6284,"This course is great for anyone who is doing animal healthcare or any related field. It gives good principles of what is proper welfare and also the issues of negative or debative welfare. They also talk about how welfare is applied in certain countries to give realistic perspectives and thought of how the world conducts it's business in the world of animal livestock farming, or wildlife captivity. It's a real eye opener and I'd recommend people who are just generally animal lovers, professional or not, to take this course. I absolutely enjoyed it and learned new things from it!",4
6291,It's fun and understandable,4
6299,"Great course!! If you are interested in animal welfare particularly animal welfare in animals produced for food, this is a very good course with lots of resources.",4
6304,"This was a really cool, fun course, and I learned a LOT, but I was hoping that they would talk more about the animals in captivity, and major issues relating to them. Other than that, it was an interesting topic to learn about!",4
6309,"There are a few disturbing images, but otherwise it's okay.",4
6315,"It's great, i recommend it.",4
6318,"Interesting, thank you for making this course available. After taking it I transitioned from being pescetarian to vegan and I wish that more controversial animal rights concerns were more focused on.",4
6326,"Great instructors and good information. I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in aspects of animal welfare across the board, but especially for someone who is considering getting their first pet. The concepts are explained well, and easy to understand.",4
6330,It would be perfect if within the learning material is included in PDF files. The content is wonderful,4
6343,Great.!!! But if the content would be more. I find it unfair for a topic of such importance to be given so less attention. People will also respect it if the content would be more than it is right now...!!,4
6344,Course was very informative. It also had many amazing resources!,4
6346,good to have a knowledge about the animal welfare and their needs,4
6350,A good way to get your feet wet on the topic of animal behaviour and welfare!,4
6351,Nice overview into animal behaviour and welfare with enough examples to make it easy to understand.,4
6362,"Good course to improve your Portuguese skills: there are both audio, video and texts. You learn some stuff about Brazil too but there is too much talking about identity, which is very abstract. I wish there were more podcasts as for Week 5, which was the most interesting one. Thank you to the teachers for this interesting course :)",4
6366,I really learned things from this coarse which I would not learn it easily from life .,4
6381,Excellent insight in case you want to become a veterinarian!,4
6382,"It was a very informative course with a wide variety of videos and additional resources. The only downside, however, was that in some review quizzes (particularly the one for week 5) there were a few questions on subjects that weren't covered in either the videos or the additional resources provided.",4
6387,"The knowledge share is really good, thought provoking as well as precise and straight to the point. Although, it is very basic, it refreshes your minds on veterinary practice and new things are learnt.",4
6388,"The only thing stopping me from rating 5 stars is that there are questions on the quizzes that are not covered in the lectures or supplementary material. So be sure to have your Google window open and ready during the quiz.Otherwise, I love the course and am happy to give it a 4 star rating for the quality of the lectures.",4
6391,So great but I found the last module about history of veterinary medicine overly long and boring,4
6414,"Great course; very informative, highly educational, fascinating... There were just two things I didn't like about the professor, though I liked HER a lot; she was very welcoming, hospitable, and amicable; she treated her students well, and was enthusiastic about teaching us. That is a trait I have seen for the first time on Coursera, and I have to give Dr. Chagpar high praise in these terms. The only things I did not like - which are very small in contrast to the things I did like - were that she taught a bit as though she was teaching to 6th graders, rather than seasoned adults. But that is not much of an issue. My only other complaint is that she seemed quite callous towards women suffering - even dying - from breast cancer. But I suppose breast surgeons come to distance themselves from these terrible, tragic events.",4
6422,Very good information. Thank y,4
6427,"Good course, great instructor.",4
6439,the way of introduction is quit helpful to see speaker and lecture,4
6440,"I really like the subject of the course. The presentation was really good. However, some of the concepts were not so easy to understand. The course does not provide any reading, so I had to watch the lectures again if I forget some of the details. Eventually I've started taking detailed notes and added screenshots to my notebook. I wish I could have more exercises just for practice that would not be graded. That would provide a safe env. to learn and practice before taking final tests. Some of the answers to exercises were very helpful to learn the concepts better. So, more such practical exercises would be helpful.",4
6450,"I enjoyed this course. It was quite informative and good in introducing some concepts for me like the QA/QC/QM topic that I was not very familiar with. A good follow-up would be to present a course on how to build laboratory capacity in this area for countries wanting to get better at AST. I would also suggest that some of the presentations be shortened particularly those which will be presented in much more detail later to avoid the doubling up of information eg like the section on methods were covered almost twice for some material. Also, I would like to suggest use of practical examples when trying to explain these concepts. I thought you presented them well but for better understanding, use practical case study examples showing how you handle the situation in the lab. For example, provide us with when these methods are applied so they are not just random.Thank you for this course and I look forward to your follow-up course.",4
6452,"Overall, the course contents is useful. If course slides can be provided, that'll be extra helpful.",4
6456,"Good course, gives a good notion of the basics. Very technical (as in it emphasizes more the technical part of antimicrobial testing) and basic (in the theoretical part). I'm an MD student, currently on my final year. The course brought up new aspects to the antibiogram that I was oblivious about, something that I think is very important for the modern-age physician.",4
6457,Muy instructivo,4
6461,This class was very much eye-opening as I have gained knowledge and experience,4
6462,"I did like to course very much. However, the in the last video, although the lecturer tried to speak clearly, I didn't understand all things very well.",4
6464,very good and useful,4
6472,"It was a really good course, but I think there´s a lot of repetitions in many lectures. It´d be good to avoid that aspect in order to provide more information to the people.",4
6478,"Very educational course, however the lectures are very lull and do not hold attention well.",4
6481,This course is very interesting but in some points it get repetitive and it gets boring. I recommend to reduce some videos and not to say the same thing too many time even when it's very important,4
6485,So nice... I've learnt a lot.,4
6488,good course,4
6492,Very important course that help to know several ways of anti microbial susceptibility testing.,4
6495,A good overview on antimicrobial resistance and how it is measured in the lab.,4
6497,"I really enjoyed the course, being a complete novice i found it challenging to understand some of the technical terms but learnt alot.",4
6499,"Really great, a little more specificity on the subjects (More time) would be even better.",4
6502,Great Course!! Some lectures were repetitive. So I'd like to suggest the course advisors to cut down on those lectures. Overall it was a great learning experience!!,4
6507,"Excellent course, plenty of food for thoughts! I totally enjoyed it.",4
6509,"unnecessary, excessive and distracting time expent on the difference between pali and sanskrit.",4
6510,"The course has some Immense contribution by many brilliant professors, monks and practitioners. A Huge workload though, I had to make new replacements three times to catch up with the assignments, lots of resources, I also kept making screenshots as it is impossible (like absolutely!!) to digest all the gems provided. Special thank you to Dr. David Germano for super organised and put together lectures, and Dr. Clifford Saron, just listening to the later speak is a great deal of meditation - so special and highly connecting. Thank you to all creators and contributors!",4
6520,Very intense course,4
6542,"Before I began this course, I had only a very general knowledge of Buddhist meditation. After going through a number of lessons, I realized I really knew less than I thought. I had only been attracted to the Buddhist world encountered in readings and travels. For many years, it was something that I wanted to know more about. So I appreciate having access to this course.Classification and organization of detailed and complex material is well organized. Great work amassing and presenting knowledge of contemplative practices.I feel there was some repetition or redundancy, but in my case that was not necessarily a bad thing, other than to add to the mass of information being delivered. The repetition helped to stabilize my memory and helped to establish a baseline of concepts from which to build my understanding.I became mired in detail, but absorbed as much as I could in lieu of being able to recall consciously specific pieces of information. I don't want to judge the presenters by suggesting that they tried to put too much information into too little of a space. I found my efforts to absorb the info meditative in nature, thus I welcomed the challenge.The videos of presenters reading texts of detailed and dense info was difficult to follow at times, but I discovered that it helps, in some cases, to download the script of the talks and follow along with the video as I read the script.The focus on history and historical debates and conflicts between shamatha and vipassana practices, etc., within Buddhism were helpful but not as key as the meditation practices. I suppose it is difficult to separate them since they are so entwined.I have learned a lot more than I ever expected when I began this course.I value discussions and sharing among students, but the course is so dense and time consuming that I had no time left to participate in sharing with others. Not to devalue the info itself, which is fantastic.",4
6549,"Excellent guided meditations and a very well organized and well presented overview of the Lesser Vehicle of Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. The layout of the course was particularly good; with a theme each week and a set of lectures exploring the practice in question from a cultural and spiritual viewpoint, a set touching on the scientific aspect of the practice, a set outlining the history of the practice, and a series of guided meditations.",4
6557,"All right, this is not a very ""easy to follow"" course. But it's such a great opportunity to deeply study the subject with great specialists and meditation practitioners : how lucky we are ! By going slowly, step by step, being aware that I do not understand everything at once, I'm all right, convinced I'm learning a lot, from both an academic and personal point of view.",4
6562,Great content - learned a lot. Would be easier to follow if David's lectures would be presented more accessible - not read in a monotone voice.,4
6574,"Really like what I have taken away from the course. I felt the presentation of some of the information a bit overwhelming, pure lecture without any visuals.As a suggestion, I think it would have been interesting to hear the presenters talk about their own personal journey/story with respect to meditation, even if it is purely academic without any practical implication for them personally.Many, many thanks!!",4
6579,Overall - Good course - covers both theoretical & practical.,4
6580,"Very nice course, it varies a lot with the content so many different angles are mentioned.",4
6581,"Interesting topic, . but the videos are too long and sometimes lack of dynamism . I recommend the comparison with Science.",4
6582,Very good. There is room for improvement. Congratulations.,4
6585,"The course was a very comprehensive introduction to Buddhist Meditation:- there were lectures about the different Buddhist meditation traditions- practical trainings on Buddhist meditation- neurological and psychological view on the effects of meditation on the human bodyand many more topics related to meditation.I found the course was actually overloaded with content: most videos were too long and there were too many videos. Some videos were more like reading a text: the lecturer was most likely reading his own script from a Teleprompter instead of really talking to the audience. The videos were not bad, but I see some room for improvement for most videos of most lecturers. My favourite videos were from Anam Thubten, he was most genuine and convincing to me.All in all it was still an excellent introduction into the topic for me: a big thank you to all people involved, you did a great job!!",4
6587,"Super experience. The teacher I found less convincing is Prof. Germano who is very learned and knowledgeable, but conveys his lessons with an extremely boring, monotonous voice, adding lots of details making it difficult for students to grasp the essential ideas. Other than this, I loved the rhythm and the many wonderful teachers who shared their knowledge with us.",4
6588,"I enjoyed the course, the structure and the material. I really enjoyed the interviews with some of the speakers. Occasionally certain lectures were a little dry for video.",4
6595,I'm giving this course four stars because of the ground breaking nature of what is being attempted here. I appreciate its place in the historical assimilation of Buddhism into Western culture. I applaud the diverse and interesting bunch of people brought together to present the course. This despite the mediocre presentation skills of the principal course academics.,4
6603,This course is pretty amazing and contains an enormous amount of information. Some of it is presented in a very boring and hard to follow way. It took patience but is worth the time.,4
6606,"Good content. MIght want to change up the presentations for variety - add visual aids, etc.",4
6610,"The content of this course was superb. The level of detail and the connections between traditional teaching with modern science and western practice was very helpful, and much appreciated. The interviews and additional content on practice and historical significance was wonderful. The neuroscience content was presented very effectively, with just the right amount of detail needed here, and the critique and straightforward way that the research was presented was masterful, and so much needed in today's cult-like vision of meditation. I look forward to the other 3 segments of the course.I would recommend putting the transcripts of the lectures together in a more easily readable format, then use the videos by Dr. Germano to highlight the issues presented rather than just reading.",4
6619,"The content of the course is amazingly rich. I've particularly appreciated all the interviews.The science was also very interesting, although at the end (starting from week 4 if I remember well), the result don't seem so convincing. But it is still really amazing. (May I suggest to try to use Machine Learning algorithm to analyze the huge amount of result from the retreat project, they are getting pretty good at facial recognition and analysis.)The contemplative labs were an interesting plus.The only caveats is that, although the content presented by Germano and Schaeffer is amazing (and precious to me), I think they could improve the presentation. I would suggest to consult with a specialist in communication who will be able to point out what could be improved and how. I feel that without that, the communication objective will fail (as reported by most students including myself). Here are a few points I have noticed. Complex background create a distraction, especially when the reading is monotonous, it's preferable to have simple neutral background, like a library. Reading in a monotonous voice is not engaging for the viewer. Dandling around and all sort of gestural distractions don't help us focusing on the content. Sentences are too long and use too many technical words, two things that any communicator will immediately suggest to drop especially if you are targeting a large audience. In one video the background was nice (a forest), yet the noise of the bird were too loud compare to the voice. Plus there was many cut in this video and almost every time the camera had moved from its previous position creating yet another distraction. But don't get me wrong, I have appreciated this content, I just felt that it needed a huge investment from my part to be able to grab it into memory and learn from it. This is the reason why I haven't graded this course with 5 stars. I think that if the speaker could improve this part it would facilitate the students work and improve greatly the overall learning.",4
6621,Great,4
6625,Most of the interviews were very interesting and useful addition to the lectures. Prof. David Francis Germano questions were of good standard.,4
6635,"The content is great, I think the delivery could be better, and there was a great deal of interesting but difficult and for me peripheral stuff about how the brain worked. Nevertheless, even this had me wowed at times. I have learnt a great deal from every aspect of this course, and am greatly looking forward to future courses, as you have promised!. A",4
6638,"This was the first MOOC I ever signed for and I wasn't disappointed. Far more complex, detailed and demanding than I had expected.... which suited me perfectly.Although brilliantly researched and scripted, Professor Germano's detailed input is spoiled by his unecessarily academic style. I found that his tendency to accumulate endless lists of adjectives had an unfortunate hypnotic effect.I very much like the material presented by Kurtis Schaeffer, especially his contribution on the development of Buddhism in the US. His interviews were well-conducted and his remarks always to the point.Interesting - and again complex material from Clifford Saron who managed to caputre the attention of my rather non-scientific brain. Very well presented material and a pleasure to listen to him.The input from the Tibetan participants was more accessible to non-specialists, straight to the point and very refreshing.The work done by the meditators was brilliant and probably what I had been looking for when I registered for the course. I feel that I now know just enough to pursue the practices on my own. It all feels very new, a little bit scary, quite exhilarating and luminous.Some of the interviews were more interesting than others but they all contributed to broaden the scope of the course.I only give 4/5 to the MOOC because of the poor quality of the subtitles. Not being a native speaker and not used to hear American English, I had to rely on them. They were so bad that, at times, what was written was exactly the contrary to what was being said. Hardly any proper names or foreign words were spelt correctly either. Beware !The course has introduced me to a new world and I will definitely pursue my new-born interest in Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. I will also sign up for more MOOCs in the future. Overall an extremely positive experience indeed. I am looking forward to seing you again for the 'Greater Vehicle'.",4
6639,Meditation is an amazing practice and can change and save lives. I reccomend that more people spend a few minutes a day becoming who they truly are.,4
6659,"Insightful travel throughout Beethoven's music writing style, and more generally on musical structure of piano sonatas before and after Beethoven's contribution.",4
6660,Very nice time spent with an talented person... Highly recommend,4
6668,"This was an enjoyable course taught by someone who is obviously not only a superb pianist and musician but also completely in love with Beethoven's piano music. The reason for my 4-star rather than 5-star rating was that I felt the teaching would have benefited from a few visual aids as well as demonstrations at the keyboard. As Mr Biss appeared equally enthusiastic about the music of Haydn, perhaps we might look forward to 'Exploring Haydn's Piano Sonatas' in the future?",4
6676,The course is rich in information and I appreciated the fast pace of the professor's lectures (especially his enthusiasm and passion for the subject which I found delightfully infectious ha) - however I feel that for many people his very quick elocution was perhaps a bit of a minor hindrance for those that process information a touch slower. I definitely plan to resume this course as I enjoyed the professor's manner and passion.,4
6747,"The course was very informative and interesting , I had a tough time doing the assignments but it was worth learning.Definitely a interesting insight into the building blocks of a computer.",4
6748,I got principles of computer,4
6764,"participation by the professors in the discussion forums , would in my opinion get this 5 star rating, overall a very innovative & fun course",4
6768,"very interesting, constructed well and in escalating difficulty level.cons: hard to debug using the emulators",4
6772,"The HDL syntax I felt was a bit fiddly, and sometimes hard to find the relevant technical details such as language definitions in the videos, but overall a very interesting and enjoyable course. Happy to pay for it despite it essentially being available free.",4
6783,"I loved this course. Some criticism though is that the course doesn't go into detail on the architecture of modern day computers. Also, some things were simplified in the course, which is a little disappointing. However, I did get to build my own computer, and I learned quite a lot from this course, so it was definitely worth spending time taking the course.",4
6795,Fun course to take. Makes you realize how much we depend on abstraction in our world. A few notes on documentation (your own code) and version-control would complete it...,4
6799,"Very good cource, but only first part of it",4
6804,nice lecture to know someting about the elctronics ...thanks...,4
6822,one of the best courses one can take to understand how computers are build from ground upThe course is organized in such a way such that its very easy to understand and relate,4
6824,Really good one. Would be 5 stars if there was better support.,4
6827,Had A lot to learn from this course ... Thanks,4
6831,"I was skeptical of HDL at first, and wished that the course had used a more industry-friendly language. I'm glad the instructors addressed this in the course. The HDL language used in the course is simple enough that hardly any time is ""wasted"" learning it.",4
6838,"Fantastic course. I found it challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so difficult that I got annoyed or frustrated. However, a lot of the material I found to be a re cap of concepts I was already vaguely familiar with having worked in IT for 20 years. A true beginner would most likely find some of the concepts difficult to start with - but keep at it!",4
6850,"Good starting point but very slim on the 'why's and the hardware is quite unlike anything you'd find in real life. In addition, I feel they leave too much unsaid and rely on visual comprehension far too much. I had to use the book to figure out the last two weeks. Overall, I did learn the more practical sides of hardware that other textbooks failed to convey. If they would add a Status register and break 'branching' into a separate instruction then I'd be happy with the CPU.",4
6873,Having none prerequisite is quite surprising indeed.,4
6882,Very good explanation by the professor. I have learnt a lot from this.,4
6886,"This course is interesting and well presented. The lecturer injects humour as well as a sense of curiosity into the topics. However, I would have liked to see more mathematics and derivation of justifications of theories. Much of the material was presented as mere facts or observations with little attempt to show reasoning which leads to the conclusions.",4
6922,"This course is very nice, just needs more details in the lectures to explain some difficult points in a simple way. And the homeworks could be much comprehensive to help students understand the rational of each theory. Although this could require adding more weeks but up to 8 weeks is worth doing as this course is essentially taken by students with research goals (like me). I hope we can see some improvements in this course year.",4
6930,"A bit too much math in the questions, although it seemed (in the videos) that we could skip it. I'm very visually oriented (and also a MENSA member), and I would have explained more with graphics. Or at least not have to much 'equations' in the questions.",4
6932,Simple. Informative. Neat and smart.,4
6939,"I get lost by the end, but was a great course, now I understand alot of things",4
6959,Very interesting course and good information. Could you more explanation and exercises to bridge gaps for those that are new to the field.,4
6968,Very nice lecture(s)...,4
6971,Introduces many interesting topics.,4
6994,"Very interesting topics, nice pictures and animation in the videos, the lecturer with deep insight into the problems.",4
6998,"I really enjoyed this course a lot. However i am not familiar with Math, i could pass this course with 92.8% and for me this high grade.Thanks a lot for Tokyo University and Prof.Maruyama who exerted a great effort in this course , and Also i wanna thank Coursera Team too, because made this course available to students who live in arid countries.Ahmed Osama Abdelnaeem.",4
6999,Very interesting,4
7002,It is a little bit hard for the newbie of astronomy. But I do learn a lot from your course. It is quite interesting. Thank you.,4
7003,A great review of current advancements in physics presented in a manner comprehensible to people with basic physics knowledge. Only issue was with some slides which had text in colours which was difficult/impossible to read for my type of color blindness.,4
7019,It was a wonderful experience.,4
7027,4 stars I given because there is no mathematical calculation,4
7029,simple and don't need much background knowledge,4
7038,I've excitingly learned about form particle physics to cosmology in this course.I recommend this course for who want to get what universe in a nutshell.I believe that this course is a nice entry class of cosmology.,4
7040,"Really nice course but not so advance, more like popular-science but anyway you can learn a lot of interesting things.",4
7050,"it is good course for me and i study more thing of universe ,think you",4
7063,Great course!,4
7068,"Nice course. It has touched week every topic, but the quizzes are badly done.",4
7076,I really like this course. I recommend for students and professors/teachers. It's a course gives you differents tools for the way you deal a complex concept or problem.Congratulations to the professors and also those involved directly and indirectly.,4
7083,Very Good! Thanks for everything. See you.,4
7087,"Great classes, but lack of practical examples.",4
7106,Very interesting! It was a nice option to get into Cousera's courses. It makes us feel a little less dumb and brings some useful tools.,4
7110,It is very good to understand how the brain works. I totally recommend the course.,4
7119,This course helped me a lot to figure out how our brain works and we can take some benefits of this.,4
7120,Great course which bring to us improvements in our way studying.,4
7136,Helloto all how works in this course thank you,4
7142,Another great social norms social change online course.,4
7145,A Good course with an informative execution centred curriculum,4
7150,This was really a great course and it has given me tool s for proper investment.,4
7173,good cource,4
7177,Very well explained,4
7179,Best course on Various Big Data models and management systems.,4
7186,"Course is very good, and highly recommended.More practice on this course will be appreciated",4
7188,This course captures the overview of Big data modelling concept in a very simple way. I found this course very useful. Instructors are good to explain the concepts. Though it would be good to add one or two (add-on or optional hands on exercises) handson for graph and tree data modelling.,4
7195,Some concepts can be simplified by using comprehensive examples.The course is overall great!,4
7196,"Pretty good overall, although some exercises are a bit difficult to understand from the descriptions and instructions given, some graphs and initial reference documentation for exercises might help",4
7197,Peer Assignment is not too clear,4
7198,Assum lectures! Cant except better than that challenging assignments.,4
7203,Great course which gives you insights into Big Data Management and various product differentiation used for Big Data,4
7204,Great course! Although I think it would be a good idea to have all the HANDS ON instructions downloadable as a PDF to keep in personal files.,4
7209,"Overall relevant and clear presentations. Course material quite general, but I guess this is expected from an introductory-level course.Peer-reviewed assignment's instructions can be clearer.",4
7210,So useful and focus on main basic aspects.,4
7219,Interesting. Sometimes a little bit overwhelmed by a lot of information within a single video but it gives you an overview of what is big data modeling and management systems.,4
7220,The course was very informative. One suggestion would be to include more practical exercises as it would help in internalizing the concepts better.,4
7222,This course is a valuable introduction to Big Data Models and Management Systems for a variety of data types. The hands on exercises and company use case examples provide helpful context and application of the concepts. This knowledge also provides the learner with more confidence in navigating big data conversations in a professional environment.,4
7230,"Very good material and overview. However, still a little bit too basic. Fundamental management systems hands on should be much more intensive.",4
7236,it was nice but a bit complicated for beginner though i like it,4
7238,Not too much useful and practical knowledge. full of basic concepts,4
7240,"it's pretty good. I learn a lot, but some information is not enough, for example TF-IDF, and vector model",4
7248,Great,4
7250,Good course! Although there was some grading issue for last assignment,4
7251,The course was very helpful,4
7253,good course,4
7260,If you want to learn BI basics and Deep insights into how BI works and you want BI as a career go for this course.,4
7265,Excellent content and references to additional materials.,4
7266,"Concepts covered a slightly harder to comprehend than with the previous courses in the specialization. I found myself having to keep going back and forth through the lessons in an attempt to understand. You really do need to read up on other sources to plug in some gaps, but overall it is a good course that covers a lot.",4
7269,This course need Michael Manino.,4
7271,Thanks for a great course,4
7297,It was very complete. The videos and the pictures were good to understand the ideas.,4
7298,"Interesting content, great stuff for every parent.",4
7304,"The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition. The graphics and didactic material is very good. I would suggest that Dr. Maya improve on her cooking skills (cutting and chopping), It takes too long to do every task and she must use appropriate tools. also, measurements are very important in the kitchen to be disregarded as she does. Remember, she might be teaching to people that have not cook at all. Cooking without measuring is for an expert or a least for somebody with some cooking experience.",4
7318,A brief and useful introduction to nutrition and building healthy eating habits from childhood—absolutely worth my time.,4
7319,Enjoyed it but perhaps a little too basic for my needs. Still would recommend if you are not familiar with nutrition.,4
7326,"I don't agree with everything that is being said. For instance, I prefer not to use sugar at all when it comes to cooking for my family. But still, some practical ideas are included and the recipes are easy to cook.",4
7330,This course is very helpful for young parents and caregivers.,4
7332,It´s good but really basic,4
7347,"Excellent course, the only thing I would change is the meat dishes suggestions.",4
7350,Quite useful ! Easy to understand and nice hits for child nutrition.,4
7351,Very clear and fun. I really like it. Thanks,4
7356,"Pretty easy, only complaint is that the instructor says the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body. This is not true and made me question the rest of the material in the course.",4
7363,"I think it's very nicely organized. However, most of the information is common sense to me. But I really enjoyed the cooking demonstrations and gardening tip. Definitely thinking about starting a basil plant.",4
7367,Interesting info. loved the videos :),4
7400,This course introduces the topic in interesting way and should be checked by anyone interested in healthy nutrition and eating habits not only for kids.,4
7403,This was a great learning experience about nutritional food and explored various options to inculcate healthy eating in today's food intake.,4
7429,The relevance of this course material for a common Indian household is not much as our basic meal have almost all the component of balance diet. But the growing trend of busy life in big cities has started the dependence on fast food in India too so somehow this will help people to remind the importance of home cooked food.,4
7432,Very useful and closely related to our daily life. Highly recommended!,4
7433,I love the information you gave us. I wish you have more recipes.,4
7439,Good course. A little basic.,4
7446,"An informative, easy-to-understand introduction to child nutrition and cooking.",4
7451,"I really liked this course. It has given me a renewed appreciation for home cooking. My favorite part was the hand drawings for the main content videos. I also liked all the cooking demonstrations. I plan on trying them real soon In the future, I'm hoping for more content and the opportunity to earn a certificate. I'd like to see a section specific nutritional targets for certain age groups. Menu planning would also be welcome.",4
7461,UsefulEasy to understand and grasp the fundamentalsEssential for parents,4
7464,I really enjoyed the course.Short videos communicating essential information.I have become health conscious and now more careful while choosing foods to buy or cook.I would recommend this course to every one willing to have a healthy life.,4
7466,practical approach and good nutrition looked easy and inexpensive.,4
7473,"I really liked this course, although the things cooked in it were a little basic. That being said, it is an admirable cause and I found Maya really inspiring!",4
7479,Good basic information for every parent to know.All of us should make time to cook healthier food for our families.,4
7481,It s brilliant course for teachers and mothers. I found it very useful as found information regarding allergies and what we can substitute for that specific allergic ingrediant.,4
7485,"Very easy to go through, the material sticks to you and you will be making healthy choices in no time.",4
7489,Nice and basic information covered. Nice to have the interaction with the learnes and their dishes. Would be great to have a follow up with more in depth info about Food requirements of the different age,4
7491,"This course has shown me very interesting facts about food and how to ensure that a child is getting the nutrients they need for their development and in a fun, involved way.",4
7494,"In general, this course is very nice and informative but the recipes should mention cooking time. Also, I find it a bit scary that the author doesn't make her own chicken broth a processed one.",4
7498,"Don't have a kid, but learned a lot about food and some basic recipes which will make my decision making for heatlhier food easier. Liked it that you also come from a doctor's background and gave a lot of medical research insights.",4
7503,"my 1st course, easy to follow and kept my attention",4
7508,Very simple to understand.,4
7516,"As an expecting mother, this course was just what I was looking for! Thank you, Miss Maya & family. And thank you for making this available to me, Stanford School of Medi",4
7520,"It´s a great Course for unexperienced Cooks. Most of the recipies are very Basic but I think they encourage People to cook even if they´re not used to cooking a lot. The explanations are very clear and easy to follow. Personally, I would have loved to hear more about preparing and storing homemade Food (freezing, storing in jars etc.)",4
7528,Great little course,4
7531,This course is well crafted and perfect for those who need to understand the basics of child nutrition and cooking. The instructor includes cooking tips and recipes that will be most useful to kitchen newbies and those who are trying to make healthier food choices in the kitchen.,4
7534,I don't think the food in course suit to every child.,4
7538,wonderful info. thank you so much!,4
7541,I don't think this course is for everyone. It's for the more industrialised societies who eat everything out of a jar. Not for those of us who still cook everyday. Having said that there was some information that was new and useful and some very good ideas to get kids more interested in the food they eat. I enjoyed it.,4
7561,"Interesting, the information is very basic so if you already have some knowledge in nutrition it may be a little bit to simple. That's the only reason I put a 4 stars and not a 5, is a great introduction to nutrition.",4
7571,Maya is a wonderful teacher. She presents the information in a way that is easy to understand and follow,4
7577,"Really educational and full of interesting and valid arguments! Thank you, professor!",4
7581,"I think this was a great intro course and parents would benefit from it greatly. I wish more of the recipes were vegetarian and diary free (I was in fact surprised that so much diary was part of the recipes). Regardless, a lot better foods than those being served on a regular basis.",4
7586,Very basic introduction and crash course to child nutrition and cooking. For the busy parent/working adult.,4
7589,"This goes over basics for how to involve kids, which is great. If you're already a thoughtful cook, it may not have a ton for you as far as recipes go but the information on how we use our nutrients and balancing food is fantastic.",4
7594,"I found most of what was presented very interestng. I found that when the lesson on chicken soup and stew was being presented, that you used chicken broth from a box. To get better flavour of your chicken soup, why not just add one cube of beef? Better yet, with your stew, why not add some homemade veggie stock which can keep in the freezer?Overall I enjoyed the course, but if you could address the above issue of chicken broth from a box, i would appreciate it. Also, is there a way to get your drawings from this lesson? Thank you",4
7597,"simple, very good and interesting classe!",4
7603,"Easy to follow, and good contents",4
7604,"There was a lot of very valuable information in the course, and I very much liked the general structure. However, maybe it was due to my career and family background, but there was also plenty of information that I had mistaken as common knowledge. Apparently I have more knowledge in this area than I assumed.Overall, this was a very interesting course, and the combination of the videos and smart board graphics helped keep things interesting. I would very much recommend Child Nutrition and Cooking!",4
7610,"This course provides great information. If you have taken any other basic nutrition courses, as I have, most of the information is review. I found the that info wasn't necessarily specific to children but could be applied to all individuals regarding healthy eating, choosing local/organic etc. Even if you don't have children and want to learn more about healthy eating, this course would be beneficial for you.",4
7615,It is a great course. You could learn basic things about nutrition and how can you improve your children's,4
7617,"nice content and videos, good examples. For people in the basic is real good.",4
7620,Great format and which was easy to follow.,4
7626,"This is a very clear and very well presented course. It covers the science of nutrition as well as the practical aspects of cooking through demos. The instructor speaks clearly and knowledgeably about her subject.I will note that it is definitely a beginner level course. If you already do a fair bit of cooking from scratch and have already read some Michael Pollan books, you may not learn much that is new to you.What it does though, it does very well.Also, the instructor's kitchen is beautiful and I spent most of the lectures coveting it greatly :)",4
7634,Brilliant! A must for anyone responsible for children's nourishment.,4
7646,Very good tips to help making the entire family eat better,4
7649,"Very helpful. Straightforward and practical. I like the way Dr. Adam explains nutrition and I strongly agree with her views on home cooking, avoiding processed food and including children on every step of food preparation.",4
7652,Good course for feeding children. very nice instructions. thanks to teacher.,4
7656,"Some of the information from video to video was repetitive. However, I learned a lot about how organic food is good for people and the environment. Additionally, it was great to see how children can get involved in the kitchen and i hope that any parents who watch this try to get their children to be involved with a small garden or helping to prepare meals. Hands-on is the best way for kids to learn!",4
7669,"I love the teaching style that Maya provides. The diagrams are cute and engaging.A great course for those who are not used to eating healthy, and do not cook on a regular basis.For those who are already health conscious and enjoy cooking, this course may not provide you with much new information, but rather confirmed what I already knew and was taught as a child by your mother, or through learning how to cook healthy meals for yourself.",4
7684,Thank you.,4
7685,"I enjoyed taking this course because not only was it very insightful, but also easy to understand. The science behind the way our body processes foods is beautifully drawn and illustrated using charts and diagrams. It makes the course enjoyable and easy to follow.",4
7688,Very useful to apply in daily life,4
7696,An awesome course that not only teach us about nutrition but also many different recipes....The teaching method and the teacher used is the best!!!Really enjoyed.. :),4
7698,"The presenter is very confident and extremely passionate about what she is discussing. I have had a change of heart about how to take care of my child's diet. Usually the video presentations are great, very high quality, my only niggle is that sometimes the black screen PPTs go on for a bit too long, and can be repetitive. Overall a very good course.",4
7701,It's a very helpful course ...Thank you.,4
7705,Great course that teaches you the basic for a good child nutrition,4
7706,Very good but basic information. This class covers some good solid skills everyone should have for reading labels and preparing their own meals at home.,4
7713,It is nicely described.Language and accent used is very much easy to grasp.Well categorized and presented lecture are helpful to memorize the information.,4
7725,it was very educational and gave me great tips on how I should stay healthy.,4
7733,easy to get .,4
7735,"While some of the information was a bit basic for someone who is a bit familiar with the material, it was an awesome review and I can see this providing a lot of great and wonderful information to someone who may not be as familiar. I would definitely recommend this course.",4
7738,It's a great course and I enjoy it a lot. I learned useful information and great tips and tricks. I love visual aids (the black board) and cooking demonstrations. However I had a strong feeling that it is designed mainly for learners from the US.,4
7746,"Pretty good, I like it! It is easy to understand and makes me want to try a more healthy life.",4
7756,It was fun doing this course and at the same time was quite informative. The small things matters most is what you realise and long time back Mahatma Gandhi has said most of the things especially the economic and ecological aspects of our food consumption and habits and has predicted the difficulties we would face. JC Kumarappa on Economy of Permanence is a good read in this regard. Excellent presentation and even a kid will watch it with great interest.,4
7761,"I enjoyed the course overall. However, I wish it was a bit more informative. I know that the course was designed as simple and efficient as possible but personally, I wished that there was a bit more depth. However, enjoyable course overall.",4
7763,Very good for parents who do,4
7772,The course was very informative. I enjoyed doing this course.,4
7776,Very good basic teachings that can get anyone with a family set to start cooking more nutritious and delicious meals for the whole family. I like how simply it is and how one can easily apply the knowledge to their every day lives.,4
7778,This course is v.nice& useful. I gain so much knowledge,4
7783,I learned some new information in this course and was reminded of some healthy eating habits I had forgotten. I love that she cooks meals cooking show style. The class about how to stock your pantry for healthy eating was particularly helpful.,4
7784,"I enjoyed this course because it taught me about chemicals contained in processed foods, and showed me healthy recipes.",4
7785,"I enjoyed this course very much and found it to be a very good introduction to the science of nutrition and cooking. It wasn't focused on children as much as I thought it would be. I would have liked to know a lot more about portion sizes and calories intake, which weren't much discussed. I knew that some foods were good and others were bad... thanks to the course, I now also know why! I didn't find the course too challenging and thought that Maya Adams was a very pleasant instructor.",4
7788,I loved this course. It was full of great ideas and amazing recipes that I shared with my friends. Thank you,4
7809,"I love the course, even I am not a mother, but soon I will be, so I think this course really helpful. It gives me knowledge about how to give food to your family especially children. Start from choosing the ingredients up to cook it in a proper way.Thank You",4
7823,This course is very useful and easy for me to follow it. I'll try to do some nutritive meal,4
7827,Useful and helpful strategies and information about nutritional cooking.,4
7833,"Nice, easy and healthy recipes!",4
7846,"I like the structure of the course as well as its presentations.The instructors are very lively and creative in providing real-life information and materials.I suggest to have more courses with her that has a deeper understanding of child nutrition in various age groups.However, some of the cooking demonstrations do not indicate the temperature and duration of the heating.That's why I gave the course 4 stars.",4
7849,"This is a very good course, however it does not take into consideration certain details we learn in Nutrition. For instance the use of wood type instruments for cooking, they can hide microorganisms and the use of oil to fry when the best option would be baking.",4
7852,You learn a lot about nutrition without being overwhelmed.,4
7853,Sounds interesting course.,4
7858,Super useful! But I think it should have more chemical about the reactions of food in our bodies,4
7864,"loved learning the great simple healthy recipes! Also great information for kids, teens, and adults.",4
7869,it's the core information that every parents or even every person should know about food & nutrition. this course has made me cook for our kids and plant our own veggies.,4
7870,"I found this course very much valuable for kids as well as other elder people. The teaching method was highly impressive and Dr. Maya Adam really inspired me. I wanted to give 5 stars but I found few things missing, such as food recipes were without quantity of items (especially in written format), gardening was described in a very short format (I felt that it required little bit more detail), market visits could be a very healthy and informative section, some experts advice & suggestion (including famous chefs), some discussion over food available and prepared in hotels/restaurants & also visits over there. Over all it's really a good course and I would definitely recommend to others. My all the best wishes to Dr. Maya Adam such a great work and hope see more from her.Thank you.Regards,Shoukat Shadat Ali",4
7872,I enjoyed the course and I cooked some of the dishes it is really taste great beside it is healthythank you!,4
7877,"Very nice and interesting course with a lot of useful informaion, easy to learn and understand. Thank you! Do you have part 2 of this course?:))",4
7884,Great course for beginners!,4
7885,"There's a little bit too much in the way of ""buy organic!"" when there's no evidence to recommend that but other than that a very nice course. I would recommend that they retool it to be more accessible to people on the lower income brackets. I got news for you, ""almond flour"" is not something most people are going to spring for when it costs several times what wheat flour does.",4
7904,"A pretty solid course, though there does appear to be a degree of cognitive bias regarding certain farming methods.",4
7906,i like this course very much....and this is my 1st course....,4
7916,"Light but insightful. The course felt very humanized, as something anyone can relate with, so it feels like you are learning things that apply to your day to day lifestyle. Even thou I had a major understanding of the field, I still really enjoyed the class.",4
7945,Amazingly simple reasons and ways in which we can keep children's food nutritious and healthy!,4
7953,"This course refreshed my knowledge, and I also learned many new aspects on nutrition for children. This course is useful for me who is a new mom and preparing to go back to work soon. The summary and graph are vivid and fun, which help the students remember the concepts easily. Thank you for offering the course.",4
7955,I really enjoy how in-depth the lessons are. I have four small children and have learned that they eat and drink what we do because they love to mimic us as their role models and if we would not want a bunch of junk in our bodies why should our children. This world is so fast paced and fast food junkies yet we can still make even small choices that are healthy for us like maybe a grilled chicken or a salad if we absolutely have to have something while out. Otherwise it's much better and cheaper to cook at home and have family time,4
7961,Quite basic but some tips are useful to know.,4
7966,Very useful course.It should have contained few food recipes of different countries.Great learning about child nutrition.Thanks n regards.,4
7982,"I liked the course, however it was too basic.",4
7993,"I felt like a lot of this information was VERY basic, and then I consider the people around me and how little they know about food and nutrition. Someone like my niece who is young with an infant would definitely benefit from this course. I like the way the information was presented, very easy to comprehend. Overall I'd recommend this course if you are interested in knowing a bit more about nutrition regardless if you have a child.",4
7995,"This was a good introduction to Coursera for me. Some of the information I already knew, but it was good to learn the ""why"" behind some of it. There were a few of the quizzes that contained questions from videos that hadn't been covered yet. Her information about food allergies was good, I would like to see her offer a class on just that topic.",4
7998,The recipes shared are simple to follow...,4
8003,A good mix of theory and practice!,4
8006,I found this course very helpful because of its advice on nutrition foods,4
8008,"Very helpful in nutrition, not just for kids, but in general. Made me more aware of some of the processed junk I've been putting in my body",4
8014,"this course is very simple and specific, very important to parentsthanks for all team",4
8016,Very interesting course. Many things I already knew it because I usually ook at home.,4
8019,Great course - I think there could be more on different grain types and alternatives to pasta and potatoes. Also the videos can be speed up during the drawings. Sometimes the sound changes awkwardly during the parts were there is only drawing.,4
8023,"It is easy but useful course for everyone, especially for mums. I really love the teacher who is beautiful and knowledgeable lady.",4
8025,very lovely and easy to understand,4
8026,Great course with fabulous teacher. I still want to learn more!,4
8031,Excellent introduction to child nutrition.,4
8035,"Good science, great explanations, simple recipes with tips and advice. Strongly recommended to people with little/no cooking and/or science backgrounds - especially new university students and parents. However, I would not consider the professor (she is a doctor though) a skilled chef - while her recipes are great and simple, the techniques she uses are perhaps not the best, given that she is conducting a course that's nearly 20% cooking demonstrations. I would strongly suggest consulting a Jamie Oliver book/video, or Michael Smith to augment this course.TL'DR: Great science and explanations, good recipes, could have used better cooking techniques. Good for uni students/healthy eaters.",4
8044,very informative,4
8046,A little too basic but it was a good class. Thanks!,4
8057,is very useful and interesting,4
8064,"It's an excellent course for new moms who are worried about feeding right our children. Maya is really nice, and all the information provided is really helpfull and easy to do in our lifes. Thank you so much for taking the time of doing this course for us.",4
8069,"Good Course, but I was not able to get a certificate for completing it.",4
8080,Great course!. Content was clear and precise. I would have loved to learn more recipes for kids.,4
8081,"Good for public education with general nutrition knowledge integrated with environmental protection, practical behaviors and cooking exercises.",4
8088,loved most of the information. totally loved the recipes and really hope that my grandchildren will,4
8100,"Informative without being preachy. Cute, entertaining drawings.",4
8105,Nicely organised and content rich course; helps to know a lot about child nutrition.,4
8106,"This course was a great refresher for basic nutritional/health information, and comes with a really great message: don't worry if you're not a great ""chef"", basically any home-cooked meal will be healthier than fast or processed food! I enjoyed the cooking demonstrations and simple solutions for making healthy choices.",4
8110,"Very interesting and handy. I'm Spaniard, so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals, and the use of street market for shopping vegetables. But the recipes were fantastic and since I'm a mother of a 1-year-old child, I will put on practice soon. Thank you!",4
8115,"As a college student I really appreciate how many of the tips shared are simple and can be implemented on a day to day basis. A lot the recipes and ideas shared do not require really fancy equipment or ingredients I've never heard of, are super expensive, or hard to find. The instructor truly cares about students leaning how to cook for themselves and eat healthier and provides information to do so without judgement. Her passion is clear and I love how she promotes little steps and not some drastic change that can eat up all of your energy and focus to implement. Thank you!!!!",4
8127,"This course is great!! And fun too...I learn many thing that I've overlooked for these years, just like nutrition label and soon. This course tell me the basic knowledge of healthy meal and the importance of making my own meal. Unfortunately, this course is pretty much short like the other...It'll be SUPER if the content of the course could be extended a lil' bit (or a lot more is better though :p)",4
8131,"Couple things I didn't agree with, but for the audience in mind I think it's very solid and has a wonderful introduction to child nutrition or just to grasp nutrition in general.",4
8132,Very helpful tips!!!,4
8136,"Well,I learnt a lot not only in cooking meal,but also in getting nutrition in healthy way.",4
8139,Good One!!,4
8142,I am a professional Chef and was really helpful for me to get some new view about cooking and using ingredients more careful.,4
8157,Good for everyone,4
8161,clear and easy for me to learn the cooking,4
8165,Really good video lectures! Pedagogical and with many interesting examples. Could have been a bit more of the statistical stuff in som form of interactive exercises.. Perfect for a first grasp on the field of human behavioral genetics!,4
8171,"Thankful that a course like this exists, as most MOOCs are quite basic. And thanks to Coursera for running the courses even though attendance seems to be low (darn, that pesky calculus pre-requisite). Lecture quality is varied--some quite good (such as the lectures in Boot Camp I) and others seem like he hadn't looked at his notes for a long time. It's great to hear a stats professor talk about the strengths and weaknesses of many approaches. It complements a mathematical statistics book quite well. It would have been nice to have had some problems that were more challenging. Overall, while the Johns Hopkins Data Science MOOCs are pretty good, they are a bit more basic than what's available through MIT and Stanford.",4
8179,"If you look for improving your communication skills, then this course is for you.",4
8180,"This Course is great for beginners, and it helped to improve my English considerably.",4
8181,Course is interesting but the quality of the videos sometimes not very good,4
8192,"I think it's a very interesting course, well focused on the strategies to arrange an effective communication.",4
8202,I enjoyed the course. It was a challenge for me to have spoken assignments. But I did it. Thank you I learned a lot.,4
8208,"I really liked the course and how it is designed, I think it is very useful to get familiar with aspects related to pronunciation , intonation and rythmn. Most courses only provide useful expressions and specific vocabulary but this course offers the possibility of sounding natural and fluent in business environments.",4
8232,This course is very useful for all professional as it can be use in dairy working.,4
8237,Some quiz have some bad wording which make it hard to understand.,4
8240,"I'm grateful to the instructor(s). However, when I turned on closed caption to get used to the accent, the CC text covered part of the slide information. Overall, this is a good course to take. I'm glad I took it. Also, I was hoping that there's a clear instruction of Cloudera Quick Start on Linux.",4
8241,Highly Knowledgeable & learning.,4
8243,I enjoyed this introductory course because it really provided the scope for this area of study and helped chart the course for the rest of the specialization as I move forward. Excited to move on through to the next course armed with what I have learned in this one!,4
8245,great course for a beginner,4
8247,Very nice introduction to Big Data. This is were you decide whether to take the blue pill or the red pill (sorry that's from the 1999 movie Matrix ),4
8248,"It is a very interesting course with a lot of information to have a deep introduction to Big Data,Thanks,Eugenio",4
8249,Excellent course. but not fully covered,4
8255,Good first look at Big Data and the concepts.,4
8257,"Overall a good introduction to Big Data. Needed no prior experience, but ironically I found I'd misunderstood the way Map:Reduce worked. Reading around afterwards I worked out exactly how it worked, but I didn't think it was explained very well. Overall though, a great intro into a subject which is highly hyped in the IT industry, and demystifies some of the concepts, explaining what Big Data is good for, and hinting at it's limitations.",4
8264,It is an introductory course. So it does not include much about the subject.,4
8265,"Simple introduction, easy to follow. Probably too simple.",4
8270,Fantastic course and all concepts were very well explained. Interesting quiz at end of every section that tests understanding of the topic and the glimpse of Hadoop in the final section is the best part of the entire course.Hadoop fs -Thanks Ilkay Altintas and Amarnath Gupta :),4
8271,Great Intro.,4
8291,It was very enjoyable course thank you,4
8298,Course Material Was Quite Informative,4
8300,Would love to have more practical hands on exersizes and examples of map reduce.,4
8308,"Good INTRODUCTION , an understanding of data management will help digest alot of it. But very simple and elegant course with only simple concepts to grasp which in reality covers big data pretty well! Excited to take the rest of the courses",4
8319,Good Introduction,4
8320,Good introduction to general concepts. Does not require specific skills,4
8322,"Interesting overview, more examples will perfect it!",4
8328,Learnt a lot about big data and its applications,4
8332,"This topic is new for me, therefore some of the topics required supplemental explanations to fully understand.",4

8338,Nice to get this course.,4
8341,"I learnt basic of Big Data, exicited to dive deeper.Very informative and engaging",4
8343,Great introduction course. The pace is slow enough that a person without technical background should be able to follow it. However as you are not restricted to only do the current week task its also great for someone who had some experience.,4
8344,very good introduction.,4
8346,"Too many concepts, better to provide more interactive questions during the video and more examples to demonstrate the concept.If possible, make the assignment submission free.",4
8357,"This is an introductory course which met my expectations, giving overview with a little hands-on experience. Though instructional skills were not to the mark, supporting material and assignment instructions were good.",4
8359,Excellent introduction to Big Data and Hadoop. Practical exercise reinforces materials.,4
8361,"This is a great introduction to the concepts of Big Data. Compared to whats available online, this course does a great job of digging into the components and definition of big data vs just diving in with code examples. Well worth it for anyone trying to get a holistic understanding of big data.",4
8362,good introduction but it's a little bit expensive.,4
8365,"Very good introduction to the field. Not too complex, so a good starting point.",4
8373,"The course was awesome. It taught me the ins and outs of Big Data. Although its only the basics, I'd still recommend it to everyone before deciding whether you want to keep going as a Big Data specialist or not.Some steps are not uptodate e.g. hadoop and wordcount aren't in the same folder as listed by this course. They were in the other folder /usr/lib... . It'd be nice if you guys put a ""find"" command with that description, because I've had to search it myself. That's why I took one star out of it.",4
8379,"In this course, I learned how to use Hadoop basically. With the clear explanation of the Professor, I believe every one can realize in a short time.",4
8385,Dr Altintas is an excellent presenter and very thorough. I would have enjoyed more practical exercises instead of mainly theory videos. The ones done with Hadoop in the last week were very enjoyable. I also enjoyed Dr Gupta's videos as well. Excellent intro to Big Data.,4
8402,Fun and passion. Expectations met.,4
8407,"Excellent course for beginner in the world of big data. Some issues with the hands-on lab (maybe due to a change in Cloudera softs). Provided examples were not working as-is for me, because of some path issues. But great anyway.",4
8417,More practical use cases and applied knowledge base need to be included,4
8418,It was a Good course to start with the Big Data. The content is also good and properly arranged. Good Instructors. I will suggest this course as a starter for Big Data.,4
8428,great so far.,4

8434,Very basic info.,4
8436,"If you're unfamiliar with how big data is processed and what makes it unique from ""regular"" data, this is a good introductory course. It provides sufficient detail to understand the key concepts, programs, and methodologies around Big Data.",4
8437,Very good course for introduction to big data,4
8438,Very very introductory course.,4
8444,"The course material is overall very good and easy to understand, although a bit abstract at certain points (mostly when it comes to technical things like what MapReduce consists of and what Programming Models are). Regardless, the instructors do a great job of explaining the concepts. Great course overall",4
8447,"First two weeks are too much theory , but i guess that is needed for clear understanding of an awesome week 3.",4
8455,"Map Reduce hands-on assignment does not have very clear instructions, should be improved for future sessions.",4
8457,A great introduction,4
8460,"Content is very interesting, nice introduction to Big Data.Slides can be improved though.",4

8483,Overall a good introduction course to Big Data. It could have been more condensed and contain more programming exercises.,4
8485,Course was good. I had issue to configure virtual machine . but it worked now .,4
8486,"The material OK, but some of the exercises and their interfaces are not well designed.",4
8489,"The beginning is a bit theoretical, only the end brings some practical examples up. Slides are a bit old fashioned and presenters are a bit rigid",4
8500,"The course is very well made, with very clear concepts and therefore very useful to start in the world of Big Data. Recommended for anyone who wants to have a basic knowledge about Big Data.",4
8506,Good work! Thanks for educating,4
8507,Basic and easy clarification of big data.,4
8513,"Loved every second of it, easy to understand, well structured, more big data usage examples in video formats would be a nice addition",4
8517,"For an introduction class in Big Data this is excellent: concepts down to the point; good example analogies used; material provided to reinforce concepts and knowledge (transcripts, slides) were great. Videos were pretty good. Content of lessons are good; lab and software downloading/exercise with Hadoop give you a good sense of what expected in more advance classes.I would add a bit more of information regarding to the downloading software and its purposes for those with no computing background (like what OS used when running the Hadoop... maybe I missed that?).The class worth the money paid.",4
8518,"Good Intro course.for Cloudera VM installation to practice Hadoop session, be ready with at least an i5 PC with 8GB RAM",4
8521,Great course with great instructors,4
8524,Nice course for a starter.,4
8525,"I learned some new things because I'm a total beginner,I think the contents are updated but not very structured,the hands-on part is just a small peek of the whole big data process system and not very useful.It's not a complete course if you don't take the later courses of the whole specialization.So I gave 4 stars for this introduction course.",4
8527,Excellent for a introduction course. More exercises would be nice.,4
8533,"For a introductory course it covers a lot of things, not in too much detail, but it covers a lot of important concepts and definitions.",4
8538,So much better than in the first version of the specialization! the peer reviewed project is a welcome addition to help understanding map reduce concepts,4
8539,"A good introduction, looking forward to the rest of the specialization.",4
8544,This course got upgraded from 2015 to 2016. I wish I did not have to take twice because all the assignments and material seemed the same. Maybe next time you upgrade give students the credit for the classes they already took.,4
8547,Fantastic Course. I'm so happy i took this class,4
8551,A good orientation class to level set key terms and concepts.,4
8552,Good intro,4

8635,"Well-structured course, Dr. Pienta and his fellow team-members are passionate in what they do, and that's evident during the course, but I can't help to think that they have barely scratched the surface here... The lectures are good, they provide a lot of information, but the quizzes offer no challenge whatsoever. That was somewhat disappointing, it felt like I was cheating. All in all, I don't regret buying and completing the course, but I really hope that Dr. Pienta's team will be back soon with a more challenging and advanced course.",4
8636,"Nice overview, not worth 50 bucks.",4
8640,this course very useful to my that i gained a lot of information from this course.,4

8658,"I really enjoyed the course. Very professional training, with lots of insight in cancer therapy.",4
8659,"This was an interesting cancer basics class -- quick and simple for those with minimal background in oncology. The only disappointment was that the course description mentioned quizzes could be taken for no cost, but that turned out not to be true. Nevertheless, it was a valuable course.",4
8677,So far it's a very good course. I always wanted to learn about cancer as it took two lives from my family. I would give it a FIVE STAR if the professors could explain more elaborately as I have very little experience in this field. Thanks a lot,4
8690,Clear and enjoyable course,4
8693,Could have more indepth examinations. Reference material would be useful.,4

9010,Culmination of the courses - to reinforce the learnings,4
9013,Nice and interesting.,4
9016,"The content and the assignment were of high quality and I really enjoyed the case I had to work on.So overal the course was very good, but negative was that the course was a bit too long, I understand Coursera needs to finance the course, so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees. Bu the extra review rounds felt redundant, and because the course was so long it was difficult to keep focussed on it.",4
9021,Interesting subjects to chose from. Also nice and short format of the assignment.,4
9031,"Ira Pohl is a great professor. There were a few glitches in the videos, but overall a nice course.",4
9032,I enjoyed this course a great deal. The review of C++ and introduction of C++11 is exactly what I was looking for. The Hex Game assignment were fun. I was impressed at how the Monte-Carlo method could be used to create an AI player for a game.,4
9038,very clear and useful.,4
9041,"Great professor, but a lot of formatting issues with the problems. To avoid considerable frustration, make sure you reference this page:https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1/discussions/forums/WcY9_8ayEeSWEiIAC0wC5g/threads/CgOJwV-jEeWncxKXIFxpFQ",4
9047,"With all of the changes going on with the coursera platform, some stuff gets changed or messed up. Otherwise, this is a great course! Would watch just for the faces.",4
9058,"I really enjoyed this course but week 9 was extremely ridiculous. I had a hard time relating the examples to the quiz and, when i finally figured it out, the answers were huge and complex numbers. Other then that though, i do recommend this course.",4
9065,Good course. I wish the technical aspects of submitting typed answers had all the bugs worked out. Otherwise great experience.,4
9069,This class is quite accurate and pleasing. I have enjoyed the course,4
9073,"Electric professor! Great course, without doubts.",4
9078,There is no good explanation of how to calculate the equations given in the quizes which is why sometimes i had to fail to figure out how to solve one of the similar equations so I can understand and solve the others. Overall is good and understandable.,4
9087,"Solid course - well taught by highly enthusiastic teacher. Good online support from other participants and course mentors. Only frustration was syntax - sometimes you would get the right answer in a test but the syntax was not recognised (for example sometimes the constant ""E"" had to be entered in lower case and sometimes in upper case.)",4
9108,"if the input format can be explained in detail, could save a lot of time wondering the genuine ""answer"". But, overall, brilliant! really appreciate for the sharing of joys in calculus! thank you!",4
9125,very good course you can review calculus,4
9126,It is very good course and give a better understand in calculus.,4
9129,"I believe that the teacher creates a great way of explaining what seems to be very complicated thought processes, and he does so in a highly enthusiastic manner.The only downside is that such explanations can be either too low level or not strong enough to explain certain phenomena. For example, the professor talks about how the absolute value function of x is not differentiable at zero, and how a function is differentiable at a certain point when the two-sided limit exists and, by extension, the function is continuous at that same given point. However, the professor in this regard never truly explains why the v-shape is not differentiable and how it relates to our definition of continuity. However, overall: a very worthwhile course and a pleasant experience.",4
9136,Great... a bit more variation int he quizzes would be nice,4
9140,"This course is awesome. To listen to professor Jim Fowler break down seemingly hard concepts into easy-to-understand chunks is hugely satisfying. But make no mistake. The course is not easy. But if you put in the effort, you will find it very fulfilling.The last three sections (weeks 14, 15, and 16) are probably the best parts of the course. It’s thrilling to experience professor Fowler solve hairy integration problems with u substitution and integration by parts.The grading section is a little buggy and may cause frustration for learners. But overall, you can work around the bugs if you take the time to review the bug list in the discussion forums.The mentors are fantastic and provide quick responses to your questions on the forums.",4
9168,"Calculus is not an easy part in math, so i didn't hope that i could get through it as quick as possible. But from when i got this course, i see that to access a mindset of math's world needs persevere and connection basically.",4
9169,"I've always had a love for math, however I never did well in the subject in school. It's a paradox, but embarrassingly I struggled to even pass! Well, once I found this course, I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I took it. I've learned new and applied concepts in math and Mr. Fowler makes the lectures easy to understand. The discussion forum and mentors are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this course to others.",4
9185,Good course!!,4
9190,Easy to understand basic concept of calculus but not so challenging.,4
9199,I absolutely love this course. The only thing that I would suggest is going into the trapezoid and Simpson's rule when evaluating areas under the curve.,4
9208,"Good for beginners, but maybe using examples instead of important concepts as elements of main structure can cause confusion.",4
9211,"I have finished this course and moved on to the 2nd part. In sum, the course was excellent and Professor Fowler is terrific at explaining concepts both visually and algebraically. He provides both rigorous and intuitive explanations. I learned a lot and firmed up many concepts. i really appreciated the balance between visual and numerical. The real problem with the course is the quiz CPU. It does not recognize correct answers even when those answers are exactly the same as the ones provided by way of correcting your ""wrong"" answer. There is something really wrong with the quiz review code. That can be a ""downer"" when you are seeking a little encouragement after some hard work - and you know your answers are correct - and In Fact have been correct on the same questions in earlier quizzes. So take the coruse - enjoy the learning - but don't be discouraged because Coursera writes Kludgey code.IThe course is not yet over but perhaps someone will see this and make some changes. The professor is clear and enthusiastic. The main problem with this course is the quizzes. On several occasions I have submitted answers that were completely correct, only to find them all graded incorrect. I know they were correct because I had mathematician friends check them after receiving the failing grades. They could not understand why the quizzes were returned that way. On certain occasions, questions on one quiz were graded correct - and then the exact same type of question on another quiz was graded incorrect. In some cases, my answers were exactly the same as those probided by way of demonstrating the correct responses. Identical - yet marked wrong. When there are several ways to formulate an answer, we have no way of knowing what form is required. On a recent quiz, it turned out the answers were required in raw form - not solved to their numeric conclusion. But how are we to know that? I will write more at the end of the course. It is a good course for learning - but don't get upset if you get a bad grade. It is probably not an accurate reflection of your work. A final point - Professor Fowler should learn to pronounce ""integral."" It is NOT ""intregal."" It is ""integral."" He is, after all, a mathematician. You would not want a surgeon to speak of ""cradiac care,"" would you? Otherwise - terrific class.",4
9216,Just awesome. it simply needs to provide information on assignments when keyboard sucks.,4
9217,"Course seems fundamentally sound. Prof is enthusiatic and obvioulsy highly qualified. Really appreciate the proofs he provides such as the geometric development of the trig derivatives, the chain rule, and the fundamental theorem. I'd give it 5 stars for content and clarity.I am disappointed that some of the lectures were out of sequence with the quizzes and I really found that entering the answers to quizz questions was difficult. In some cases the tool misled me i.e. when the question indicated E should be entered for Euler's constant but the grading tool required e. Also in one instance the grading tool didn't recognize the right answer and I believe the correct answer wasn't even available as one of the choices.",4
9222,Its a very good course. The teacher teachs with love and attention. I just think could have more exercises in video to help to do on the assignments. I recommend!!!!,4
9234,"Really great class! Goes a little fast at some parts, but otherwise engaging and interesting.",4
9239,Its not five stars because there isn't portuguese legends,4
9250,"An awesome course! The teacher is good, and the calendar is well organized.However, as to me, there are some points that have not been explained clearly and the some quizzes are just terrible.Hope to see the improvements.",4
9260,"Very well taught, but I think the exercises were disjointed and did not always fit with what was being taught. Other than that, great course!",4
9261,Awesome course!! It's just that sometimes its a little bit hard to understand XD,4
9274,There are still many more technical issues which lie unsettled for months in in this beautiful and extremely interesting course...,4
9275,"Good course that covers some of the most fundamental concepts behind Calculus. Although the lecturer is quite ""in your face"", the lectures are well structured and well explained. The intro music at every lecture (every 3-5 minutes) is unnecessary and annoying.",4
9282,"The professor's teaching was fun. But you need to rewatch many times if you do not understand. Once you get it, you will blame why you didn't understand it at the first place because it's so simple and you'll then agree with what every words the professor said.",4
9284,"The course itself is fantastic, but submissions toward the end of the course are extremely tedious and cause you to wonder whether or not you did the math correctly.",4
9290,Very fast-paced at times but very informative. He creates an enthusiastic learning process.,4
9298,Great course.,4
9301,"Very good course, although too much long.",4
9309,"The professor is passionate and makes learning calculus as easy as possible. Plenty of videos and explanations, but not many realistic problems given.",4
9311,"Solid course. Good instructor. The quizzes, however, often were inconsistent on how to input Euler's number so that it could be read by the computer. 1 quiz had an item that did not contain a question (Thank god it was multiple choice) , and the last exam asked you to select between two answers which identical except for the fact that one added zero from x and one subtracted zero from x.",4
9318,Very energetic lecturer :) Thoroughly enjoyed.,4
9331,excellent course just let down by the frustrations of the inconsistencies of the marking of quizzes,4
9333,"Professor Fowler is great! He spends some time explaining the theory behind the topic, and makes everything pretty easy to visualize. I would love if there were a few more resources with example problems. The quizzes can be pretty challenging, if you haven't done any practice problems first. My favorite thing about this MOOC and Prof. Fowler is his excitement--which makes it feel, less like a lecture and more, like a fun conversation about calculus.",4
9334,love the explanation. but it would be highly appreciated if some practice material was provided which would be reviewed by experts after completion.,4
9336,Great course for calculus introduction.,4
9349,"The content of this course is fantastic, if you read the textbook with it. It would be 5 stars, but there are a number of glitches in the quizzes and exams. Information about the textbook and quiz issues can be found in the first post on the discussion board.",4
9381,Great course! Everything is explained extremely clearly. The only 'missing star' here is that some of the final quizzes reject the correct answer due to a technical issue.,4
9389,"I wanted the preview function on the quiz to be like ""scratch paper"".",4
9395,it is very niice,4
9398,"very good considering the amount of information conveyed in the short amount of time. A few of the tests were slightly glitchy in the acceptable range of correct answers (in terms of rounding answers) and would only accept things like 17*sqrt(15426) as the answer, even if an equivalent value down to the 6th decimal place was give instead.",4
9410,The content is good. Needs better maintenance. Certain bugs and assignment errors should be rectified.,4
9412,The proof can be more precise and specific.,4
9416,Great,4
9447,I am simply enjoying this. Thank you Dr. Fowler for those wonderful teachings.,4
9448,I thought this was a well presented course with good coverage of the material. Only thing holding me back from giving it a five start rating is a few errors in the quizzes need to be fixed.,4
9464,I have just started but it looking real interesting so far.,4
9475,lectures were really great,4
9493,"The classes are very didactic, however the professor sometimes meanders too much and doesn't get to the point. Also, some of the the quizzes have little or nothing to do with the video lessons.",4
9505,"Energic lecturer. Love it! From how he teaches us, we can judge that he really loves calculus or maybe math in general is his passion.",4
9512,"Great teacher, enthousiastic and energetic. Thanks very much",4
9518,Energetic teacher does a great job of explaining what he's doing.,4
9525,he is really can explain a profound theorie in simple language.,4
9534,Great Teacher with clear examples and presentations !,4
9551,"A very funn course, for the way the professor brings the material, without turning the subject a havy stuff, as it usaually turns out to be with mathematics.",4
9553,This course is just amazing! But it could have been a little short!,4
9556,"Has a bit too many errors in the questions, and there's no proper introduction to new signs.",4
9586,"There're some errors in subtitle, around the Integrals Weeks",4
9600,"Pretty neat course for filling in gaps left by your education system in teaching you, probably the most important of all mathematical concepts, CALCULUS. J. Fowler does a great job of explaining things clearly and is pretty neat, overall. Highly recommended!",4
9621,"Pretty great, must say. The teacher is enthusiastic and quirky while knowledgeable and learnt.",4
9628,"The course is really good, because the teacher is great, but there are some errors in subtitles, and even in some exercises.",4
9632,Exceptional and Unique Style of Teaching!,4
9636,This course was helpful for me. I learned some basic things. Thanks Sir. :),4
9658,It maybe early to say since I am just mid way week 1 but so far it has been great. Thank You Coursera,4
9660,the professor is amazing.,4
9665,"I thought the professor was really great about explaining things in a clear, concise manner. I think some of the quiz problems were more complicated than they needed to be, especially considering that typing in a long string you're very likely to have a typo which results in missing a question you knew how to do.",4
9670,incredible :) It makes me feel the amazement of Calculus,4
9688,"This is the course that I'm taking for right now before closing time for math assignments for me. I know Calculus is a large subject with all new topics dividing into modules. The Calculus 1 will be included functions, limits, infinities, derivatives, and area and integrals. I will just do my best as I can in order to try Calculus; it's going to be tough for me to listen. There's a lot of stuffs going on in Calculus.",4
9689,"thanks , good challenge",4
9691,I like this course full of details.Thanks :),4
9706,This is a beautiful course about Calculus.,4
9707,"Course is really cool, though, there is some as for forms of Answers, e^x or E^x for instance, if fixed, it would get 5 stars",4
9724,"Lively, and more practial",4
9727,Some parts of the course were either not well explained or too rudimentary in relation to the quizzes.,4
9731,"Excellent lectures, and funny, too! I enjoyed this course. There is some problem with some quiz answers that should be fixed.",4
9733,would be 5 star if it gave certificates,4
9738,Great introductory course!,4
9755,"I enjoyed it. Jim Fowler does well, his enthusiasm and the time and effort he (and whatever filming and editing team he has) have put into the presentation is impressive. Difficult for me to rate it as a maths course - how would I know whether it covers what it needs and have anything meaningful to stay about the standard of it. I felt I understood what was going on, I passed the quizzes. Maybe that's all good?Occasional bug in the quizes - nothing you can't work around (eg totally blank question but four answers to choose from.) The mathematical symbol rendering doesn't work on the mobile app at all.",4
9764,"Fun refresher for someone that took Calculus 30 years ago. Great lectures and examples. Quiz answers don't always use the proper ""upper case E"" for e correctly, so be prepared to be marked down for correct answers sometimes (but you can ""correct"" your answers on retake). It would be great to get this fixed!",4
9769,C,4
9777,"Some tasks was hard to understand and solve, but it in general it was good.",4
9778,"The course contents we useful and easy to learn for the most part. The assignments and spot quizzes helped a lot to understand the string algorithms. I appreciate all the effort the instructors put to create the course materials.Few things to improve:1) Some of videos in week3 and 4 were hard to understand due to English speaking skills. I found a lot of grammar mistakes in the subtitles and the interactive transcripts.2) Please consider adding more contents like Boyer Moore algorithm, regular expression and etc.",4
9779,"Initially the accent was a little bit hard to understand, but after few minutes everything become crystal clear. Extremely useful course content.",4
9782,Very focused on bioinformatics problems.,4
9783,"I have only one feedback: the relation between subsequent weeks are not clear. It feels like I am learning one technique in week 3, and then another in week 4, but why is the technique in week 4 necessary? What are the differences in terms of functionality, between the various techniques? I think these points are not explained quite clearly.Great course though, thank you very much!",4
9784,"Quite an interesting and well-organised course, giving a detailed overview of the pattern matching problem and solutions for it (on the other hand, if you are expecting to see a wide variety of string problems, the course title is misleading).Assignments and quizes are also likeable (although the pseudocodes in the slides and the code skeletons for the solutions contain quite a number of mistakes).",4
9785,It would be nice if you could deliver the problem's solutions after the course ended. I ran out of ideas for the BetterBWMatching problem and i couldn't overcome the time issues.,4
9787,"too complex, and I don't think in the future work I will apply these.",4
9793,"Still stuck at Problem 5 of Week 1, had to left this problem undone.Wondering if the mentors or professors can send those who completed the course the standard/reference solution/program via Email???",4
9795,Course Content is good. Instructors are not that much active to give answers for the raised questions compared to earlier courses.,4
9800,"Nice introduction into string algorithms, even though Ukkonen's algorithm is missing and slides sometimes contain buggy pseudocode.",4
9802,The lectures are a little bit confused,4
9817,"This wasn't quite what I expected. A lot of the ""lectures"" were very repetitive, which was annoying. However, I learned a lot and enjoyed the assignments. The Arch of Titus Project sounds really interesting and I'm looking forward to their next findings!",4
9820,"I really enjoyed this course. It both further my reading and knowledge in some areas, while introducing new topics to me that I'd not yet encountered.My only problem was with the final assignment - it does not do justice to the topic of the final week, which is the issue of colour on ancient monuments (in particular the arch, of course) and the implications of colour on composition and on later perceptions of antiquity. The assignment itself did not give me an opportunity to really explore these issues.",4
9823,"It was a very interesting, insightful and enjoyable course. A lesson of history which I wasn't consider like that before. The passion of Pr. Steven Fine was obvious and strong. Thank you for the opportunity to learn from you.",4
9837,Good for a general understanding of the mainstream theories relating to business strategy and corporate governance.,4
9839,Excellent resource for getting up to speed with some of the challenges that the accountancy profession is faced with. I do however feel that this course and the accountancy profession as a whole needs to the consider the repercussions of rapid technological advancement and how these would impact the profession as a whole. The Accountants of tomorrow will need to be able to delegate the mundance daily tasks associated with financial accounting and bookkeeping etc. and be able to think and act more like business people. The course should also look into this aspect.,4
9841,comprehensive yet a bit too easy,4
9846,Great and interesting,4
9847,"Good refresh of managerial knowledge, especially if combined with my practical experience, thx",4
9850,The course is well-developed to cover key issues that are brought about changes in the,4
9856,it is a very good course to start in android,4
9857,its my first day hope for the best,4
9863,"Nice course, thank you!",4
9872,Great course but can have some improvments,4
9875,its a great course and i learned a lot during this course process and finally created a basic android app .I thought that there should be a tutorial of shared preferences in this course,4
9880,"Very fundamental, if they can talk about some UI design principle, that would be 5 stars.",4
9889,"It is most useful,interesting and important course the basics they are given are very good.",4
9896,I still do not know how to put the application that I created to my phone or make it available to other phones to download.,4
9897,this course was good for every begginner who has no basic understanding about android.. it help me alot to learn the basic,4
9898,"Took the free version of this course to learn some basic building blocks of Android app dev and to dive back into programming, already having Java knowledge from long ago. For my purposes it was a good intro. For a totally new coder this might not be best as there isn't deep explanation of the code itself. But for the rest, it allows you to quickly dive in.",4
9901,"I think it's a great tester course with very good Blocks of code, and these blocks of code are not seen until week 4 and 5. Week 3 was a hands on km to miles, and miles to km app, good hands on. I explored the course, so I'd not do any of the exercises, but did the final assignment from what I suggested I will create in week two. I created a great app, but wasn't able to share it, so i'll put it on github.",4
9904,Good basic course hard to get lost but does require some follow through if things are unfamiliar,4
9908,Very good class. Need to have some knowledge of Java ideally.,4
9913,Nicely targeted for the programmer needing a jump start into Android while having a good base in Java.,4
9918,It is interesting.,4
9921,"Very Good course, simple and deep.",4
9931,"Thank you.This course was very effective for me.It has a lot of details, and I need to review some issues agian",4
9936,"Limited intro course compared to one offered few years ago but still Great start , Thank you",4
9938,"This has been a very helpful course, showing me how to program in a fun way because every coding challenge is linked to a biological question. I think the pace of the course was good, without any prior experience in coding I've had a few moments where I was stuck. But thankfully with some patience and helpful replies from the teaching assistant of the course to my questions in the discussion, it was possible to get past those coding problems.",4
9944,"Really liked the course and love the topic, however the algorithms section was very difficult and could use some more in depth explaining. Without that, I would not quantify it as ""beginner"".",4
9946,"The stepik interactive text was just amazing !! I think it is a great way to teach. Integrating with Code Academy to learn Python was really helpful. I spent quite a bit of time on a few challenges. However, arriving at the solution was very rewarding. As a biologist, it is a good start for first time exposure to bioinformatics and algorithms. There were some concepts I had to read multiple times to understand. Some detailed explanations by earlier students were helpful in a few cases.",4
9949,Very good introductory course to new learners in bioinformatics or students who are just curious about this field.,4
9950,The course was amazing!,4
9951,"I really enjoyed this course, thanks to coursera",4
9960,very challenging course,4
9962,"The course content is highly challenging and that's great for a sense of accomplishment. The biological problems motivates the biologist to go through the abstract mathematical concepts(but I have to admit there is a threshold where the biologist can not get it well anymore(greedy motifs, gibbs ...) and I wonder if he does really need it to be practical with day to day problems with chip array seq selex...)be ready you will struggle hard here",4
9963,"very interesting!, i liked the stepik interactive lesson very much, i prefer them over lectures",4
9966,"Not a bad course, but it is a python programming class. There are some steeper steps at times if you are not used to python. Support can seem distant if you hit one of these steeper steps. It's best to have a coding attitude and not a ""I want to read about biology and genetics"" attitude to approach this class.",4
9967,"A good introduction to computational aspects of bioinformatics. However, the pace of the course might seem too low if you have a strong computer science background.",4
9969,"It's good, but I would prefer that the python was taught within the course.",4
9975,Stepic issues with not syncing progress and assignment completion. All else was good. Well paced.,4
9979,Innovations and creativity have been immersed into my mind through learning the course.,4
9994,Enjoyed it very much,4
10002,Very good overview of modern astronomy. Easy to understand by non native English speaker.,4
10004,Great professor. Simple to understand and made me love astrology... Quizzes are a bit challenging though...,4
10005,"Very interesting course, isn't too geeky and mathematical, unlike many other astronomy courses. The only thing bothering me was the inability to learn the correct answers and explanations to quiz questions. Some of those were rather mindboggling.",4
10019,"As a quick overview to modern astronomy and cosmology this is a very worthwhile course. Highly informative and well presented. Material is detailed enough to provide an understanding of the topics covered and hints at more complexity to encourage further exploration.Marked down to four stars solely on the basis of the review questions. Some of these are ambiguous or have a lack of clarity. Otherwise this course, given the level and time allocation, would rate 5 stars.",4
10020,This course provided a great overview of Astronomy. I thought the difficulty was about right for a survey course and recommend it to anyone who wants a better understanding of how we think the universe came to be and what we think will happen to it.,4
10024,"The course lives up to its title. We indeed confront the ""big questions"" of modern astronomy: where did the universe come from, what is it made of, what is its future. The presentation is lively and engaging. Relevant topics are touched upon just enough to understand how to approach each question, without any feeling that dense physics is being discussed, as befitting the ""highlights"" term in the course title. The course structure is very enjoyable and illuminating, and the weekly exercises are superb. Highly recommended.",4
10025,Good overview of the topic. Inspiring lecturer. No need for any complicated math. Having a background in physics on advanced high school level should probably be enoughto pass this course.,4
10027,Professor explains concepts well.,4
10036,The lectures provided by the Professor were very much insightful and helpful. Especially the interview videos of the C level executives were great. Had lot of information and the exams were fun to answer.,4
10041,I love the interview parts.,4
10042,"I came across many new concepts and the articles shared were useful. However, It was not very challenging like Pricing Strategy - which is understandable. Nice course",4
10047,Not as complete as the two first courses of the specialization but still good.,4
10051,The instructor was hard to understand at times.,4
10052,great course about distribution channels,4
10054,A great course! Of course I will recommend it.,4
10060,"info good, photos way too small, would be nice if they were full screen",4
10064,"Great course, but there is a problem with 2 of the exams not accepting correct answers.",4
10066,This was a very interesting course. I only wish it could be made deeper and extended a bit!,4
10069,Great media support (video and Interact Book) with teacher's quality for explanations and course's structure,4
10070,This rating system seems to be broken,4
10073,Excellent Presentations! Answers for Quizzes are typically not provided in the lectures and extremely hard to find in the textbook or challenging to enter.,4
10076,"This is a very good course. The material is formatted in a way that is very digestible even for those without a strong science background. Some of the quiz questions are harder than they should be, and challenging to locate the correct answer to. And it is not immediately clear that in order to pass the course a student must read the book the course is based upon. There are some spelling errors that should be corrected, and a few errors in the filmed dialogue. But the information contained in the course is good.",4
10085,Displaying handson queries graphically would make it more appealing as it was in Neo4j,4
10090,"Very interesting class, large applications possibilities, unfortunately the hands on machine wont work properly",4
10091,The concepts are brilliantly taught but the technical part that was programming was rushed through and not explained step by step. This is probably out of scope for this course but would have been good to get a little more technical training,4
10092,Thanks so muchyou are great people,4
10093,"The neo4j parts were good, and nice introduction to graph terminology and concepts. would like to see detailed hands-on for wk#5 (like wk#4 had w/neo4j, which was very well done). like the tools survey and concepts. would like to see recommendations for other course(s), not necessarily in this series or by UC SanDiego, about where to go for deeper math.",4
10098,"Very good material, very good Neo4j hands on for new comers. The critique goes to the coverage of GraphX hands on which, at least to me, is not explained clear enough",4
10110,best course of the series,4
10111,"Maybe the best course of all the specialisation. Good balance between theory and hand-ons. I would give the fifth star with more details and explanations in some hand-ons (mainly the ones from the last lesson). In summary, a good introductory course to graph analysis.",4
10113,"Great course. The reason I did not give it five stars because I thought the last week of the course was not up to par with the first 4 weeks. The lessons on Giraph and GraphX were confusing in my opinion and the hands on exercise did not really clear things up for me. Otherwise, a great course.",4
10114,interesting practices with neo4j,4
10118,Very interesting course if you want to learn about inner workings of distributed systems. Lecturer was very knowledgeable and provided good examples. Exams and quizes were pretty challenging and fun. I love that there was a practical programming assignment. I would only suggest to tweak the template for programming assignment as it was a little bit limiting. And maybe allowing for different programming languages other than C++.,4
10122,"Overall I really enjoyed this course, and I think I learned a lot, so thank you!However I think there were some things that could be improved.Firstly the quality of the code provided for the programming assignment was very low. It contains a lot of things that are far from modern c++ best-practices (e.g. using raw arrays instead of std::vector, mixing malloc and new, using new where there is no reason to use it, using raw pointers when references would be fine, missing consts, macros, ...). There were also some relatively minor bugs: the first log message doesn't print with the correct prefix, and the grading script as provided doesn't run (IIRC it was because the #! isn't on the first line). Since this course could be some people's first introduction to C++ I feel that it's important to set a good example, and to keep the code simple and safe.Secondly the symbols used for things were often inconsistent between slides, which was occasionally confusing but should be easy to fix.Despite these issues I still think this is a great course, it just could be a little bit better.",4
10123,"GREAT course ,the concepts and theories have been explained thoroughly. But I also believe providing a few reference materials would have been better for a theory oriented course like this one.overall still the best could theory course online",4
10125,"Great course! I learnt basics of current cloud computing technologies, even this is really tough course.",4
10132,Very good intro to a number of distributed computing topics. Challenging assignment and engaging material.,4
10133,"The contents cover a vast set of topics. just what i was expecting. I was hoping some good books, papers would be suggested",4
10134,Good introduction to the concepts.,4
10137,"Great lectures. However, the starter code for the programming assignment is quite atrocious. Overall, would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn high level concepts in distributed systems.",4
10145,"The programming assignement was very long in relation with the resto of assignements (quiz). However, the course's content is very interesting and complete.",4
10147,Nice Course with Nice Tasks.,4
10150,"The course introduces many cloud computing concepts, and briefly highlights the trending technologies. It is a good starting point for the beginners, it also contains a set of challenging quizzes and final exam, one could not pass unless s/he masters the course contents. finally there is the programming assignment which would not sound easy until you pass it.",4
10151,Very difficult programming assignment if not an expert.,4
10153,"The course gave me an interesting overview of different problems from the cloud computing field. The course start looks little bit slow, but later it gets more interesting. However I was disappointed with code quality of the assignment framework.",4
10156,"Great, and highly relevant/topical, content. However I found the quiz assignments to be needlessly tedious at times.",4
10160,Great course but the main problem is that very little help is available. Programming assignment is not able to understand meaning not able to find how to start (what should be the first step?)pace is little fast. learned a lot about Cloud Computing. Homeworks are really challenging.,4
10164,"I enjoyed the contents and homeworks. Overall the delivery was very good, and I have grasped a lot.The main reason that I won't give 5 stars is the program assignment. I have spent and wasted 3 weeks to work on the tools, yes, tools, not the subject matter. Course should clearly indicate that the assignment only works in Linux/UNIX environment, and need to further test the scripts in most popular Linux OS platforms, different c++ versions, and different python versions.",4
10172,"It's a great course, but the assignments are kind of annoying.",4
10180,"Very simple yet comprehensible, this course has helped me understand complex subjects and apply them to simple things such as real day to day activities or decisions. Thanks Dr. Gershenson",4
10189,I found the background given for the writing of the bible very interesting and gave me a whole new perspective on Hebrew Scriptures.,4
10207,Very Good Introduction to Environmental Chemical Exposure,4
10213,Curso bastante básico de Ruby on Rails.,4
10217,"Great online course, really learned some new technics - others got refreshed. Looking forward to start my own venture using this course as the first buildingstone.",4
10219,Gives an overall idea of being an entrepreneur!Good MOOC :),4
10222,Very Good Course and the Professors explained the material very well. Thanks,4
10225,"Good course, the ideas are organized , some many real example have been explained. I recommend this course for all people who have ideas in their minds.",4
10232,Definitely helpful. Highlights the most important points very quickly and succinctly. Would have wanted a little more detail and examples which is why I withhold the 5th star.,4
10236,Cloud Networking (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) is a great class,4
10243,"This was an excellent short course about key issues and solutions for data center networks. We read important papers on topics including data center network design, congestion handling schemes and network virtualization. The programming assignment were very helpful and gives one an appreciation of the power that SDN brings in programming a network through writing a few lines of code (and not having to CLI into switches to change configurations). I learnt alot from this course.",4
10247,The video lectures were excellent. So much so that I wish they covered more of the material rather than relying on reading academic papers. Thanks!,4
10250,I find the course a very good summary of brand management with focusing on important concepts and definitions.I would like if the professor elaborates more on the Lemonade business example. That would give me a better understanding of how to apply in practice the brand and product management concepts discovered throughout the course.,4
10252,The course (videos and especially teacher) are very well done and I've enjoyed that however in my opinion the content is more for marketing beginners and doesn't go much in depth.,4
10263,"good learning,",4
10267,VERY THEORETHICAL. NEED TO HAVE MORE IMAGES OR MAPS OTHERWISE CAN GET BORED WITH THE GUY SPEAKING.GOOD LENGTH OF VIDEOSGOOD REAL LIFE EXAMPLES,4
10271,I found this course very effective and helpful. Hope it will help others too in understanding Marketing approaches that are explained very well.,4
10276,better accent clean verbal this is how every course should be slow and steady,4
10285,"Brand and Product Management is one of the most useful marketing courses provided by Coursera, and it gives me a better sense of marketing.",4
10308,Great course for Branding Insights!,4
10310,A very innovative course explained in simple lucid language with the help of lemonade business. Prof. Baptista has very amazing technique of conveying the concept with practical examples. A course worth doing if you aspire to get into the world of management.,4
10311,"Overall, great course. The contents are meaningful and useful. IE's widely recognised expertise comes through all",4
10316,"Great course with solid content and concepts, i definitely recommend it.I didn't gave a 5 star review only because i felt that more examples were needed on module 4.",4
10320,"Thank you for the course, I like the examples and the quantity of the information very much. The thing I miss about this course is how to do the metrics that the professor recommends to do at most of the steps of most processes.",4
10323,The depth of the topic taught is really amazing,4
10326,Very good material with more than enough detailing on the subject. Wish it could have more practical examples and exercises.,4
10338,"A course that provides an overview of the challenges faced by sustainable development efforts, and the processes the MAPS programme practices to effectively tackle them. I wish I could have access to the detailed ""models"" that were a main topic to more deeply understand the kind of effort that goes into creating and adjusting them, and how they then translate into affecting policies.",4
10346,It explains the issue of how developing countries are facing climate change and on that aspect it presents the information not only the way they deal with it but the obstacles they encounter in the process. It also introduced very interesting concepts that could be used outside of this course.,4
10349,If people can mitigation a climate change the world will be solve the problems . I hope this course can make me clear about climate change in the world . why's climate change ? what's the problems ?,4
10356,Good knowledge sharing for a beginner.,4
10357,Very informative course. Thanks Coursera and Yonsei university for this course.,4
10363,"Excellent content, but it would be better if the quizes didn't need payment.",4
10366,Excellent work done on presentations. Nicely explained.,4
10368,Its awesome....and fantastic course,4
10369,Content delivery is very good and to the point.,4
10379,"That is a excelente course to start and comprehend more about big data and the current technologies about Cloud Service, Map Reduce. HADOOP, etc.",4
10383,"Very informative session ,specially BIG DATA part",4
10407,easy way to learn fields outside of my own in short amount of time,4
10411,"Wonderful course, giving a valuable insight into the latest technologies. Had the course delved a little more into the depth then it would have been a perfect corse!",4
10415,Really nice course to clear the concepts regarding the new existing technologies and all the related terms. The tests and mid lecture questions really helped in testing the grasp of the course.,4
10421,Repeating slides,4
10424,I liked CDN course very much.,4
10425,A very basic course for Cloud and Big Data. For a laymen its good choice to cover all basics but not for a technical person.,4
10428,I know about cloud,4
10429,"Good, may be we can have some more real world examples.",4
10435,Course is very light and very informative. Professor gives enough information for future study. Thank you for the hard work and simplifying those very complicated topics.,4
10437,"Nice introduction to the technologies , I am very thankful for efforts of entire team that make this introductory course .Thank You",4
10440,"Good explanation, Less material.",4
10441,great course for a general overview (plus plus) of the subject(s).clear and accessible. can help you get in the subject..,4
10443,Great Slides! The slides were good enough to pass the exam.,4
10448,useful and short,4
10449,"while being informative, and a decent course, it does require some knowledge of databases and networking.",4
10454,nicely articulated !,4
10455,for a beginner this course is very good and provide good basic knowledge related to cloud computing and others..thanks for the course,4
10458,"This course was very knowledgeable but it didn't hads anything to use in practice, no coding and only theory. However it was very good.",4
10459,Good course to learn basics of cloud computing and CDN.However Big Data part needs to be more elaborate.,4
10460,Good learn,4
10462,the lecture just reading the ppt than extend it,4
10463,Its good as an introductory course,4
10468,"Awesome... Very helpful in building concepts in knowledge in big data,cloud computing and CDN.",4
10470,Map Reduce needs more crisp explanation. Too much content explained in short slides. Scope for improvement,4
10472,While testing the questions should be increased.,4
10473,"Very good for understanding basic overview of Big Data Hadoop, Cloud computing and CDN.",4
10474,"Well done for a short course, I learned a lot.",4
10475,Very Useful,4
10476,"For a beginer, this is a very good starting point.. I am loving the contents and enjoying my learning..",4
10477,This course was good but from practical side I was not able to learn anything. That thing lacked in this course.,4
10479,It is a good introductory class. You do not need any programming or math background to take this class.,4
10485,Wish those courses would be longer. I'd really like to learn more about CDNs.,4
10487,"Cloud Computing and CDN courses were perfect. However, Big Data details was not very clear to me, the general idea was clear though.",4
10491,good to have a brief knowledge,4
10495,It was very good and basic course. It would be great if its next part can also describe these technologies in detail and with hands-on experience.,4
10496,"Its a great course, Gives you a detailed explanation on what is cloud computing and the different types of various services and its current usage in the market.I would recommend this course to all the people who want a vivid clarity on what is cloud and bigdata.",4
10498,good corse,4
10502,"Quite an interesting view to keep updated, not being deep involved in too technical topics.",4
10503,Great but must be little more interactive and deep,4
10504,Very small and concise course.,4
10506,Pretty good first introduction.,4
10507,The instructor is very easy to understand for international students and the course teaches you the fundamentals and language of cloud technologies. It will be useful for both students and developers to take the course if you feel the need to learn more about these technologies.,4
10511,"Generally pretty well put together. There were more then a few times some of the videos probably should have been combined into one, so as to be less cluttered. Otherwise overall a pretty pleasant experience.",4
10516,"I really enjoyed the course. I hope to see more animal specific behaviour and welfare courses in the future.This course mostly covered parts of the poultry industry, I would have enjoyed it even more if non commercial farming was included, like chickens at home or at the children's farm.",4
10518,Quality information & supplemental info provided! I own chickens and am very interested in animal welfare and I love edinborough's welfare courses.,4
10522,Informative and interesting.,4
10525,"The individual lectures are kept short and the exams at the end of the week felt ""fair"".The course itself is very informative and comprehensive . I learned a lot and I feel somehow ok prepared to keep a few backyard chicken :)",4
10529,Fascinating general information on commercial and backyard chicken welfare and behavior course.,4
10530,"Honestly, I am absolutely delighted to have access to that course. Information is reliable, strong, you can have access to a huge number of articles, studies... It is well structured. My only regret, is that there is a lack of actual images of the actions and the process described.",4
10536,I have learned a lot more about the behaviour and welfare of chickens. Highly recommended for anyone who keeps a few or lots of chickens.,4
10550,"A very informative and interesting course, a good cover of both behaviour and welfare. Each section was explained well, so no background knowledge was required. I appreciated the additional video content to explain concepts. I would have liked a little more information on disease and nutrition but I understand it is difficult to cover everything in a short course.",4
10553,Can be taken by anyone with an interest in chickens! Good references and interesting variety of topics!,4
10556,Very interesting course. Truly enjoyed studying the behaviour of the animals I started appreciating a lot. Nevertheless 4 out of 5 stars because I felt the course is typically focusing on the large scale agro industrial side more then the (increasing number) of small scale/hobby keepers. Also I would have loved to learn more about typical chicken health care issues and how to prevent. All in all very informative and definitely a course I recommend!,4
10562,"This course wasn't the most riveting course in the world however it did help me to further my understanding of chemistry. Most of the topics had already been taught to me at school but considering I go to an English school, the ability to approach something from an American point of view was a new experience. This was definitely a useful, informative course which has allowed me to approach content from a new perspective.",4
10577,This course is quite best for a student want to learn basics properly.👏👏🌟,4
10585,"Very thorough, easy to stay self-motivated with the clear objectives and accessible lectures. Occasional demos were a treat!",4
10589,Very good course with knowledgeable professors.,4
10592,"It's a great course, but some of the questions could be improved. Many of the questions were too lacking in content.",4
10599,I love this course,4
10601,Well explained and a lot of questions to practice.,4
10606,"A very informative ,interesting journey through the world of chemistry",4
10614,good course!,4
10615,Learnt More Here Than I Did At My College!!,4
10620,The course is very insightful and very helpful for the data mining studies at university courses.,4
10625,"Some of the multiple choice questions are _really_ more opinion than fact - making it almost impossible to get them ""right""",4
10635,This course was much better than the previous one in the series.,4
10639,A very interesting course focus on the true life with data science teams. This course is more about the day to day life and problem to manage a data science team and less about pure organization. The financial aspects are not covered by Jeff nor the complex problems of people organization. I have noticed that I was the sole person to post on the forum.,4
10645,"Good overview of the roles and skills needed, but loses a little momentum when it gets into the team management side of things, which is covered in many other business courses.",4
10648,Good overview of forming Data science team. The challenges are typical of any SDLC project. However I was looking to glean some specific challenges between DSc team and product or marketing teams.,4
10649,"Very useful for learners who do not have a background in Data Science or, Software engineering",4
10653,Easy to understand and very valuable,4
10654,"Good pointers but not a lot of unique new insights. A lot of this is based on building any team, not unique to Data Science",4
10655,"Short, well organized, and very useful. Perhaps quizzes could be improved in order to address more relevant topics. Thanks!",4
10659,Excellent Certification course on Team and deliverable management related to Data Science.,4
10661,Material presented was succinct and easily understandable.,4
10678,too pricy,4
10680,"A good, enjoyable course with some interesting additional reading. I think I would have preferred a little more detail/content to have given it a full five stars. That said...I am very happy to have taken and passed the course. Thank you all involved. Now on to 'Managing Data Analysis'!!",4
10682,This course gave me good insight about building a data science team that can be easily related to my work environment.,4
10686,"I will like a little more of excersices, ""real""/""simulate"" problems.",4
10693,good insights and ways to avoid problems in building and importantly advertising your team,4
10697,"This is a great course and a daring venture for what is really an art form, beyond it's scientific requirements. This part of the specialization needs a little refinement.I posted this in the discussion forum.· 7 days ago · EditedFirst of all.....these guys running this data science department have their hands full. They are teaching live classes for students who have spent OODLES (lots) of money to attend this prestigious college . Johns Hopkins is about as good as it gets for a medical degree. Then they are doing experiments and other data science for the research division of Johns Hopkins which is also as good as it gets........THEN they are doing these MOOC courses on top of all their other responsibilities......Dr. Leek is a University of Washington Alumni, which is also top notch for Data Science.The video lesson is flawed, there is no denying it. But I must say these teachers are very open to improvement in the course and your comments on what could be better done are received and acted upon, so I would include them in your thank you letter to the teachers.ALSO I think these MOOC courses are best done by all members of the department contributing. Truly this field IS a team sport. I feel this course was good, but the videos need to be edited and scripted, so unnecessary language, which dilutes the core knowledge, that must be learned, is not diluted where questions are left in the students head about content when being tested. I learned long ago in a college calculus class that if your mark isn't perfect, it's OK, so long as you pass with a high score......even if it is the teachers fault. The course could use better video production with teleprompter scripting......maybe some AV students at Johns Hopkins could get on board. it will happen eventually I'm sure.You want to take a course that is absolutely one of the best courses I've taken anywhere and truly the best online. Try the number one business course on Coursera:GROW TO GREATNESS, either part 1 or 2, University of Virginia, Darden School Of Business...........A team created course with one helluva a teacher who is a business person, researcher and award-winning writer. I would recommend this course to ANY student and especially E-Teachers.The problem with this course is that there is a lot of information that can be included but may not be absolutely necessary as a ""core concept"". Needless to say, the more technical skills any employee has, the more insight they will have into their teammate's skills, as well, as the overall mission of the data department and the business it serves. I'm more of a tech and infrastructure person, I'm not real passionate about coding. I find it tedious. The more I learn about it, the more I enjoy it, albeit, from a distance. I can't see myself creating great blocks of scripts, but the more I know about how they are created AND what rules the code in a project must abide by, the better my skills will be as a data center manager. So I'm trying to learn as much as possible about R, Python, and companion programs like ggvis for creating visualizations. I'd say visualizations are an essential skill for a data manager, since you have to present results and projects, questions, and answers to higher ups and other departments.this link comes from the resource section of this course:https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorialThis link or URL is of much more value to me, than a flawed test question and a reduction in my 100 percent average in the specialization.Without this lesson, in this course, I would not have this valuable resource.Another great link, which has a great FREE print publication as well:http://www.processor.com/ ...these people have been advising data center managers longer than just about anybody !Verbally and in the transcript are some nebulous statements that point toward the main idea, that concept being: the more any employee, on any data science or technical team member IS, a ""jack of all trades"", the better. So that could have been included in some more general way on the quiz, because really that is pretty much a general rule, I've found, working in ANY capacity in the tech industry. I have done a great deal of audio editing, working at numerous radio stations, with Adobe Audition. With others like: Pro Tools, or any other really good quality AV digital editor the result is streamlined, near seamless, audio-video, or one or the other. You just learn how to read and edit wave forms of all kinds.Years ago, in Dallas, Texas, attending Richland College. I learned a valuable lesson. I was taking a college level Calc-Trig math class being taught by the regular professor's WIFE. I don't know if the professor was sick, but this woman, who was teaching the class for the whole semester, frankly, was not qualified. I had always been considered an illiterate by my high school math teachers, a married couple who, frankly, were highly abnormal even on the geekiest scale. These people were acting like they were a world above most people in the class. Needless to say, I assumed, by their ""adult"" opinions, they were sent by God Himself, to educate me thru denigration.I was amazed, how 10 years later, in College math how well I was doing. I was carrying a 100 percent average ! So midterm this faux professor declares, ""I'll be prefiguring all the arithmetic to be easy, so you won't have to bring your calculators !""SO I DIDN'T.......and of course the teacher's wife proclaims.....""I didn't have time to make the arithmetic easy so you'd better use your calculators !"" I literally had pages and pages of figuring in handwriting accompanying my 3 page test. The result was a C plus on the test. I angrily told the sub teacher ""I did not bring a calculator to this test because you said it wouldn't be necessary, therefore I must be allowed to redo this test with a calculator !"" She of course relented, ""No that won't be possible...that's not a bad grade...."" she continued, ""what are you worried about ?""........I was so peeved, I was going to drop the class. It was too late in the semester, and I was so disgusted with this woman's cavalier dismissal of my perfect grade that I just stopped going to class. The result was a failing final grade.Who ultimately suffered from this dilemma ? That, albeit, unfairly was me.....who created this ""academic"" tragedy, by the aggravation of a deeply flawed situation. Once again, that would be me.",4
10703,"Good but should come after the Managing Data Analysis for understanding better what the people you hire are actually going to do. Preventing the ""Dilbertification"" of the data science manager.",4
10704,Gives a good overview for newbies in the field and provides a few great link,4
10706,"Useful information indeed, but still running into some disconnects between the course material and the tests, which is definitely very frustrating.",4
10707,Great for a someone who wants to build or invest in a data science team.,4
10711,I have studied this course as part of the Executive Data Science Specialization. I think this set of four courses meet my objectives by providing a very nice overview on the key points of data science projects. They are good to give a flavor on data science and data science projects helping decide if you want to search for more in depth knowledge.,4
10715,"This class had hard quiz.Sometimes it seemed very basic, but some are hard unless you read and learn really well. Great class/knowledge. Practical real-life examples help.",4
10717,"I think the questions in this course do not map as well as they could to the lectures. But, overall it's very helpful.",4
10719,A good overview on how to build and manage data science teams.,4
10721,"Gives a good idea of the roles required to build a competent team, dispelling the myth of the all encompassing data science guru",4
10724,Good overview on the roles and how to align expectations.,4
10726,Expensive course.Good for how to find a team.,4
10730,"I really enjoyed this course and I have found a lot of similarities with issues and challenges that I face every day at work. This has been very useful to me bot as a way to get inspired on new ideas and techniques, and as a way to confirm what I am already doing.However, there were few occasions where I found the quizzes not to be clear enough.In some instances this was due to the fact that the question asked required some extra knowledge that couldn't possibly be achieved only by reading the course material or listening to the class. I was lucky I new the answers because of my personal experience but it seemed quite unfair in my opinion. Also lectures materials are very short and don;t provide any extra information.In other cases, the answers, especially when there were multiple answers didn't seem to be clear enough and sometimes contradicting what I had listened in the class. I don't remember specific cases at the moment, however I have left feedbacks throughout the course. You should have my feedbacks where I mentioned specific questions that in my opinion were confusing.Hope this helps,Giacomo",4
10733,"Ver good with clear and on point material. I would suggest to include real life stories of success and failure some managers had in building a data science team, and discuss about the mistakes or the strengths of their recruitment process.",4
10735,Covers theory of basics for building the team very well.,4
10736,Topics are explained pretty good,4
10738,Good overview of the different roles and skills needed for the roles of a data science team.,4
10743,Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject. Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work. I get the feeling this is quite a new course (compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization) and does not have the student interaction base yet. I hope this aspect develops - perhaps even with the TAs. For this level course student interaction could be even more valuable than the more hands on data science subjects. Hope this specialization takes off as well as the DSS did!,4
10749,it is very good course but need more case presentation.to be more clinical more than academic part.,4
10770,Very well informed.,4
10775,"The course was great for the most part. The material was more challenging than previous courses in the specialization and really helped me pull everything together and understand everything a bit better. I will say that I felt there was a huge gap between what was taught in the Neo4j course and the Neo4j assignment in the Capstone. I'd learned a lot from the assignment, but it took me loads of time and their were parts I still don't really understand. There are also a some broken hyperlinks to previous course material. I'd also like to see better support for a paid service. There is no interaction from a Coursera employee or course instructor in the forums at all. It would be nice to have someone to clarify some instruction or material that may not be clear at times.",4
10784,"The method of delivery is a bit conservative, dry and boring but matter wise, it was really comprehensive and easy to understand. Good beginner course.",4
10785,Interesting material! It is really useful to understand the basic of Chinese phylosophy.,4
10789,A good course that gave me a good refresher on at least what I grew up with decades ago. It also introduced me to two that I am aware of but have not read them. I especially like 王阳明 whose philosophy I resonate with. I checked out his work 传习录 from public library thereafter and am a firmer believer in how I would continue to conduct my life working with others.无善无恶心之体 有善有恶意之动知善知恶是良知 為善去恶是格物,4

10840,good information shared,4
10853,"this course is pretty thorough as far as data sampling goes. The professor is clearly very well versed in the statistical methods. This course is mainly about statistical methods used in the field of biodiversity, so at the end, you will have to use the formulas mentioned in lectures (without any worked examples), so if you are not comfortable with calculus, it's not for you. The transcripts are helpful but often incomprehensible.",4
10855,Subs are not always understandable.,4
10856,"At this point of time, when the climate change has gained pace and we are in a different world with erratic and unpredictable climate, it has become essential for us to set right the ecological balance, which is possible only by better understanding of biological diversity.",4
10857,A very interesting and clearly presented course. I would recommend this course anyone who is interested in the study of biodiversity.,4
10862,"Very nice, quick overview. Formulation of equations in Biology leaves a bit to interpretation but this is a systemic issue. The guy is obviously highly proficient and comfortable with the subject matter never falters in his delivery. Assignments are all quizzes and the whole thing can be completed without undue pain.",4
10868,Nice approach to manage chronic pain,4
10870,"Overall, great work. The course creators did superb job. My only recommendation is that the questions should be more challenging. Even thought its an introduction course, course participants should be challenged. We should have individual and group work components attended to the course.Deeqo Godax",4
10875,Informative and easy to digest content that leave students with a better grasp of the challenges that children's rights advocates run into in the past and today. Course content is modern enough to discuss sexting and whether it infringes on the rights of a child.,4
10876,"i would like to thank all the persons who were involved in the implementation of this course, it was very helpful for my work in the child protection field.",4
10881,"Thank you for a highly challenging, interesting and varied course. I have learned a lot which will be helpful for my work, but also personal interest in this area. I did have difficulty sometimes understanding what was said in the lectures (technical issues) and also I thought some of the quiz questions were not correct. They seemed to contradict what was said in the lectures. Otherwise, it was an excellent course and one I would recommend.",4
10886,"After finishing week one I am inclined to say that the course is compared to other courses labour intensive. The content is consistent, well structured and up to the point. However, the level of English of nearly all speakers is more than poor. Most of the lectures are read of the paper. The subtitles do not help to mitigate misunderstandings resulting from the poor language. Instead, it magnifies the problem (e.g. naming the ""PISA-test"" as ""pizza""). Also the power-point slides hold many mistakes, e.g. in the formatting. Even the quiz questions are not free of mistakes and are misleading or grammatically incorrect or even hold incomplete sentences. Very annoying. Overall, the finalizing of the course was not done with due diligence.",4
10889,Dr Wentzlaff is an excellent instructor and explains the material very well. Homework and tests are well designed: the questions are fair and they help you further your understanding of the material.Only complaint is that some of the lecture video had out-of-sync audio which was distracting.Thank you Dr.Wentzlaff and staff!,4
10895,"This course was a very helpful for filling in gaps in my knowledge between high level software development and details of processor architecture and instruction sets (MIPS mainly). I didn’t have the exact prerequisites for this advanced course so it was hard work especially at the beginning (hadn’t done the earlier architecture course recommended and am not an electrical engineer, but have trained and worked in software development and physical sciences). The concepts are not unduly difficult but the course is VERY detailed and the sheer volume of recommended reading somewhat overwhelming: I got by with buying a Kindle version of the Hennessy and Patterson text book (plus a few peeks into a digital logic book). I appreciated Prof Wentzlaff’s insights: he was clearly teaching from experience.The course is however not really designed bottom-up for online teaching. The lectures are videos of actual Princeton lectures, with a few multiple choice questions hacked in. It helps to keep a copy of the slides when watching as when the camera pans out it is difficult to read the diagrams on the board.The course homework was quite difficult, even after the brief solutions were given. The mid-term and final tests exams were however well constructed and instructive and much clearer as to what was required. So all in all a real bargain for the cost of a text book!",4
10914,"The course was really good. They give you idea what's proper way to use business language. However, it's hard to get professional feedback from the peer-graded assignments.",4
10920,Very useful. I am less afraid of socialising at business events.,4
10923,I think the course is very well organized and provides great ideas. I enjoyed doing the exercises and quizzes.,4
10943,The knowledge gained is enlightening and life transforming. Thanks so much to all the the lecturers and everyone who participated in the put together of this awesomely amazing course program.,4
10953,It's a very useful for all beginners and intermediate professionals.Keeping Learning! Good luck to all.,4
10961,useful but a little esay for me,4
10964,It's a very nice course for students who are just starting to enter the workforce and the vocabulary is very useful for everybody.,4
10969,"It is one of the most useful course from Courser, and it significantly help me improve my business English skill.",4
10986,Very interesting but perhaps not as in-depth as I would have ideally liked. That being said I learned quite a lot and would encourages others to undertake this course of study as well.,4
10989,The course,4
10994,Very good course. Entertaining videos that keep your attention throughout and clearly outline and explain good practices for mentoring teachers. Highly recommended.,4
10999,"I really liked the course. Why only 4 stars? The references are missing, it's hard to validate the studies that are cited without having a bibliography.",4
11008,"Interesting: old Chinese professor speaks good English, class kind of short.",4
11016,Very interested information but I thought that the focus was for other thing instead a guitar amplifier,4
11023,"The course was very enjoyable, nevertheless I would have expected to learn a little more about sound acoustics. The complementary exercises were helpful towards the understanding of the subjects, especially for the electronics parts.",4
11027,"As a retired EE this was a fun course for me to take, but it does cover a lot of territory quickly. I really liked the more practical aspects of the course",4
11030,"For me, this is a very complete course, in my opinion it will be better for the students if you give to us a pdf documentation.I have a digital notebook, so I want to follow the class with the slide in my notebook, but, in general, is a great course.Thanks for taking your time reading this commentGreetings from Mexico",4
11034,Great way to learn the science behind my passion,4
11041,"For someone without a couple of years of college or a technical school this could be way over your head. To much to learn in a short period of time. By eliminating all the basic engineering math tutorials and very simple circuit analysis the course would be more focused. It should be a prerequisite to have finished a pre-calculus course to allow for more in-depth presentation of the engineering material, especially the acoustics. However, it does cover a lot of the basics for understanding music engineering. I look forward to part two.",4
11045,Very informative course. I like the ocntent of it and how it progresses through it. However I think it can improve in termms of practical examples on the differences when changing values of parameters.,4
11049,A very good Course!!,4
11050,Good course for audio enthusiasts. A compilation of basic electric circuits and audio waves.I enjoyed very much. Would be great if lecture notes were provided.Thanks,4
11059,I like this innovation in the education. This course is really good job and teachers are awesome!,4
11061,Good overview of what makes blended learning different from just using technology with in-depth looks into the different configurations. The most helpful part was seeing the different models at work in different and unique schools that are each making it their own and taking ownership to build their schools as they want to.,4
11063,"Very interesting and motivating course, thanks a lot for it.Only one star less because all the videos i've seen shows lots of computers in closed areas, lacks connection to another ""real world"": nature, plants, animals, rocks, sports ... and everything that can be learned at school. I love blended learning, and i would like to have more examples ""outdoor"" to be totally convinced and inspired...",4
11066,This Course is good. I got a lot of insight in doing the blended learning model and apply that in my class.,4
11071,"+ Very clear explanations+ All the examples from real schools were so helpful and stimulating+ Inspiring(-) Too much focussed on teachers. I did this course because I'm interested in education, but all the assignments were meant for real classroom activities (and yes, they provided alternatives; however I personally didn't think that would've helped me get into the knowledge deeper. Also, I did a lot of assignments for schools when I was studying Educational Sciences, and it's almost impossible to contact a school and do an activity/research there within 4 weeks, so for me it wasn't possible to fulfill the practical assignments) Shouldn't we work together in education, teachers, policy makers, educational scientists etc. Too bad this course was so much focussed on teachers.(-) Too much focussed on the US. Please explain local settings and terms better. Took me a few weeks to figure out what was meant by 'K-12'",4
11077,"Great introduction to lots of different blended learning styles, and tons of resources for further study",4
11078,I am glad I took up this course and it did help me in having a better insight of what blended learning is! Thank you to all the profs and the team!,4
11087,The theories and the cases give me deeply impression. I think the course is very useful and grounded.,4
11092,Great Class! many different new ideas to wor,4
11093,"I found this part interesting and useful. While I have been doing most of these things already in the course of planning and writing content, this MOOC has given me more clarity. The peer reviews and discussions are very useful; some of the ideas shared are really good.",4
11094,Social media IMC and IBM interview was amazing,4
11095,"Very useful, practical and with real-world scenarios.",4
11100,"Good course, but the assignment was underwhelming compared with the other courses.",4
11101,Interesting material,4
11108,"I felt like this course gave me a better understanding of why data is so important. I took this class as a way to gain better knowledge of marketing analytics in order to help my non-profit in which I volunteer be more successful and I hope that I can share the knowledge with them so that everyone can be successful. Ducks Unlimited is the organization that I volunteer for. They have a very ""old way of thinking"" approach when it comes to marketing and, while it takes a lot to listen to its volunteers, I think if I share what I learned with them, hopefully they will listen to the volunteers, specifically this volunteer on how to make things better. I would have given this course five stars, but I felt that in Week 3, some of the test questions were difficult because I had not taken MOOCs 1-3 and wasn't aware there was an order to these courses. If I had known, I would have taken them in order. Thanks for the tips!",4
11123,relevant contentIt would be nice to add a practical piece e.g. sell social media marketing program to our top management using tools from teh course. it would be 5 stars thenanyway welldone to developers of the course!,4
11126,"Although still very good and insightful, I found that this MOOC was the less strong of the specialization and the three first MOOCs were the ones that taught me the most. Especially, I found this one was missing a peer-to-peer assignment. In MOOC 4 we were told to write various tweets corresponding to different parts of the Maslow's hierarchy. Logically, I assumed that the next peer-to-peer assignment will be about the results and how to interpret them and where to go from there. But no. Furthermore, we could have been asked to prepare a Business Plan to defend the project as taught in this MOOC. No again.",4
11128,Interesting course on the business side of social media marketing,4
11130,Thanks for a better understanding of the business of social media and marketing. The series has really clarified much for me.,4
11131,The course content and delivery ha,4
11133,A lively introduction to the basic theories of Communication Science with a very easy-to-follow approach. I was getting into Journalism at the time I took this course and it has helped me a lot in the acquisition of some fundamental knowledge.,4
11137,"This course is good, however, it seems to much academic without practical experiences or exercises for learners to practice skills and knowledge.",4
11145,"Very good lecture in selected content and presentation (interesting, motivating, concise and precise).The course could improve by providing a written script in addition to the excellent lectures, as this would make summarizing the material and preparing for the tests easier.",4
11146,Give me new perspective in communication science,4
11149,"I love the example stories, very simple and effective. Thank you!",4
11153,Good course. I would like it better if there are more depth in theories and analysis/examples used in lectures are more reflecting social media and the use of more cutting edge innovation in communication technology.,4
11157,"The course explains variety of theories connected with communication science. The lectures included in the course are great and pleasant to watch. However, in my opinion the instructor gives too many information per minute and it's hard to note everything without spending hours analysing the lecture over and over again. Everything else was great!",4
11170,nice teaching,4
11171,"Helpful introduction basic theories and approaches in the Communication Sciences, which were explained clearly for those new to the field.",4
11173,"Intresting and well structured course to give an overview of communication science, inc the history of it. It is not a hands on course to learn something to do but a good introduction course. I did it before going deeper into PR.",4
11179,"The course is an introductory course in the subject. I really want another one which is more focused on the cultural approach, given that we are facing many multicultural challenges in the work environment. Dealing with too much differences could be frustrating. Trying to communicate better then becomes a must. Thank you",4
11190,i think its a good way to introduce someone with little experience to communications science,4

11217,"I am the student of Communication Science in Indonesia. Before join this course, I have studied the introduction of communication science in the 1st semester of my lecture. But I have still no idea what communication is. This course is so helpful for me to learn the basic of communication.",4
11223,"Great course, very well presented. I had never really thought about communication in science terms and this course has been very valuable in bringing my knowledge up to speed",4
11225,I didn't like the fact that you could not earn a statement of accomplishment but only a verified certificate.Other than that the course was pretty interesting.,4
11231,I will recommend this course to anyone who would want to start their own business. This course is also part of a start up process for your business to be successful.,4
11237,"I enjoyed the course. very informative, i had taken business classes at school about 7 years ago. the information i had in this course were refreshing and some were also knew giving the time that has elapsed since my graduation",4
11245,"It is good if you are looking for basic information, I did not finish the entire course, I think it was not right for me.",4
11262,"Instructors is very warmly and clearly to give explanation, also this course is valuable for non native speaker to improve their English language skill. It is good course to follow it. Thank you for AE Institute, Coursera Team and lovely Instructors also UPENN.",4

11440,Well understandable INTRODUCTION to med statistics.,4
11451,"-Would highly recommend for anyone looking to quickly get a basis for evaluating statistics and logistics of medical literature. Notes sections after videos are an excellent supplement to the videos (which are not too long), and does a great job of hitting high points.-If I could make 1 change I would expand the test section to explain more tests (logistic regression, etc.)",4
11453,i found the course very helpful and informative and i t helps to critically read and interpret research papers. my only take on it is that there was no responses to questions that i asked the lecturer,4
11465,It's a good course if you want a general overview of the statistics of clinical research. Personally I was hoping for a little more depth in some of the statistical methods. Some links or suggested readings on the methods would be great as we move along the course. Overall a delightful course. Everything is clearly explained. Thank you Dr. Koppler!,4
11470,"Very useful course when you have very little background in statistics. You are taught the basic ideas behind the most commonly used statistical tests. The course really gives you a solid base to understand statistics described in scientific medical articles. Actually, after completing this course I felt confident enough to start doing basic statistical analyses on my own research data.",4
11478,Great course so far..,4
11482,"Great course. Could have been longer, if you ask me. Also there were a few technical bugs. Notifications for assignments could have been clearer too. The system said it would email me when I needed to review peer's assignments, but that never happened.",4
11486,"Really good programme so far, very clear and structured input from a knowledgeable expert, who is nonetheless able to make the topics covered accessible.Tests are a bit tricky though!",4
11498,Thanks for the rich and well conducted course. It was very beneficial for me and I recommended it to my friends.,4

11516,nice but too short.,4
11517,"Very good and clear overview of the diagnosis and characteristics of childhood autism and the assessment and choice of effective evidence-based treatment and education. There is very little about adults with autism, and there is no interaction facilitated between learners or between learners and educators.",4
11539,An intresting course. Lectures are small and very easy to comprehend. The whole course has a great structure and help you learn and remember things!,4
11544,"This course was a good introduction to ASD. I was hoping to learn more about how to best serve students with ASD, but this course was not designed solely for educators. I will now look for a more specialized course in ASD.",4
11547,Very clear and complete for a first approach to the ASD,4
11553,It's a really great class to know about Autism. The information is sufficient as well.,4
11562,"It was excellent, but I expected more feedback in the discussion forums.",4
11565,Good but short course. The statment of acomplishment is unaviable.50$ for short course is a big price,4
11570,"This course was a great overview introduction into ASD. The information was presented so the information was not overwhelming. You begin the course by looking at ASD from a wide-lens down to details. This is recommended for anyone who is interested in learning more about ASD and then to take more details classes as needed. The videos that were part of the course were informative. There was not a lot of discussions nor was this class led by any instructor. I wished it had links to more articles or more in-depth information, especially the weeks on the developmental areas.",4
11571,I'd like to learn a bit more about ASD.,4
11578,very useful course. gave insight into a lot of the issues faced by children with asd. a little more detail would be even more useful.,4
11604,"The course was well laid out, had us tread old ground in a great way (especially with those of us who are already int he field or took the earlier courses in the graphic design specialization) by forcing us to look at the basics as we solved design problems. While it's great that people review (and are even left tips and hints on how to leave a helpful review) I do wish there was some sort of word limit (even a minimal one) for them because oftentimes getting a review like 'Great', or 'Nice' while heartening don't actually help the student learn about what the person liked about their design or what failed.",4
11618,Course should have more homework to drill the appropriate concepts.,4
11622,"Very good course, as all in the specialization, the professor shows a great devotion to getting the students to understand these very complex topi",4
11636,I enjoyed this course. It was great as a review of C++ and an introduction to C++11 for me. The assignments are heavy in graph theory and are non-trivial.,4
11638,"it actually introduced c++11 features to me well,it was my first course on coursera and it is benificial to me in ways .",4
11639,"Great overall introduction to C++ for C programmers. It should be emphasized FOR C PROGRAMMERS.Once you know your stuff and a little bit of Computer Science (data structures and algorithms), this course can benefit you if you never had a formal course or introduction on C++.The instructor is well-versed in the topic and the examples are pretty interesting from a CS point of view.",4
11642,#NAME?,4
11643,"It was great to listen to someone with as much experience as Ira Pohl. I learnt a lot in this course, but it required *a lot* of work on my part. It might still be better than trying to learn totally on your own, but I would have liked a bit more structure and assistance.The slides showed on videos (not available for download in the session I took) could be formatted better. The concepts were presented too superficially, in my view, and the structure was a bit disorganized. The assignments where difficult in part because they weren't stated very clearly, but they were very interesting and were a great way to learn (or review) computer science courses while learning to code in C++.Despite these shortcomings I'm glad I took the course and I'm overall happy with it.",4
11650,The course should have a more detailed analysis of c++,4
11653,Very Nice Course...,4
11660,"The course is good and exercises are not trivial, the teacher speaks very slowly but this is to accommodate not native English speakers and I find it to be fair.The course mixes a bit of graph theory with the teaching of the C++ language and I reckon that to be a good idea as it makes you solving non trivial problems thus stressing the C++ topics covered during the lecture, that would not have been the case if problems were simpler.The only big limit I see in the course is the grading system as the peer-review system does not work very well as the student's preparation is very uneven, you can't expect much more from an on-line course though.To draw a conclusion I had the sense of having learned something at the end of the course, which is rewarding, I really appreciate the work you are doing in striving to provide the best knowledge to everybody, I think it is a small revolution.",4
11662,This could be better if the lectures have more hands on programming examples.,4
11663,"Excellent course. It helps you transition to C++ by understanding the reasons, not just a simple recipe.",4
11667,"The course is good overall but needs more to focus on new things in C++ and not on algorithms. I would recommend this course if you are struggling with C++,it goes throw the basics and tells you how the STL works.The homework are hard and that is a big plus :)",4
11671,This course provides good overview graph algorithms. It is not an extensive C++ course though.,4
11674,"Very good course, the content is great and well organized. The slides with code are a bit of an embarrassment for the University of California. The code is presented on what looks like a power point slide with bullets so the formatting and alignment is totally messed up, and then there are no shortage of typo's and code errors. But, the material is very good and Ira Pohl does an excellent job presenting it.All in all a great course and exactly what I was looking for.",4
11679,Explanation is really Good. Contents could be more elaborate.,4
11682,good course. I hope it can contain more contents.,4
11686,good practical materials which help to better understand the theories from previous courses,4
11690,"This course contained a great amount of information about several systems widely used nowadays for large-scale problems. There were analyses of the inner workings of these systems and their algorithms, as well as simple examples of how they can be used to solve common problems. The only drawback of the course is that the coursework was not significantly challenging and there were no programming assignments, which could give learners an opportunity to experiment with some of these technologies and acquire hands-on experience.",4
11691,The course could use a programming assignment to go along with the lectures.,4
11701,It was a great course although it was not exactly what I expected.,4
11718,It's a great experience that allows creativity to flow that we carry within ourselves,4
11720,"Very interesting! Helped me in term of self-esteem, by realizing that I have inside much more possibilities to discover and embrace whose I totally unknew. Thanks to UNAM and to our tutor Guadalupe Vadilla!",4
11723,The interviews in week 4 is totally worthy to watch,4
11725,"Great Course delivering practicable ideas, Tools and Tipps!",4
11727,It's really good opportunity to learn more about the environment inside the work and how to deal with the problems in a professional way,4
11730,I was assisted in my journey by this course and would recommend it.,4
11737,Very interesting course if you want to learn about inner workings of distributed systems. Lecturer was very knowledgeable and provided good examples. Exams and quizes were pretty challenging and fun. I love that there was a practical programming assignment. I would only suggest to tweak the template for programming assignment as it was a little bit limiting. And maybe allowing for different programming languages other than C++.,4
11743,It make me strong,4
11752,"Well done, very systematic and well selected, well structured, focused analysis supported by appropriate examples, definitions and discussions. Lectures are a little bit dry, but I guess this might be due in part to the nature of the subject! Thank you!Alex Ginev",4
11765,"This was a good introductory course into clinical trials, providing an overview of its principles, features and design. The lectures were good and clear, and the accompanying slides were just as useful. I will admit to being occasionally lost on certain concepts, especially with regards to those which would've normally been covered in the biostatistics class, as Ms. Drye mentioned once or twice -- after all, I believe this is a class which is probably offered in conjunction with others. That notwithstanding, I can now consider myself aptly familiar with clinical trials and what they entail, thanks to this course.I will say, however, that having just 10 questions in the quiz is hardly neither exhaustive nor -- and I suppose this goes without saying -- a true test of a good grasp of the course. For instance, I'd read most of the supplemental material for Ethics (week 4) only to realize that that week's quiz could've been passed using common sense alone. I felt somewhat disappointed by that. And also, while one lecturer was very clear in her presentation and discourse, the other wasn't really; more often than not, I was confused by her sentences.",4
11768,Excelent for understand about clinical trial.,4
11770,great course to refresh my knowledge and update some concepts,4
11773,An excellent course totally recomendable. Very clear and focused.,4
11775,Great work! Thank you.,4
11777,"Clear, precise and very interesting content. I am working with Clinical Trials for 18 month, this helped me to learn about the bigger picture.Suggestion to Course creators: A module focussed on what is a Clinical Trial before we start with module 1 would be extremely helpful.",4

11791,"sometimes they go through important topics very fast ,",4
11792,Good course but I hope if there are readings after each video to improve the understanding of information with more simplifying the content of ethics lesson.,4
11793,The course clearly explains the concepts of clinical trials with great detail. The course was taught in a structured manner and helped me gain knowledge in this field.,4

11815,"I think that, besides lesson 11 and 12, everything was very well explained. I was a bit confused with lessons 11 and 12 since I am not new to econometrics. Perhaps I found it confusing the theory background related to the lessons themselves. Just my opinion, very good course.",4
11818,Short course that's actually mostly theoretical with a bit of R/Excel analysis. This fitted my needs perfectly. My only suggestion is that they should have released more comprehensive notes for the lectures.,4
11822,Steep learning curve. really taxed my thinking capacity. I enjoyed it thoroughly!,4
11823,"Very concise and easy to follow to the end. The linear regression part could be more clear (i.e., with a lecture on the background).",4
11827,"The lectures were good, but I hope more background materials can be released. Understanding the topics needs a relative solid mathematical background. Although having completed the course, I am still confused about some concepts in this course.",4
11829,The course is excellent to learn all the basic stuff needed to master the technique of Bayesian Data Analysis.,4
11831,It is a nice introductory course on Baysian s,4
11833,"I could say , it is the best bayesian stat I ever experience till now.",4
11835,"Good course, but in my opinion misses of lectures/pdf to ease understanding.",4
11849,"from week 3, the learning curve become steep",4
11856,This course has given me some good new insights into perceiving data and has got me started nicely I am very great full.,4
11857,"Pen hard to see against shirt. Was mildly irritating to wait for prof to write out stuff, maybe prewrite it?Went too fast forward for me, would've liked complementary optional material, eg extra quizzes, to help understand and get used to the tougher parts.",4
11859,A good course - recommended.,4
11868,"This course provides the student a profound understanding of the statistics behind the bayesian approach. Also, it gives some intuition for the difference between the frequentist and the bayesian approach, although that part could have been more explicit in my opinion. It would be very helpful to have more examples on the differences in using freq vs bayesian approach, the gains from using bayesian approach, examples of where the freq approach is limiting / misleading in its 'objectiveness'. More 'real life' examples instead of coin flipping examples - although easy to follow - would be very helpful as well, maybe in a consecutive course with applied bayesian statistics?",4
11870,I wish the last week were more explanatory. Although overall now I do have an idea. It's a good course. :-),4
11873,"Very good course, with less emphasis in the videos and more on exercises and critical thinking, the way I like and learn the best. I particularly liked that the lecturer writes on a transparent vertical surface standing between him and the camera, very convenient. For those not so familiar with mathematics, this might hurt a bit but the payoff is super positive.",4
11875,A good course but neither notes nor lectures were not in much details. But still it was worth my time. I strongly recommend it if you want a subtle introduction to Bayesian Statistics.,4
11877,"As a grad student myself, I liked the way this course was presented in short video format and in only 4 weeks. Definitely there are much more to learn about Bayesian Statistics and one can go way deeper, but this course gives the required basic Bayesian knowledge to someone who wants to get familiar in a short time.",4
11881,Unfortunately I could not finish the course in due time. But it is very useful.,4
11882,"A very good course which enlights me the study of bayesian statistics, thank you.",4
11884,Good and simple introduction for Bayesian statistics.,4
11890,"I enjoyed the course. My background is mathematics, but not specifically statistics, though I do have a basic understanding of elementary frequentist statistics. My goal was to understand the fundamentals and uses of Bayesian statistics, having attempted that via a couple of textbooks without much success; this time, I got it!I do have some reservations about the course. Herbie Lee spent a huge amount of time deriving formulas and methods - a few gaps (either hand waving or 'leave it to the student to finish') would have been helpful, I think. This would leave more time for examples and applications. But the course was well worth my time and effort.",4
11894,"There are several things in the course that were able to clear up my understanding. The course instructor responds to more questions than I would have expected as well. The course uses a lot of mathematical notation and it helps to take some time with it but once you get the idea of conjugate priors down you can quickly employ them in your own problems. The course covers conjugate priors for several different likelihoods including the normal distribution and the binomial distribution. Although the derivation of the conjugate priors looks daunting as it is written down, the usage of the priors make Bayesian statistics much easier.This course uses R and Excel but is not a course in either. Most of the computations that are performed for the quizzes are pretty simple and require little skill in R.I am glad that I have taken the course and would take another if provided by this instructor. I plan to reference the materials provided in the future whenever I need a refresher.",4
11896,"A great introduction. I feel like I know a lot more about bayesian statistics now. But I do mostly feel like there is quite a bit I don't know, and while I passed, I feel like there is quite a bit more I need to do to really 'get it'. The professor recommended some books in a discussion forum and I'll be going through some of those next I am sure. I also feel, looking back, I should have had some additional math preparation before starting. The calculus was vaguely familiar but with the pace of the lectures, I felt occasionally lost. I would have found it helpful if there was a quick primer on calculus to know and review at the beginning of the course. All in all great course. Loved the presentation method.",4
11898,"The course is a great introduction into Bayesian statistic analysis. I particularly liked the detailed explanations of where the parameter formulas came from. Also a great thing, in my opinion, was to write the explanations on the glass instead of just displaying the final results. It kind of provided a sense of interactivity and made the material more digestible for a person with not such a strong background in math. It greatly smoothed the learning curve for me and kept interested and motivated to finish the course. In the end the pace accelerated a bit but was still manageable. Four weeks seems a great duration for such a course - not becoming boring and tiring. Honors tests were quite easy, I'd prefer to have a little more challenge. Overall I'd recommend the course for everyone who wants a quick introduction into Bayesian statistics. It provides a solid background for further studies.",4
11899,"The course is nice, the lectures are really clear. Professor Lee is brilliant and he often gives some excellent interpretations of Bayesian results. For example, the classic example of testing for rare diseases is explained in terms of ratio of true positives to all positives. Another example is the explanation of predictive mean for normal models, or the explanation of noninformative priors. They're all clearer than what usually found in many books. The only limit of the course is that it's strictly an introduction, thus very useful topics for applications such as hierarchical models or nonconjugate models are not covered.",4
11915,It was really useful,4
11916,"Very useful, full of important concepts which you can use in any field",4
11932,"It was a great privilege for me to be here, i really benefited from it, it increased my potentials on construction management... Thank you so much..",4
11939,"The course content covers a lot of topics related to practical cost estimation and cost control and the presenters did a good job in relating theory to real life experience examples and they were very engaging.The downside was with the test and quiz questions, there where several errors to what the questions asked in relation to what the actual answers where intended. All the quiz/test section needs an entire overhauled and a detailed reviewed should be undertaking to correct all the questions in relation to the provided answers.",4
11940,"Good Topics, but covered at a very basic level.",4
11942,Very helpful and interesting course...,4
11945,Quite an informative course to take briefly. It was able to shed light on what the thought process for work a data manager must use. Would be great if more real world application on how inter-working the data manager is with the rest of the team conducting the research study.,4
11958,Very practical!,4
11961,"Other than minor technical glitches, excellent way to learn about clinical research, REDCap & general data management principles.",4
11967,Very informational with hands on experience. Highly recommend it to others who are looking for basic courses in clinical data management.,4
11970,Very interesting!,4
11982,Good explanation,4
11983,"I learned a lot of useful information in this course--my first on Coursera--and I'm really excited to see how I will apply the things I learned here in real projects. Although I think that it would be beneficial if the course also required us to submit our code (not just watch and read) and also explain github at least a little, I feel that I am well-primed now to acquire more knowledge of how to make apps in the future. I positively adored the instructor (his accent and way of explanation made it so fun). Thanks, Clement!",4
11989,Great course for people with little or no experience in programming. Clement is great deliverer.,4
11992,Pretty good beginner's cource,4
11996,It is a course that will provide you a start on creating a Mobile App. The subject matter is very well presented and exercises are well thought of. It does give you the glimpse into programming and deployment of the app to your mobile. It does not make you an avid programmer of mobile app. It does brush upon the geo position tutorial. But overall very concise and well thought through topics.,4
12003,"Good examples...a little hokey pokey, but still good to see a good example of the coach in action. The fact that you are required to do a video of your own is not comfortable, but necessary to actually do it and not be intimidated by it!",4
12019,"The course was really helpful.Considering the fact that I was not from security background, it went very smoothly",4
12021,It is an excellent course with good resources. The only problem is that you need to know Java to pass this course. It should have better assignments to evaluate us.,4
12023,Extremely good course. Only drawback is that the assignments cannot really be checked independently.,4
12026,The only downside of this course is Java.,4
12028,"As an introduction to cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular the lectures were top quality, and I returned a number of times to watch certain parts again. Thank you for well prepared lectures and material. The java exercises I found a bit laborous and not exactly matching with the content of the lectures; for someone with a lot of experience in java probably easier, but as I saw in the forum discussions, many java programmers had difficulty finding their way to the solution as well.",4
12029,Good overview of crypto currency. The programming assignments are interesting (can help if there is some support on the forum). overall good program for someone wanting to learn blockchain,4
12032,"This course is a very good introduction to blockchain technology and popular in nowadays Bitcoin currency. However the main disadvantages are assigments which are hard to accomplished because there aren't any tests attached, so you cannot check on your computer whether your solution is good or not and you cannot debug your code to find an issue if it isn't ;)",4
12036,Testing environment for coding assignments was difficult to use to troubleshoot programs for errors.,4
12037,"Liked it very much. The exercises, however, could be better explained in some parts",4
12041,Overall it is a great course. Just think that the assignment could have been break into many smaller sections with a slower learning curve.,4
12043,"Comprehensive and interesting course, covering BitCoin related topics in an easy to comprehend way.One thing that can be improved are programming assignements - it would be much easier if there would be project (Eclipse, IntelliJ, maven, ...) and unit tests provided.",4
12044,Thorough overview of relevant topics.,4
12045,"Very good course, but be prepared to do some non-trivial java programming as part of the assignments.",4
12046,"The theory part is quite good: you get a rather strong in-detail understanding of the technology behind Bitcoin. The Java programming assignments, however, are an organizational disaster.",4
12053,There is quite a bit of material within this course. Having the supplementary book and Princeton online material helped substantially especially when debugging the assignments.,4
12054,Very useful information about bitcoin and blockchain in general.,4
12055,Good course but I found it a little difficult to follow. The prof. speaks very fast. It becomes a little uneasy to follow the slides and I need to pause the video frequently.,4
12064,"Well structured, good explanations. Tests require java programming skills, could be a good idea to divide them into smaller pieces and combine them with other type of tests, so they can be distributed every other week instead of having 3 big programming exercises.",4
12066,"Course is good. Content wasn't updated after its initial run in 2014, so doesn't include recent developments. Could include a section on ethereum. Programming exercises could be structure better and unit tests could be exposed to students.",4
12068,"Great course. Very well explained topics. The only criticism would be on lack of tests in coding tasks, and only one language supported. (Java)",4
12079,"The course is just amazing, the assignments on the other hand are much less: hard, grader issues ...Thank you!",4
12083,Love this course! The lectures were outstanding. I took one star off for the programming assignments. There is much wasted time required. No test framework is given that allows developing code outside of the grader. And trying to debug code by submitting to the grader is difficult and time consuming.,4
12088,"Good course, but without Certificates!",4
12089,"The content and videos are good, but the programming assignments could really use some work to make them easier to understand and implement.",4
12096,good course,4
12103,I like the course for its clear structure and straightforward content.,4
12107,I am really fascinated by this course and its a first step towards Project Planning and specially Lean Scheduling Its a brilliant and advance method in Construction field.,4
12114,The course is very helful in understanding the various concept of scheduling. The course material gives to the poibt views and examples to understand tbe concept and very nicely delivered.,4
12116,"Very briefly covered and clearly explained, but in my opinion it needs to add more on Risk assessment and management, and baseline scheduling.",4
12124,"A good course with valuable insights, however, I'd like to see more assignments",4
12127,Good and brilliant one,4
12128,"Good tools and explanations, good audio. Thanks!",4
12135,"Overall very detailed and informative. A great way to get insight into English Common Law. I just felt that in the last week (6), perhaps the transcripts in English had a few mistakes and seemed to be missing out a few words of the lecturer. Also a few grammatical mistakes, which seemed slightly odd? Nevertheless. Very happy ultimately.",4
12138,Comprehensive introductory course that sets a good foundation for future study in English Law,4
12144,The testing element could be improved with in-video quizzes and the end of chapter test could be expanded to include more varied and generally more questions. The lecturer is clearly top-notch and an expert in his field. Very informative and thoroughly enjoyed it.,4
12156,"a wonderful introduction to the the law, and a fascinating new educational experience for me as a year 12 student that has provided me with knowledge and insights that are hard to find at this stage of my education. although at times i felt the lectures got slightly repetitive, this course has provided me with valuable skills that i will certainly draw upon in the future.",4
12157,Useful update for old students.,4
12160,"This is a superb introduction to the principles of common law and how it functions in the UK. I would have liked supplementary reading, whether mandatory for the course or merely suggested.",4
12164,The course needs pdf files for additional information.,4
12185,"I am an engineer with no background in law, but found it rather easy to follow Prof Gearey as he neatly unravelled the hidden logic of a complex, amorphous subject. The lectures build on the topic from first principles and the quizzes are well designed. I am hooked on the subject and am ready to tackle some of the more difficult subjects.",4
12186,A very informative course,4
12190,Interesting course on the English legal system. Just keep in mind that the audio is not that great in some areas. However I highly recommend this course.,4
12192,Informative and engaging.,4
12194,this course is help for the communication,4
12198,Quizzes are extremely subjective and hard to pass. Couldn't find direct relation between content and questions. Cultural barriers might be to blame.,4
12204,Simple and nice course,4
12208,Overall a good class but the required reading links could use some help as they didn't always seem to cover the videos of that section.,4
12215,Good course to learn communicating with various types of people in various environment.,4
12217,Simple and nice course ... to the point,4
12220,Course is very informative and practical,4
12221,"Always good to learn how to communicate in an efficient way, even with new technology",4
12225,I enjoyed this course. I used it for personal development. It gave great tools and information to think about as a middle manager and how to properly communicate with,4
12233,"Very helpful, I wish the ""slides"" had more in them so that I could use them for quick review.",4
12238,Useful course for middle and senior managers. Helps with different perspectives and practical tips to be more effective at this. Highly recommended. Thanks!,4
12247,"Great course, but really short. Could have more content! :)",4
12248,A very informative course. Thank you.,4
12250,"It is good course. Very brief and practical. As always, the most important things is to practice in real life situation.",4
12253,More interviews were few real-life scenarios are discussed will be useful. Patricia is one of the most expressive tutors on Coursera and her energy & enthusiasm is infectious.,4
12254,"Theoretical, lack of activities.",4
12255,"Good tools, approaches, and guidance on communication with different people within an organization. The only drawback of this course is that it relies a lot on additional readings rather than lectures slides.",4
12261,It was GOOD !!!,4
12267,"I think this course did a nice job of breaking things down into manageable pieces. The required readings were very helpful, but there was one link that was unclear what I was supposed to read on the link",4
12268,"Good course. It will help both managers as well as direct reports to find a common interface for better communication, and more efficient business relationships.",4
12271,This was a great course. I understood how important listening is in Communication.,4
12278,A great introduction to basic communication theory as it applies to the workplace.,4
12279,"Great lectures, the only problem is I could not find the entrance of forum. I want to discuss some topics with other learners.",4
12283,I enjoyed the structure of the modules and the recommended readings were very,4
12284,"Aside form the sound quality issues during certain sections, the quality of this course is excellent!",4
12287,"A lot of reading, but the course is pretty thorough. The quizzes are mostly just regurgitating information from the readings.",4
12289,Sound information. Would have liked more verbal communication regarding communication styles. Maybe some role playing scenarios.,4
12290,Interesting course,4
12300,"A nice Course explaining the very basics of cataract surgery. Almost all areas covered, but for some topics videos can be added along with the theory lecture. More links to youtube videos explaining your point of view would be welcome. Nice initiative but I hope they keep on adding slightly more detail to the Videos in future editions.",4
12305,THANK YOU!,4
12312,Very useful for me as an Engineer but a bit out of date,4
12314,"This is a very interesting and enjoyable course that gives great reading materials supplementary to the main materials. Thank you to the course team. The key problem with the course design is the peer marked review system for the final assignment. In the language of the course, there is no 'intrinsic motivation' to peers to mark correctly or with any effort, leading to inappropriate marking practices.",4
12321,"Extremely interesting course, which widen our outlook on the management",4
12345,Good lecture and content,4
12347,Peers review is not that positive as people are not that fair.,4
12352,"Excellent overview of Management Models to consider moving forward and how well they play out against the challenges managers faces today, its benefits and weaknesses and related points to be considered",4
12355,Good and clear.,4
12356,"Useful, pragmatic and realistic view of where to head for the future, as far as company mgt is concerned.",4
12365,Good course specially for senior level executives who get caught in the usual rut of EBITDA/Profitability and Stock Analysts,4
12373,Good course content with great examples,4
12376,The most useful parts were salary benchmarking and explanation of stock options. I think there could be more details on how these small parts expand into,4
12379,The content was very extensive but due to the fact that I'm still in secondary school some of the content was over my head and targeted towards people that have been in the field for a few years.,4
12382,a very good and comprehensive course. The videos are very informative and the presentations are also very good.Some details can be added into ESOP development and how to budget for employee compensation.,4
12383,"I loved this module. Thus, I want to thank the teacher and the Minnesota University for offering me the chance to keep learning on this matter!",4
12390,Pros: covers lots of good topics about Big DataCons: No real big data exercise,4
12414,course is very good. Excercises are very good. learnt alot about the mongodb and spark sql and RDD's,4
12423,Very well explained!! This course and specialization are really good!,4
12428,Content was good however we need to get more support on hands on as sometime we feel that we are stuck due to non availability of the right,4
12429,"Some of the lectures seemed slightly lesser quality with regards to the materials. For moocs especially, I would like to have the lecture better documented in order to download and review later.",4
12430,"I had a considerable difficulty with the last exercise because it seams to aim to a different level of students than the ones that followed the rest of the course. I would suggest to put the rest of the course, videos, exercises, etc. to the level of the fine_project which, in my opinion, is the correct level.",4
12449,"This is a very descent to understand MongoDB and Apache Spark. It contains hands on assignments will will allow you to learn how to handle these two software. The course is introductory level, and I recommend this course to people who have not used MongoDB and Apache Spark.",4
12454,"I felt this module, like most, represented good value for money. It's obviously not exhaustive, but you shouldn't expect it to be for the price.The final quiz was a nice challenge and struck a good balance between course material and requiring you to research information online.",4
12473,Well made and practical.,4
12481,I really liked the community and the peer review assignments that made me do some creative stuff that i enjoyed,4
12487,Over all the class was great and I learned new things and tried techniques I have always wanted to use but didn't know how. I really wish there was a way to see all the of the submissions for the peer review once we have handed our assignment in and have finished reviewing the minimum requirement. I think a lot can be learned by seeing how everyone else in the class interpreted the assignment. It would be fun to see what everyone else photographed.,4
12492,Nice course. Gives a good overview for beginners.It would have been better if you show different camera's and their control buttons.,4
12497,Thank you for allowing me to audit this course.,4
12503,Great course that explains a lot of core concepts and techniques (like controlling depth of field). Also gives a great introduction to the different types of lenses available. My only criticism would be that the last two weeks are lighter on content (however the assignments are challenging and a lot of fun!),4
12507,"Even though it's the second course in the specialization, it is still an introductory course, a great option to learn about the details of camera control and to improve or review basic techniques. This is also a challenging course, you will start to test your own boundaries.",4
12518,Awesome course! Will definitely tell other people about it,4
12521,Same comment as before. Do the professors ever look at the assignments? Can we get feedback from the people teaching the course?,4
12527,Interesting aspects on camera usage are well explained. Interesting assignments as well.,4
12528,Great content but some very choppy editing which spoils the flow. I'd much rather have longer lessons and less aggressive editing,4
12536,"Great introduction course to photo exposure techniques using ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. The course on depth of field was short and felt a bit rushed so I suggest using a supplemental text book or online resources during the section.",4
12539,I have learned more about photography in the short few weeks than I have studying by myself in much more time. Great course.,4
12542,Useful lessons to have the basic knowledge of photography.Clear and well taught.,4
12545,Great to be given such clear instruction.,4
12548,I am learning a lot about my camera!,4
12557,"Although some matters are presented quite broadly and generically, some others are exhaustive and of practical usage, especially the ones supported by documents and references: very useful!",4
12558,I found the lessons on cultural aspects were very interesting and well instructed.,4
12569,A little boring,4
12573,It's a good course for the basic study,4
12575,"I wanted to ask but it is not possible (there are not chat or discussión).I think this course is interesting but I need to learn more english first and I realy realy want to know it, How I can to know the profits (payoffs) by my company?",4
12577,simple charming,4
12591,"very good course to let you know how is the strategy, and how you set up the strategy",4
12596,intresting !!!!,4
12602,Nice course explaining basics of complex analysis.,4
12607,Interesting and illuminating course on Complex Analysis. Thank you so much.,4
12618,Good introduction to Complex Analysis,4
12633,Very good course. I learned a lot of new things,4
12635,The course is really interesting and it is very clear.thanks a lot of !Sylvain,4
12640,"I found this very interesting, covering some topics I did not expect an introduction. I think the pace of the course is about right, but I would have liked more questions. Unfortunately I became very busy during the course and failed to keep up. I look forward to repeating it when I have more time.",4
12654,Perfect overview on machine learning methods. The numerical example could be better. The Neural Network is also didn't cover that is very common now.,4
12663,not enough work in the other machine learning models (the course centered the main part of it to classification ),4
12664,"I think its a good introductory course, but lacking in exercises.",4
12665,"This is a valuable course in learning the basics of machine learning. but I was hoping to to get more hands on practice in this course. but overall, i learned a lot with the existing content.",4
12666,"well structured, fits well to beginners!",4
12667,"Good overview of tools specially Spark. The last demo handson with Spark clustering had too much content to be covered in 11 minutes. The presenter does not give any details on many functions he was using. Felt like copy paste coding. The rest was good, specially the lecturer compared to the lecturers of the other courses of the specialisation.",4
12670,Easy to follow. Good resource to understand the basic concept of big data.,4
12675,excellent! best place to begin with Big Data and ML!,4
12681,"This was a good introductory class to machine learning, but I wish it had more depth.",4
12683,"Have to make sure that code provided are fine and without problem... also, better instructions on how to go about the tool needed to use. Remember, we are learning and the amount of tools in Big Data ecosystem is vast...",4
12684,Good overview of working with SPARK and KNIME - acceptable little theoretical background for all the presented concepts for the sake of application use.,4
12687,insightful,4
12700,Thorough course on Metastasis that anyone can follow regardless of whether they have a background in medicine/science or not ; loses a star for locking access to the quizzes to non-paying coursetakers.,4
12704,Loved it! Thank you teachers! Wish it had bit more details though :),4
12711,"Course content was excellent, and very interesting. The presentation could be improved however; at times I found it hard to hear what was being said due to poor sound quality. Nevertheless the course has served as an excellent introduction to Chinese culture and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about it.",4
12727,"Great information, great teacher, greater visual presentation. Disclaimer: I only took the first week.",4
12728,Pioneering online course in Electron Microscopy.,4
12729,Great introduction to Cryo-EM for biologists that covers all the basics in a clear and concise manner.,4
12741,Just needs a certificate and some practice concept questsions added and would be perfect. Right now just really interesting videos for the intermediate mind...not much math...mostly concepts so good for the beginner who wants to know more. :),4
12746,"The lectures are very good and give a good overview of the subject of the whole computer architecture and its optimization. Unfortuntely only MIPS processor is focused and rest of architectures are not discussed. Furthermore, I think that it could be better if the quizzes were more tricky and that if there had been a comprehensive final exam at the end of the course.",4
12749,A well done course. Some on-line exercises are necessary.,4
12750,"Could use more content, breezed through in 3h on 2x speed achieving 93%.",4
12755,"It seems the ""summary"" videos are exactly the ""copy"" of previous ones. It will be better if the professor could add more new stuff.",4
12761,"The course is great. Although it is really fast and requires some advanced understanding of algebra and statistics, it is not bad. However, I would reccommend to expand it and to include the advances in non-manipulative causation, as sustained by proff. J. Pearl and F. Squazzoni (specifically talking about sociology).",4
12764,Great intro to causal effects. Gives great intuition.,4
12766,"Material is goodLecture style is dull, monotonous & uninspiringFor best results - follow the advice given in the MOOC, i.e read relevant readings before viewing lectures.",4
12771,"This course certainly gives a good idea of Data Analytics for a Six Sigma Project. However, for a beginner like me, I think one has to do extensive reading of different analytical technique such as 2 T test, ANOVA etc, as I found this course doesn't cover the theoretical aspects. Still, it is a nice course to start with and I am looking forward to further courses from the team.",4
12777,"The course is structured and easy to understand with a lot of practice exercises. However, I use Minitab on a MacBook and there are differences in the layout and location of functions. I struggled to find certain functions; even googling did not help. I would suggest you incorporate instructions for Mac users to use software tools. Overall, the course is very informative and definitely adds value.",4
12778,Good learning on data analysis & its method etc & how it can be used,4

12795,"I like this course , It is informative and useful for the people who wants to gain knowledge about Cyber Security. It gives a general understanding for this domain.",4
12796,The course is good but need to be more in depth videos and tutorial.,4
12799,"Great course, should have more videos, but a lot of reading and helpful stuff and links to learn.",4
12802,A good primer for the modern world.,4
12815,It was nice course and really helpful.,4
12816,Good course to get attention and find out what is going on within Cyber Security,4
12825,It was good and informative. But i did not feel challenge while taking the course. Good course for beginners.,4
12828,"Nice course, very informative.",4
12837,"A complete course if you follow the readings dutifully, good material, but the videos seem a little shallow and you wont learn much just sprinting through it, though you may pass.",4
12841,"Very interesting course, good starting point to get deeper into cyber security as a field!",4
12842,Addressing measure issues and concern with today's cyber world.,4
12848,The course gives a perfect introduction to the field of Cybersecurity,4
12856,great course,4
12857,A good course for persons those who are employed as in security role to an any organisation. I appreciate the method of distance learning to all on online. Thanks.,4
12858,this course is very important nowadays!,4
12871,"I really enjoyed this course, It's very informative",4
12873,Course is very interesting but i think the videos are very short. Better to make longer videos,4
12874,I love this!,4
12877,"Very good course. However, you need to do a lot of reading. The videos are simply introductions to the topics. The course has a lot of reading. The readings are great resources, however, some of them are very very long. I wish the videos had more of a lecture component. The final was difficult as you had no idea what would and what would not be on it. Great information, in-depth course, but it could have more video/lecture resources. It could also have more information concerning the information on the final exam.",4
12879,More like a good guide then an explaining lesson.,4
12881,"I enjoyed the course, found that the videos didn't really help and guide that much.",4
12888,awesome course,4
12890,"what a course, elaborative and to the point",4
12898,Very interesting and also made me more knowledgeable on the general subject of IT security.,4
12903,"Gets you to know the basics of Cyber Security. This definitely is a foundation course and has good topics. If you are looking out for information on Cyber Security and do not have a clue about where to start from, this course is recommended for you.",4
12905,Great to learn more knowledge.,4
12909,Very good course. Some readings and the final test are not so easy for people with other mothertongue than english but it is possible.,4
12919,Very good beginner level course,4
12924,Interesting course ... final quiz is a little bit going deep into details,4
12925,great stuff learnt !!,4
12926,"The best part about this course was that it made sure you are interested in learning the subject. If not, it is really really difficult to get on with it. It makes sure you understand the subject really well and you have to give back to the community.I liked the fact that you have to read the ""Readings for this module"" part, otherwise you won't be able to pass the Quizzes at the end of each module. You have to write a short paragraph which it will be reviewed by peers, who will in turn give you ratings. You have to do the same for other peers. This was probably the best aspect of this course.The music was extremely annoying and the quality of the content in the videos was okay, but the most important part is that it guided me in the right direction every time. Sometimes, by the end of the video, the music started in between the lecture itself and played itself for 3-4 seconds.",4
12929,More reading on my own than I expected but great class overall.,4
12932,Very Informative even if you work in the industry the last part week 6 is definitely a learning experiencethe videos are short but the reading material is great,4
12935,"Need more information in videos, but course is very nice - especially I liked submissions",4
12936,Good but not so deep as I expected.,4
12937,Loving it so far,4
12945,Interesting! It´s a good choice!,4
12947,Very useful course for beginners in cyber security,4
12949,Not to much information during videolection as i expected.,4
12952,The video's could be more informative and longer,4
12953,This is quite a good course. However it's pretty basic and if you are trying to dig deep into Cybersecurity I suggest taking the Cybersecurity specialization.,4
12959,The lectures are brief and a lot of readings on the reference materials are needed.,4
12973,Its very excellent teaching method. short time more information.,4
12975,"The lectures were too heavy on Industry experts who quickly covered the important topics. I have taken many technology and business courses on Coursera with one or two professors covering the important content accented with industry and subject matter expert interviews. This format works best for consistency and learning, IMHO.. A student who is not in the Cybersecurity field will not gain insight into the meat of the material from the lectures. The final exam question material is almost exclusively absent in the lectures. One is required to read the cited material to gain the required information",4
12977,"Good information, would have preferred more in-depth lectures and detailed information. More lecturer interaction/engagement on the issues.Overall I enjoyed the course and it was great.",4
12978,"Like any course, you get as much out as you put in. The real learning comes from reviewing the reading material-- even as an IT professional, I was able to learn quite a bit. IMO, this material should be readily available as a high school elective.",4
12979,"This was a good introduction to the field of Cybersecurity, but I wished for a more in depth coverage of many of the topics and other topics. This class would not be a preparation for the Security+ exam, for example, but it is a good start as an overview of Cybersecurity.",4
12987,Thanks,4
12989,Good course,4
12992,Good amount of knowledge,4
13012,"MUY BUENA TEMATICA QUE SE MANEJA EN EL CURSO, LO UNICO QUE SUGIERO ES QUE IMPLEMENTARAN TAREAS PRACTICAS EN CUANTO A LOS REGISTROS CONTABLES.",4
13025,introduction to many useful online data resources,4
13035,"Great and quick way to learn things. Thanks for the troubles taken to put this together. Some of the computational exercises could do with a little more clarity of language. But, overall, Great!",4
13069,"This course was great. The instructor really broke down the fundamentals of Data Analytics in several of modules. The only thing I would have liked a little more explanation on is the SQL section in module 3. I felt like this module went a little fast and could use some more supplemental information. Overall, this was a great intro into the world of data analytics.",4
13075,Very very good. Needs some clean up in the PowerPoints and perhaps a bit more elaboration with some concepts. The quizzes were a bit tricky where some of the questions hinged on a single word or phrase in the lecture.,4
13076,"Overall, course quality is good and have a appropriate level of knowledge for new analysts. I will recommend for who begins learning about data analytic.Need improve:Some of the subtitles are wrong.Examinations need have more explanations, they will be helpful when we choose the wrong answer.I need to wait too long for reviewing someone in the end of course. Please consider this.",4
13078,Great overview of the world of data analysis.,4
13081,This was a really good overview/introduction to a lot of the concepts needed for Analytics roles in business!,4
13083,Great set of materials. Great introduction on data analytics,4
13097,"Very well structured, overall good (sometimes slow) pacing. In this introductory, only very simplified settings with few variables are considered. The course description could highlight that.Although they are not long each, I personally found the style of the videos a little tiresome (talking head scribbling illegibly on powerpoint slides). I therefore just listened to them as 'audio' while doing errands around the house, and only returned to my desk for the invideo tests. Worked well.",4
13099,Very good course with a professional instructors and hoping to enrich it with many other examples for different rules,4
13100,Eye opening now i know better how to plan operations for Q2.,4
13116,"This is a very good course, however it is not in my main line of interest and I kind of lost interest.",4
13124,One of the best treatments of a complex subject. I loved taking the course.,4
13126,Got very good insights on the application of the various aspects of Game Theory in the real world scenario.,4
13128,Very good course with basic but extremely important concepts.,4
13132,Well structured course and considerable amount of materials covered. Thank you,4
13134,Nice course for a preliminary understanding of Game Theory! Highly recommended!!!,4
13143,"This is amazing course, easy and informative.Thank you.",4
13148,I really enjoyed this course. Topics are well explained and there are a lot of real world examples. The only negative aspect is that there is no certificate for this course.,4
13150,Interesting and informative course!,4
13155,"The course was a great experience for a coursera beginner like me. The reader explained the issues with good examples and used descriptive use cases. The only problem I had was that some of the exams are broke down my browser, but I think that this was a problem between coursera and IE11.",4
13160,Excellent perspective of competitive strategy in general. The lecturer was very articulate and gave insightful anecdotes to all the concepts being taught. Very good for developing business thinking on the fly with all the different considerations. Suggestion would be to create a end of course case project.,4
13162,Very nice course.,4
13173,Very much enjoyed the course; the instructor used good examples and the content was relevant and aligned well with the subject matter. Enough examples and quizzes to reinforce the theories. I'm looking forward to follow-up with the 2nd course.,4
13188,Very interesting and developed very smartly. Thank you.,4
13189,"Well-structured and entertaining course, in which basic competitive concepts are issued. I dont rank it with 5 stars because I think they should post the slides of the lessons for the students and they have to add the possibility of paying for a certificate",4
13191,Very structured which allows a step-by-step,4
13194,Its very good for understanding purposethank you so much,4
13203,Great course! Very comlex and engaging!,4
13208,Very Clear and insightful.,4
13211,"I guess the professor is not a native English speaker,(neither am I,) So I find some sentences in the PPT quite confusing. Everything else is perfect.",4
13213,"Enjoyed this course. There was a bit of confusion on some points, but overall really good.",4
13214,"Very good compare to what the courses in Nicaragua are like. Perhaps the bad point are the examples that the professor use, many of then are not so realistics. When learning about a situation that conditionate our strategy, we must also know what others inputs take part too.",4
13216,It has helped me to view business in a new way,4
13226,"Hi, I took this course as a refresher and found it very helpful.It is well structured and easy to follow, clearly communicated through a rich set of exmaples. I recommend it for those with an interest in the subject matter.For myself I look forward to starting the Advanced module.",4
13233,That is good!,4
13236,"lectures are very well explained by the professor and slowly the complexity of the subject is exposed. The content was presented in a clear and sometimes funny/remarkable way. I learned quite a lot, so my thanks!",4
13237,Great course! I learned to combine traditional strategic concepts with game theory. I would liked some bibliographic references.,4
13242,"I would like to receive a certificate, that's why I don't rate it with 5 stars.",4
13243,I loved this class it was very easy to follow along.,4
13246,Its a great course filled with information and practical examples. Doing Advanced Competitive Strategy now.,4
13248,Good analytical concepts into strategy with competitors. Recommended for anyone who is in business and or intends to start a business in a competitive environment.,4
13255,I really enjoyed this course. The fact that I can go at my own pace helped me a lot to be able to finish it.,4
13263,"I have mixed feelings about this course. From a instructor and content perspective, this is by far the best. Tobias is a great teacher and he explains the concepts very nicely followed up by quizzes.What I hated about this course was the web exprience and how the final questions were set up. It gave a feeling that the intent was to ""get you"" vusrses questions that were more to see if a student has understood the concepts. Some of the multiple choice answers were borderline and a rational mind could go either way. So my suggestion is to significantly rewamp your quizzes.From a technical perspective, the system did not capture my results the first time, It graded me differently on the same set of questions (this needs to be really looked into) for example the first time I answered the question a certain way, it marked me correct, however the same answer in the next attemp was marked wrong??? This lead to a lot of confusion (and I am not saying because the numbers in the answers were changed on different attemps but the content itself was marked differently).I loved this course and would have loved to attempt the advanced strategy course however but for the above reasons will not.Its dissapointing that although the instructure and content is world class the technical glitches are too many for a student to have a seamless, learning experience. Hope this helps and topics mentioned aboove would be seriously looked into. I want this course to be a success as this the one of the most insightful courses that I have taken.",4
13269,It is an excellent course. My only feedback is to make it even more interactive that makes the students engage and learn. Also provide more real-life and challenging examples.,4
13275,hiI am studying management and the new approach appears to me to see you.tank you :-),4
13283,"Very good course, interesting and helpful.",4
13286,"Very complete and well explained, goes slowly sometimes!",4
13289,"Enjoyed the class, Game Theory has always been interesting to me.",4
13292,I really enjoyed this course! Learned lots of valuable concept for my business in an easy way. I suggest this course to every entrepreneur out there!,4
13293,A good intersection of Micro-economics and Game Theory. Very well structured.,4
13294,Even though the course talks about strategy a better tittle could be Game Strategy applied to Competitive Strategy.,4
13300,"I liked the course, it opened my eyes to new ways of thinking, and I'm continuing the advanced competitive strategy course. The approach of making models and calculations to see what the best strategy for a given company is, can help greatly with making sense of a chaotic world.Minor points to better the course: The lectures are sometimes too simple, especially the examples given can be sped up, up the ante ;)!. In the quiz one whole answer is false if one of the sub-answers is false, especially with 10 answers to give, I sometimes had a hard time to pass a question due to this reason, can this be resolved a bit? Say for example, a question is passed if 80% of the sub-answers are correct?Overall... thanks dear Tobias for having me in your class!Greetz Floor",4
13305,Good course,4
13313,Excellent course. Very Helpful in understanding competitor analysis.,4
13315,"Very insightful, although very theoretical. It is great to create awareness of different strategical concepts and how they are applied, but not enough details in how it would actually play out in a real scenario between different entities. Kept me wanting to learn more though, which is a very good thing ;).",4
13319,Very useful.,4
13320,This is a brilliant introductory course on Competitive Strategy. Instructor explains the concepts well. It would be useful to get the slides of the lectures.,4
13321,"A very informative course, looks at the application of game theory to the world of business. Clear explanations and good tests.I would like to know why he has an AT-AT next to him in lectures however.",4
13324,Fantastic course except for the quiz questions. Many of them can be interpreted in a way that an answer different from the intended one can work too.,4
13326,Awesome learning experience. The interactive way of teaching by respective professor Tobias Kretschmer has created great curiosity. The examples discussed are highly relevant and laymen for freshers. Definitely going for next advanced course. Enjoyed the learning Game Theory.,4
13336,Slides availability could prove helpful,4
13345,"The professor was good. There was an over abundance of game theory, however.",4
13346,"Really interesting subject, with helpful quizzes. Some technical issues with the videos but nothing there to stop you from gaining some really helpful skills, if you dig business related courses.",4
13348,"very well structured course, good to have no limitations on start or end dates. I enjoyed it and learned a lot.",4
13351,Good course especially for those involved in business strategy. It requires attention and a lot of quizzes to be solved. Nonetheless all information shared by the professor can be useful and a knowledge advantage. This course can be taken by people who aren't familiar with business/finance/economics.,4
13355,Easily set up hence easy to follow! no room for boreness!,4
13363,"Very interesting, lots of useful structure",4
13364,"Nice course and good classmates. It's very focus oriented and gives very good idea of Shiny, Rmarkdown, plotly and how to publish documents on github, Rpubs and other online sites. I learnt power of R",4
13366,"Nice course. Developping a web app in R is not exactly mainstream, but I learned a lot.",4
13368,"I think this one is the best from the Specialization as it is the most Practical one (more than Practical Machine Learning).Can be taken without the others if you have basic experience in R and want to learn about cool R applications.The reason I don't give full rating is for not having practical assignment every week. So there wasn't enough effort put into the course. Of course, we can do optional homework and make more applications, but assignments like these should be mandatory. There is no package building and no swirl course building - So why do we have week 3 and 4 at all? The quizzes are also laughable - no knowledge testing at all.So although I liked this course from the Specialization the most, I still can't give full rating because of the mentioned issues.",4
13379,Excellent course. Got to learn Shiny Application in this.,4
13381,"I really like the new version of this. It mixes a lot of tools, but most are useful. It was fun doing the assignments.",4
13384,"Really Interesting class, interactive app/plot is so much fun. Great to be able to make creative stuff myself.",4
13392,Awesome course. Overview of all the things you need to become part of the data science community in terms of contributing and sharing.,4
13393,"Great introduction to interactive plotting, mapping, and shiny. Deeper examples would be helpful.",4
13398,great course,4
13401,"Great course, just like the others in the certification.",4
13404,"This is an excellent course that will teach you plethora of new things! The only gotcha is that things move too fast in the world of Data Science. Some of the topics and code might not work exactly as shown when you take the course, and many things will change. It's up to the student to make-up for the missing pieces, but I guess that is the only caveat when you work in a still-evolving field.",4
13405,Great Course,4
13410,Good course but I think it can be better.,4
13411,Love it!,4
13414,"The skills taught in this course are fantastic and I'm sure using them will blow my colleagues' minds away. However, I must say that the lectures on Rcharts and other interactive plot builders sound kinda sloppy, poorly prepared. I know the documentation for those packages is bad and it takes effort to figure out what they do, but that is precisely why a well-prepared lecture would be so useful. I would also talk about license, since we have been dealing with packages that are completely open for use, but these have some restrictions.",4
13415,"I enjoyed the class, but was frustrated when it came time to get my Slidify to work on GitHub (since RPubs wasn't publishing them correctly.) I had to convert it to RPres (which was easy, thankfully) in order to get my project submitted in time.",4
13421,A very straightforward course on how to build fast and useful applications fora broader audience.,4
13430,The lecture is not so fluent taught than other coursers in the specialization,4
13431,"Compared to the other classes in the JHU Data Science specialization, this one is pretty laid back. It's useful information, and teaches a few nice tricks on how to present data analysis results.",4
13443,Good and useful module.,4
13445,"Good overview of available tools. Lack of practice exercises makes preparing for quizzes difficult. However, the course project does a good job to get your feet wet with Shiny Apps.",4
13449,"I liked the course and found it informative, but wish there were more stuff on Shiny Widgets and Input/Output/Render topic. R Shiny tutorial is pretty good, but I was hoping more relevant info about those topics from this course.",4
13464,"Although all coursera courses are same, the peer assessment is very useful for this course. It's very helpful to see products made by other people.",4
13465,Interesting course showing some of the possibilities for visualising and publishing data.,4
13467,Covered really useful tools like shiny and slidify.,4
13478,Interesting course,4
13482,"In general, an excellent course, taught by competent professors. I believe that in the main this course does very well in achieving its objective of knowledge transfer. However, having experienced it, there were parts where the professor was demonstrating a topic using a video presentation showing him operate a process or screen sequence on his computer. These aspects, like virtually all the material on this course, are of a technical nature and contain many important details. As such, to help complete and re-enforce their learning, students require something like a sequence of slides that they can print out and retain for revision and future reference. In certain parts, the provision of the printable screenshots in the form of slides was absent.An important theme of the course and Data Science in general is ""Reproducible Research"". What I'm arguing for here is, ""Reproducible Learning Materials"" covering a complete course, not only parts of it. Admittedly, it was only a very small proportion of the course that suffers from this defect. But I would not like it to become the norm in the future. As a suggestion, it could be possible to author a lecture using HTML so as to combine the verbatum lecture text with every slide/screenshot image embedded in its right position within the lecture.I notice Coursera courses have also moved away from the weekly lists of individual lectures together with their links to .txt, .mp4, etc. files. The new presentation keeps you submerged within the flow within each week's series of lectures. One has to 'click out' in order to watch your progress and then re-enter the lectures at a resumption point. I prefer the previous navigation structure in order to access lectures and materials. Printed learning materials are also important for me, in addition to the video lectures. The latter are of course vital as the medium for the initial exposure of the material.",4
13483,"Taken this course in its old fashion style. Now reviewing the new design was a little bit displacing, but I ascribe this to the fact I've done all the specialization courses in the old design.However the structure of the course is quite good. Some typos were reported, as well as a bug on the unanswered questions in quiz 3. Main worst point was the missing format of several text boxes. I would have appreciated paragraphs, bold and italic, some links, picture, not only raw plain text.Overall review is nonetheless over the average.",4
13485,This course gives a good introduction on how to develop an application.It gives all the available tools in the field out for us to try and use them.The course is enjoyable and not stressful. I find the assignment as meant to get us to do the project and not really there to fail us. It is difficult to fail to course as only the minimum is required.,4
13501,"Another good course, though the last two weeks were a lot harder to follow than the prior ones. Not because the material was that much harder, but the lectures and homeworks were less clear (a lot of descriptions of how to do various operations without explaining why).",4
13509,"This course is very hard for non-STEM major student, even non CS-major student. Some concepts are very abstract to explain. The course team generally did a good job at explaining concept, but it would be better if they can offer more examples, animations, illustrations, sample code and explanations, etc. to help students understand these concepts. A rewarding course overall. Best if you are going to have a code interview.",4
13511,The quality of the course is very high. However I give a slightly lower rating than for the Class 1 from the specialization. The assignments seemed little unbalanced this time - some were very easy while other were very hard (I passed one after loading a special package to manipulate data or recursion limit).,4
13512,I've learnt a lot. The content is very interesting but a bit challenging. I had hard times accomplishing all the assignment and put much more work than I expected.,4
13520,Very good course. I would not say its for beginner. But would definitely helps you in the future progress of your career.,4
13521,"First weeks are awesome, it is a great course if you want understand very well some structures like heaps or union/find. I just think the last week is too fast and concise, I would like some additional work about trees and for many users could be a problem, otherwise will be a 5 stars without any doubt, though for me this course worked very well.",4
13530,"First 3 weeks were great (as in first course of specialization), but material in last two weeks was very hard to understand. Feels some mess in explanations compared to other part of the course. Maybe its because of difficulty of the last weeks topics.",4
13531,"The final module with the Splay tree is way too difficult when compared to the rest of the material in the course. This course would be better structured with three assignments as follows: 1) tree order problem, 2) a simpler tree assignment that only deals with a basic binary search tree, 3) the set range sum problem implementing the splay tree, as an advanced problem. Aside from the difficulty of the last module, this is a great course. It's very comprehensive and you'll take away lots of useful information on course completion.",4
13534,"A really great course, you should definitely take this second after Algorithmic Toolbox, as that has an easier learning curve for the very 'CS professor' style code (lots of single letter variables and other quirks) and how projects should be submitted and tested.That said, there is a lot of good learning in this course. Make sure you have some good Algorithms textbooks to accompany the lectures, they have recommendations in the course. I personally use Sedgewick's book and CLRS which aren't exactly what they suggest, but work well. Take your time with the learning, make sure you really understand the concepts before moving on to the homework. Use multiple sources to learn (they provide plenty of links!) and you'll do well.In response to a very politely asked request for clarity: I rated this 4/5 rather than 5/5 stars as I found that for my preferred language (Python) some of the starter files were very poorly created. This meant I often have to rewrite the initial parsing of the inputs because it would create variables that contained incorrect or incomplete input data. Further, there were some non-harmful quirks like semi-colons or parameters shadowing Python reserved words in the code. The next course in this series, Algorithms on Graphs, did not seem to have any of these issues, though!",4
13536,Overall the course is good. The last two weeks on AVL andSplay trees need more examples and felt a bit rushed.,4
13539,The course material was good and the understanding of the subject was satisfactory . :)Thank You and keep us updated .,4
13543,"Excellent course in general, and I learned a lot of new data structures that one doesn't generally learn about in standard algorithms and data structures courses, like disjoint sets and splay trees.Only complaint is that sometimes the problems are too complicated for how easy they are. By this I mean that the problem statement is very long and elaborate, when what they are really asking is something trivial that can be programmed in a few lines, but it takes a while to understand just what they are asking.",4
13544,The last two weeks felt rushed. The Binary Search Tree/AVL Tree module doesn't have a quiz or an assignment and it's easy to move on without fully understanding both data structures. This allows for wasting time on the last assignment which relies on understanding AVL trees. I recommend reading the external resources for each lesson and making sure you have a grasp of the data structure before moving to the next module.,4
13550,The optional videos are not allotted enough time. Those concepts are difficult to grasp.,4
13555,"The last two weeks' content may need to be revised to provide a better learning experience. To me, it seems a little bit too fast.",4
13558,"great course but I think the last two modules are a little difficult to understand, especially for beginner like me",4
13560,the last lecture was too fast. Would be good to divide this into two parts. Rest all is great stuff.,4
13561,"Data Structures was really interesting, over all, also assignments are quite challenging. It's important to check the external references & discussion forums if you want to get the best of it.",4
13574,Awesome Experience completing this course,4
13575,the teachers are good and the visualization of lectures are very nice.,4
13584,Great course although last lesson about splay trees explanation is too fast and basic for me to understand.,4
13585,very theoritical,4
13591,"Good course, but the problem set is too small. They will be much better if they are more.",4
13597,"The fact that test cases are not available is extremely frustrating and time consuming. I absolutely disagree with the instructors about the reason why test cases are hidden.Michael LevinHi,Learning new complex things is time consuming, it is essential, and it is ok. Without this time spent you wouldn't have learned even half of what you've learned while trying to find your mistakes yourself. Also, the testing techniques presented here are indispensable in the real life, and many learners of the Algorithmic Toolbox course have already confirmed thisHello Mr. Levin,First please forgive me for communicating with you in this place. I am not sure if there is a direct way to answer you, but I believe you will have access to my response.I entirely agree with what you said that this needs time and I do not mind spending time learning new things. That is why I am here in the first place. But I think that hiding the test sets misplaces the balance where this time is being spend.Let me give you an example: week 3 – hash chains - assignment no. 2. I wrote the app, submitted this and it failed on test no. 5. Having generated tons of test cases I was nowhere closer as all looked good, but still failed your engine. As it turned out the problem was not with the algorithm implemented but with the presentation layer. ‘Check x’ command when x is not found in the hash table should return blank line and my program returned nothing. I could not find this in the specification hence lots of hours trying to figure out the solution.It was not a bug with the program, it was the problem how the data is presented. I do not mind spending time developing solutions to the assignments. I would love if there were more advanced (even optional) problems to solve but I want to spend this time on the algorithm and solving the task rather than trying to figure out how to display the data.Please, do not get me wrong, I absolutely adore the course, lectures are brilliant and my opinion should be regarded as a constructive criticism even if you do not agree with me. Thank you again for what you are doing.Regards,Marcin",4
13624,Useful and tangible knowledge delivered succinctly. Writing prompts a bit rigid and specific.,4
13626,Easy to follow and exercises were helpful to better understand the classes and to motivate towards more interesting writting. Thanks!,4
13627,"As a beginning and inspiring writer, this course is a fundamental stepping stone.",4
13628,Very good introduction class and i really learned a thing or two: particularly about the ABDCE structure and the guidance around always starting a scene with an action.,4
13629,"I'd rate any course as 4+, at the end of which I can learn something tangible. This course introduced me to basic structure of story telling. The assignment was fun and the explanation was simple enough.The best part was that the author explained concepts using Harry Potter and not some arcane book that I might not have read.",4
13635,"The course itself has been really useful, although I'm not sure it has taught me much that is truly new. What It has done, though, is to fill in gaps, and to give me a big helping hand into understanding how to tackle what to write about. Beforehand, I suffered somewhat from blank canvas syndrome, but this course has given me ideas to get past that. The Coursera site and app could still do with some work, since collaboration with other students is not as easy as it could",4
13641,"The exercises are good, and the material is clear. I really like that the students have to review each other's work. I found the feedback helpful, and I found reading other people's work helpful too. I really would like a teacher to grade me as well though. There were a couple of times that I wasn't certain that I fully understood what I was doing, so to have me grade someone else left me feeling unguided and unqualified to assign a grade. I believe I got feedback saying just that at least once.",4
13642,"The device of giving feedback has to simplistic, given the scope of the audience, but it's difficult to get any real value from it as far as future revisions. There should be a free write section that's required for someone to respond to the story organically as well as the specific, ""Did the writer do this?""",4
13644,I really enjoyed the taped lectures and thought the assignments paired nicely. I'd like if Coursera set up a interactive element to the online learning environment such as a live chat with the instructor once a week and perhaps a live forum area with a set meeting time for the students. I've taken other online classes that have had these and found them extremely useful.,4
13647,"A very good course on Plot by Brandon Skyhorse. Would have loved to go in more details into scene construction and structure. That is why gave it 4 stars, else it was a clear cut 5 star",4
13652,"I liked the way Mr. Skyhorse explains the secrets to construct a great plot. It was excellent in every sense of the word. However, my only complain of this course it's that you can't report those ""funny"" peers that write ""reviews"" like this one:"" ' ""It's so unfair that some of us, the real students, took our time to write detailed reviews about every peer assignment AND expected at least WORDS as reviews. You need to implement some kind of report system to ban those ""funny"" peers that only check your work to put the point and to get their course done. And to start that ""system"" I will tell you that:SHOKRY MOHAMED FATHALLAH EL SAYARThat guy, gave me reviews as I described before. Not only in this course, but in The Craft of Character. So PLEASE, someone needs to make justice and punish this guy. I can even send you captions of his ""reviews.""",4
13655,"Very interesting and enjoyable. Perhaps a little shorter than I expected, although I only audited the course.",4
13656,Good course. Got chance to read some interesting stories while reviewing peers. Discovered what I was doing wrong while writing stories.,4
13660,"I enjoyed this course. Brando's videos were great, I took lots of notes and used them to help complete the assignments. Over the years I've picked up books on the craft of writing but I find the motivation of deadlines to be a big help in actually creating a writing practice. The videos are short- the time commitment is really not bad. Reader feedback can be more or less involved, I did find a pretty good mix. It'd be nice if you could keep pace with the same group of students but people are entering at different times within a range so you can't keep up with individuals unless you want to spend a lot of time tracking them down.",4
13663,I enjoyed the course which was well presented and I feel I have learnt much from it.,4
13669,I think Skyhorse was very good. His instructions are clear. A little too heavy on Harry Potter references.The theory on the 5 act helped frame the work. This class inspired me to take all 5 courses.I wish is passion for writing would come thru a little stronger. It would also be nice to have more instructor feedback vs peer reviews.,4
13678,"Love the clear direct explanations. Would have enjoyed more examples, more robust practice examples and a longer class overall, to l earn more plotting, but love the prof. Brandon knows how to teach!!",4
13680,"This course is great for everyone interested in working on their writing skills, whether you're a beginner or more experienced. As a novice writer I learned about several useful tools that will help me improve my writing, got a lot more practice, and having a schedule helped me improve my daily routine for writing. For me the most valuable part was getting feedback and learning through analysing other people’s work. Oh, and just because the description says 1-2 hours of work per week doesn't mean you can't do a lot more!",4
13681,An excellent class. It helped me sharpen up my writing. I would say this is better than any book I ever read on writing. A huge part of it was in the reading and reviewing of other student's work. I felt I learned even more in doing that.,4
13689,"Simple, great start, could have been a little more profound though. Great start, no doubt.",4
13693,"I loved doing the course, and especially while doing each assignment of writing a story. The short guiding videos were to the point and interviews with personalities was engaging, Thanks for the course!!",4
13696,"This ""Craft of Plot"" class--taught by Mr. Skyhorse--covers the ABDCE method, the 21 point checklist, etc. Stories written in this class must have dialogue, at least ten points of rising action, and must begin with an action sequence. No, this is not an ""organic"" story writing method. This class teaches students how to use formulaic writing to artificially engineer stories efficiently and effectively. I was very disappointed with this class. I enjoy reading literary fiction, especially stories in The New Yorker. So it is no surprise that I was appalled by Mr. Skyhorse's strong focus on, and praise of, the Harry Potter book series. If you plan on writing formulaic genre fiction, then perhaps this class is for you. Even though I disliked the class, I must admit it was well taught, hence the 4/5 star review.",4
13698,"It makes you write a lot and that's the most important thing. However, there are some small inconsistencies in the materials, so additional reading might be recommended.",4
13702,"The course work is easy to follow, full of great information and very clear. The only thing I find inconsistent is the reviewing of others work. It seems no-one ever gets reviewed by the same person twice, which means the standard of reviews is varied and inconsistent. Also, many people may not be/feel qualified enough to review or feel bad about failing someone so wont. There can be a great deal learned by having mentors or qualified teachers review the work. Given that, I have learned a great deal in this course and understand, and think it's one of the best online courses I've seen. I also understand you get out what you put in. Thanks for the opportunity.",4
13704,"I enjoyed this course. Brando did a good job in breaking down the important aspects of plot and providing examples. I liked that lessons were concise. Each one contained roughly three videos, most less than 10 minutes. I thought this was very beginner friendly. I found Feyman's pyramid and Alice Adam's ABDCE of plot structure particularly useful and I especially enjoyed the Shop Talk videos where fellow writers discussed their approach to writing. I only audited this course, but it bugged me that my board kept displaying overdue assignments when that feature was locked.",4
13719,"I learned a lot about doing it the better way, than I did. What would have been cool: The essential graphics from the videos and some school material to print out and work with it.THX!",4
13748,The instructor has done a good job with the structure and assignments for this course. He explains the course and the assignments very well. I enjoyed the course.,4
13750,"A good introductory course to the craft of plot. Covers the basics, though I would appreciate some more complex assignments. Perhaps offer some more advanced course in the future? Maybe an advanced fiction specialization? Either way, good introductory course.",4
13751,"I learnt invaluable things in this course. I never knew of the Freytag's pyramid or the 21 point act structure etc and little by little, after doing the exercises, I feel I have learnt to edit my manuscript well enough. That has been my achievement as a learner of this course. Thanks a lot for the course. :)",4
13752,"The content is interesting, but not rich enough for a course. I finished all the videos and assignments in only 2 days.",4
13754,"Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing. However, I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums. People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections, should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material,without being graded. That was a sour point to the overall positive structure of the course.",4
13757,Full of helpful tips and suggestions.,4
13760,Clear and concise. Instructional. The only thing that I hope is to get more examples from the course except explanations.,4
13764,"A good introductory course designed to be effective for people of a basic background and beginning skill level. As a course from Wesleyan I was hoping for something a little more robust or actually at a college-level, so I was a little disappointed at how rudimentary this course was. Still, I did learn some new things about plot and would recommend for the new or beginning writer.",4
13768,"Brando did a great job in presenting a structure for plot. I think his insights are valuable and he did tried to offer practical guidelines writers can use.What I didn't like was the reviewing of the assignments. Some times I didn't receive valuable feedback ( the same sentence copy/pasted in every section) and someone failed me for not understanding my intentions because he was not an English speaker.Away from that, I really liked Brando, his style, and his involvement.",4
13772,"Good exercises. Good, interesting, helpful teacher. short lessons. concrete instructions",4
13775,"highly inspirational, clear, to the point. just sorry that assignments are only for fully registered course followers",4
13781,"Pretty good class; good information. The classmates are engaged and have good feedback to give.I'm frustrated at the lack of instructor (or even staff presence) until at least week 3, when finally a staff member answered *one* of the many student questions that have been piling up.Students are a great resource for critiquing work, but we can't help each other with technical questions, or with assignment clarifications. So there *definitely* needs to be staff on hand for that.",4
13782,"Good class, good lectures. The plot devices taught are very specific, but helpful for beginning writers for whom conflict, and movement are not easy. I'm a beginning writer and I struggle with finishing a story because at some point I just think, well now what? what's supposed to happen?The class helps you push the characters into conflict, and make choices, which is the heart of a good story.My only complaint - the assignments were so structured that they were tedious. the peer reviews in this class were also painful. Reading other people's work, I felt like perhaps we needed less structure and more space to practice simpler techniques.But overall, i'm using what I've learned in my writing, and its definitely helped!",4
13785,"Lots of great information. Most helpful for me was the story structure. My whole life I've been taught the same structure, either the 3-Act Hollywood Standard as told by Blake Snyder and Vikki King, or Chris Vogler's The Mythic Structure. It was nice to have a new approach. My only disappointment is that many genres, although follow a similar story structure, each genre has genre-specific elements. I was hoping that I'd learn the particularities of horror, mystery, comedy, and others. There doesn't seem to be much genre-specific information available online, except fantasy and erotica.",4
13789,"It's a good course. The explanations of plot and scene have made me understand for the first time what writing fiction is all about, and for the first time I was bale to write fiction that is better than anything I had ever written before.",4
13791,Thank you for giving me some concrete guidelines. I enjoyed following along without doing the assignments. Grateful to be able to be a part of the learning.,4
13792,"The course modules are helpful and easy to follow. I wish to give it 5 stars but because we, students, failed to experience the professor's feedback even in some of our thread, I think 4 stars are enough.",4
13801,"The video lectures are very nicely done. They outline the basics of how a story line (Plot!) should be, how the characters should be developed and how scenes should be depicted.The tips given are practical and clearly defined - even for noobsThe course motivated me to write, to refine my thoughts while writing and since there was always pressure of peers reviewing my work - I always revised what I wrote. I discovered that revision helps immensely, and I found I could express the same things in better ways and using lesser wordsSome students did have difficulties in understanding assignments - something that can get better with time. Also, I felt some learners received the brunt of bad grading since the grading guidelines weren't clear. Shaving off 1 star due to that",4
13809,"While this course was interesting, it seemed very light. There was only about 10 or so minutes of 'content' a week, plus some interviews (which were very interesting, but didn't feel as though they taught too much). The assignments were all good except for the third one about the physical object. It was a weird prompt and not in a good way.I would recommend this course, but I'd also love to see it expanded a bit.",4
13813,The content of the course is very useful and delivered in a structured and effective way. I enjoyed the writing assignments and feedback opportunities. My only complaint is that there are a great number of people auditing the course and we had to create our own google community to share and get feedback as the assignments and feedback sections of the course are locked for all of the non-paying students.Other than that is was very enjoyable and informative.,4
13814,"Short, pithy descriptions; to the point advice/ suggestions with leeway to alter the structure. Worth the time.",4
13820,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I would highly recommend it to new writers, old authors, editors, and anyone interested in stories. It was a great recap and refreshed the basics.",4
13825,"This is a very good course, but I would have expected transcripts of the talks as well. I have done a few coursera courses and the supplementary materials here are minimal. Also, in the week 4, it is confusing to have the video transcript in the assigment section - very unclear whether that's a part of the assigment or not.",4
13829,"I finished this course in a single day in roughly about 8 hours, including taking notes and doing writing assignments. The material is quite good, more geared towards the beginner to the concepts of Plot. But, in my favorite parts - the interviews with Amity Gaige and Amy Bloom, I discovered new sides and tones to Character and Setting. And, they now compel me towards doing the rest of the courses in this specialization.I really wish I could submit my assignments even without the certificate version of the course.Thank you Mr. Skyhorse and the Coursera team. :)",4
13830,Extremely innovative exercises and guidelines. Really opens one s brain to think creatively. The intructions for assignments need a bit more clarification.A worthy ue of hard earned money.Thanks Coursera,4
13835,A lot of great insights on the way a team functions and generates ideas and projects. The format of this MOOC is quite original (discussion between a few speakers) and stimulating. I,4
13841,I think the process of the class is a bit too fast and it is hard for beginners to catch up,4
13845,Great course,4
13846,"Advanced level academic style statistics course. I liked the mathematical style of the course, which also brings me to the only one critics I have. The course is lacking a bit intuitive explanations. Otherwise, totally recommendable.",4
13847,did not find too much about the bio part,4
13851,"I enjoyed the course. I wish there was perhaps a little more evaluation along the way (maybe occasional in-lecture questions), but otherwise very nice.",4
13853,"Good course, needs updating, since it was a first generation course. Worth taking, but make sure to review a bit of Calculus, especially integration.",4
13854,Thank you very much for your course. It is clear and to the point.But it was very difficult to perceive a video-lectures of 30 minutes.,4
13855,I wish this Johns Hopkins course is more interactive. Like the Ohio State Calculus One class.,4
13857,"It's a really good, well-paced course.",4
13877,Real basics. Not certificate worthy though..,4
13880,Great course,4
13881,"The content is very useful for beginners. Moreover, the material is very good, nevertheless the links target in PDFs cannot be reached.",4
13882,Very interesting,4
13884,The course is great but there are some serious glitches happening in the Coursera platform that desperately need attention. I just went from showing that I did not pass the peer review section and in the next second was greeted by a big green Course Completion Certificate.,4
13885,"A good place to start of your entry to Data Science. You get to know what data science is, what are the tools used and get an idea of what can be done and cannot be done. The course even walks you through installation of r, rstudio, and git. It introduces version control system using Github too.",4
13887,"Some detail of the Quiz and course project were not mentioned in those video courses, it made me have to google or find out the answer in other ways. But through this, I did learned more .",4
13892,What I like (so far) is that you have to search for information via internet and by practising your knowledge in GIT and GIThub you can discover what you have learned or what should improve.,4
13894,Good introduction to data science stuff.,4
13898,"greet efforts to learn us about Data Scientist's Toolbox, thank you very muchjust one comment, it's about the instructor talking speed .. it was too fast and was not easy to keep focus.",4
13908,nice and short course,4
13910,Elaborate introduction to the data science arsenal of tools. Thank you so much.,4
13911,Gives an excellent overview to Data science course and what it take to become a Data scientist. Well organised videos and instructions,4
13912,Progress is a bit too slow.,4
13915,Gave me a good introduction to basic Git and GitHub operations,4
13917,"More exercises should be given, not just theory",4
13926,A good introduction to the world of Data Science!,4
13929,Good introduction to the Data Science and the courses provided here in Coursera,4
13933,It was good as an introductory course.,4
13935,Pls teach little more in depth. Little more.,4
13937,Great way to get started on the Data Science course with the right tools.,4
13943,Very Good for basic understanding of Data Science and the tools used by Data Scientists.,4
13945,"Overall the course is very good and well paced, but I believe it could be a bit more clear in the git and github lessons on how to push from your local repository to your remote one",4
13948,Very introductory - can finish the class well before the 4 weeks are over.,4
13949,"Great course, you get to learn about the tools used in the Data Science specialisation.",4
13950,"Good course, that brings goos insights on the basics about data science.The lectures about Git and GitHub are not so clear - maybe this classes would better fit when the class already have a more advanced knowldge on the course's theme.Thank you for the quality of the lessons and to make it available.",4
13956,More code and figure would be good for understanding.,4
13967,Good overview... ready to get to the real work...,4
13969,Excellent introduction... Cant wait to get going on the next course.,4
13971,"It is a really nice course if you plan to complete all the 10 courses in the Data Science Specialization track. As a standalone, It is not that great a course as it basically introduces you to different things and you need to do other courses to actually learn something.",4
13976,"Helps install and set up the necessary software, but does require you to do bit of searching on the web to completely understand certain aspects of the course.",4
13986,I like the pace and content.,4
13987,Good course.,4
13992,"Audio level is too low and not balance, ever worser then udemy, please fix it asap.",4
13993,It would be better if we can attempt the assignments even if we are not enrolled to the course. It would really help us to evaluate ourselves about the extent to which we have understood the concepts.,4
13995,Good introduction.,4
14009,"With my background, this was a lot of repetition of information that I already knew, but I was happy to have the reminder and it would be an excellent introduction to the specialization for others who do not have as much of a data science/computer science background. Overall, I feel that the course was worth my time and I feel it is a great start to the Data Science Specialization.",4
14013,Learn quite a few new things.,4
14014,"Great course, but maybe there should be a better explanation of git.",4
14017,Things got a bit hazy when it came to adding the .md file to our data science repo on GitHub. Other than that I enjoyed the course.,4
14021,This is a good overview of the Data Science track.,4
14022,I wish the instructors can be more clear with the Git and Github part. I still don't fully understand how to use Github for various tasks.,4
14024,Good intro to basic tools. Would like more exercises.,4
14030,"It was good - I think I would like a bit more on Github, but it gets covered in other courses. It shall have more material on the coverage of data science.",4
14033,"Good course! Lectures are easy to follow, have good instructions,",4
14034,A good course to set up your software tool kit before you start your dive into Data Science Specialization,4
14038,"While this course is introductory to a specialization, I believe there is more curriculum that should have been covered in this course.",4
14044,This is a very good introductory course for all those who are eager learn about Data Science. It gives you good insights.,4
14045,Easy to follow overview.,4
14049,It was a good starter course.,4
14050,its a detailed and the lectures are good at explaining the complex concepts in easy way to understand,4
14054,Great to start with.,4
14057,This Course is a great start for the specialization. The course is designed in a very thought manner so as to help a novice understand concepts easily. Thanks!,4
14058,It would be better if more details included in the lecture on Git and Github.,4
14059,Good introduction. The rest of the speciality is harder.,4
14062,"The lessons were very informative and well organized. I only wish the audio were louder for some of the videos from Jeff Leek. Other than that, excellent course.",4
14068,"Great experience so far, this is my first time in an online course.",4
14069,"Coursera has changed the way of learning,Yes anyone can learn anything and everything at the comfort of their own time and place......Thanks Team COURSERA....Keep Going....",4
14070,Great course,4
14073,low voice,4
14074,Simple introduction to the tools used in the specialization.,4
14076,Super friendly to new beginners with clear definitions and easy-following learning path. Although a bit of slow for me. I'd recommend anyone without programming background to launch their study in data science with this course.,4
14084,"A little bit simple, but maybe it is enough for an introduction course.",4
14085,course is good... need to include video on Rstudio setup on windows,4
14088,Great course to learn the nuts and bolts of Data Science.,4
14091,Very instructive and interessant course,4
14094,Its a good course those who prefer to study online.It gives a basic knowledge about the data tools which are going to be used.,4
14095,"So far so good, Git was a bit difficult to get going but I'm excited to continue with the specialization.",4
14100,The course is a real beginner's guide to the world of data science and gives a good introduction to some of the tools used by data scientists.,4
14105,Very good foundation material.,4
14109,"It was a little to easy and the quizzes were not really necessary. Questions like ""What courses are in the Data-Science Specialization?"" don't help to controll my learning progress. However for a first, introducing course it was okay. R Programming is way more interesting and challenging <3",4
14110,Good startup course,4
14113,"Very thoughtful and well-executed course. Although, one of the professor's voice is not very clear.",4
14119,Pretty helpful . But 4 weeks is an awful lot of time for the content being taught in this course,4
14121,Excellent primer course....just the entree...harder stuff is coming,4
14122,Very basic. I am hoping it helps guide my time commitment for further classes.,4
14131,Great class. Nice introduction to Data Science.,4
14137,good to get the basic setup of R and git in place,4
14139,The course is a nice set up for tools and environments that you need for other data science courses.,4
14141,Course content is good. I was able to get the basic understanding of git and github and also understood how it works.,4
14143,"Very nice introduction! Unlike a lot of online courses, this course is no fluff or jargon. It is solid stuff with hands on experience. I only wished this course was longer. After completing the 10-week Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, this course felt a bit too short. :-)",4
14149,Very basic but needed for people not introduced to R! Thank you!,4
14152,It was a good introduction. Looking forward to the rest of the course.,4
14153,Basic understanding of Data Science.,4
14158,This course did give me some useful tool information.,4
14159,My first online course and it could not have been any better. Gives me the confidence that I can learn online and add to my knowledge new things. Course material was explained in simple terms which is not the case always.,4
14161,Good intro.,4
14164,Great initial course.,4
14170,Very interesting,4
14171,"Pretty light weight so far, but I certainly understand it's targeted at a broad range of people so the vanilla material is probably a chore for some.",4
14172,Very good in setting up for the next courses. I would like to see more on Git though because I could have definitely understood it a bit better,4
14176,"It's the basic introduction courses for data science and it's good, we can learn a lot from this.",4
14185,Great approach to the course!,4
14189,"I knew most of the material in this course already, but I thought it was a good introduction to some of the tools that data scientists use.",4
14196,"The narration and content are excellent. The clarity of the slides has given neat direction steps to installing the software. However, I was not able to co relate the Command Line Interface with the R console after installation. I was overwhelmed with the huge list of commands immediately after software installation. The Week 3 videos have great information but lacks a coherence with the remaining course content.",4
14200,Lots of information. I learned quite a lot. It was a nice and informative introduction to Data Science in all aspects technically and theoretically.,4
14204,A good checklist for the basic tools of data science.,4
14206,Quite a fast course. Material is a lot though and would be quite daunting for someone completely new to this sort of stuff.,4
14208,Great instructors...very well done!,4
14215,"Are you ever tired of long-winded professors, focusing on a lecture for an hour or more, or spending hundreds of dollars for a class? Well, this course gives you the structure of a course, but the video lectures are concise, the topic is to get you in the door for data science, and all of my questions were answered quickly. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn data science.",4
14223,"I wouldn't really call this a course, rather it's more like an introduction to the very basic tools of the trade.",4
14225,"Very informative, a good start",4
14227,Nice course. Clean information e right forward on necessary.,4
14229,"Simple and very straight forward, I belive this is the best way to give a starting point course",4
14234,One of the best course to get into the field of Data Science.,4
14235,Good course for the basics of R and learning Github.,4
14239,"This course provide a good introduction to github , Rstudio and command line interface.it also gives a information about different ways to analyse data.",4
14242,The Data Scientist's Toolbox is a good introduction into Data Science specialization and gives a glimpse of what can be expected from the other modules. Looking forward to other modules.,4
14244,really interesting to study and learn new things,4
14246,The course introduced us to data science questions and got us to know collaborating with peers using Git Hub,4
14252,Good course; homework exercises are not particularly challenging.,4
14259,This is a good intro to programming so far. It feels like I'm building a solid base from which to understand R.,4
14261,Great course to get you setup - don't expect to learn anything besides getting the correct software and file sharing profile.,4
14267,Good introduction to the entire track.,4
14274,"This is a clear introductory course, but the content is not as much as expected. Compared with other coursera course, this one is like one-week pack.",4
14279,"Great intro to Data Science Specialization. Hoping to complete the other courses as well. Dispels my myth about Data Science is all geeky stuff. Looking forward to bust more myths.This course is light, broad and introductory. 4 weeks is a sweet spot. Keeps you engaged.",4
14281,Please add more non-medical examples,4
14285,"This is my first course on Coursera so i didn't really know what to expect and i apologise in advance for my ignorance. The course only takes you 8-10 hours or so to complete (even accounting for reading external sources) spread across a month. I enjoyed it, but it doesn't feel like i learned a lot and i think it could be a bit more intensive. Looking forward to R Programming (part 2)",4
14300,Good for introduce you to Data Scientist,4
14303,"I've just started this course, that's why my rating is 4/5. But I'm very satisfied with the video lecture, and I find it very interesting so far.",4
14304,"Very good pace, sequencing, and mix of lecture and practice. Only suggestion is a bit more time on the ""Add"", ""Commit"", which appears to be a very core element of file handling/version management with GitHub.",4
14308,"I found the way in which John Hopkins present the course, very valuable. Well structured, although the pace is quite fast !",4
14314,Gives a very good overview.,4
14334,"Good course for an introduction, the next course in the data scientist specialisation gets better.",4
14335,Very interesting,4
14336,This was a good basic overview and orientation for the rest of the specialization.,4
14338,Ideal course to get you started for a data science specialisation. Informs about and helps you install all the required softwares.,4
14339,the course was very informative.,4
14348,"Very good introduction. It is a very basic, but much needed step. Setting up the tools you will need.",4
14349,Pretty great introductory course on types of data analysis. I can't wait to see how this builds in the future courses of the specialization.,4
14353,"Good introduction to basics. A few improvements are warranted:Lessons could be reordered in a more logical progression, particularly when it comes to Git.Gitbash is not easy or intuitive. A more structured approach (e.g. with cheat sheets, command glossaries, structure diagrams, debugging algorithms etc) would help assimilate it.",4
14356,"This is a good course for someone who is not familiar with the basics of Git,Github and needs to install R,Rstudio and related packages. If you are not the kind of person described above you will be able to breeze through the course very fast.",4
14358,Good Introductory course!!!,4
14375,I would've liked some practical assignments on using Git/Github.,4
14377,It was excellent course. I gained new information. I believe it need's hand on practice and base information for beginners who does not have any back ground.,4
14379,"Not much to learn, I would have liked a more thorough introduction to data science's principles.Yet, everything is really presented step by step to make sure that all participants install correctly all tools needed for the further classes included in the specialization.",4
14380,Nice intro but i think only if you want the whole specialization.,4
14383,I felt I learn some basics but nothing new or indepth,4
14385,"I enjoyed it a lot, but I want more!",4
14387,Covers the basic effectively.Hope it's useful for the upcoming courses,4
14388,"A gentle start to the 10-course data science specialization. Would not recommend taking the course just by itself. If you're planning on the specialization, it's a great way to easy in.",4
14390,Great to develop the fundamentals!,4
14393,An Introduction needed.,4
14394,Very informative and the course begins with very basic stuff,4
14398,Good introductory course to get started on the Data Science Specialization.,4
14400,"Useful introduction to the world. Could have been a bit longer and gone into more detail about a variety of other factors is my only comment, but overall pretty happy with it.",4
14403,Informative. Making it more elaborate in terms of coding would be helpful.,4
14405,"More number of hours are given than required. Good learning for non IT field people. For people with IT background, its too easy.",4
14406,"Started out a bit slow with material that I felt was somewhat extraneous, but then got to the good part (hard part?) of installing R and getting it working with GIT.",4
14414,Usefull introduction Course. Course material is clear.,4
14415,Covers the basics,4
14417,Great. It was easy and interesting .,4
14418,Good start for the beginners especially for people new to the data science. Topic are not covered in depth but as its just a introductory course so its totally fine..,4
14423,Great course! well paced and timing appropriate. Quizes reflected taught lessons.,4
14430,"It is very clear and useful course. It holds one hand to go sure through the contents. Anyway, I would suggest to end at certain point doing something simple in R, to give an end to this chapter in this story.",4
14431,"nice course, but it would be better if the teacher can give us more details more about git and github",4
14433,"It's a good course, but it might be a little too introductory for someone who already has some familiarity with programming (although I hadn't used R, I had other experience with a similar language). So for me, I completed this course much more quickly than I anticipated and was really just very eager to move on to the other courses in the specialization.",4
14435,good starter course,4
14438,Good course stuff. A little bit too fundamental for a programmer.,4
14443,"A nice slow intro to Coursera, but not a ton of actual content. Good to get your feet wet, but skippable if you are familiar with the basics of the toolbox or taking courses on Coursera.",4
14451,This is a basic course but since this is what it is design to be it is ok.,4
14458,It is a good introduction to the Data Scientist Tools and processes.,4
14460,"Well basically tutors only providing slides, speech, forums and ebook in this course...rest is self-learning, self-understanding, self-asking... if not, then you'll not pass this course i think..",4
14461,"A solid course to kick off the specialization, but not worth taking on it's own.",4
14465,A really basic course many programmers know all about this already.,4
14470,"Very clear introduction for those unfamiliar with R, RStudio, Git, GitHub and the basics of statistical analysis.",4
14471,"good introduction, as introduction courses go",4
14481,"Pretty good. Some lectures were good, a couple seemed rushed. Covered the basics OK.",4
14486,Very enlightening of a course for those starting their journey as a data scientist or analyst.,4
14488,It is quite good for a start up,4
14490,Very introductory,4
14497,Helpful introduction to people who have little experience with GitBash and R,4
14500,"Maybe too easy for some people, but is ok to ensure a minimum level in order to enroll other courses in the specialization.",4
14503,Good course. I would recommend it to others.,4
14505,"It's a good course, you're not going in-depth but this is just an introductory course for the Data Science master and the tools you will use. You will learn the basics of Git and get acquainted with R and is thus somewhat essential for starters.",4
14506,Good course,4
14509,Great course,4
14514,No all the videos have spanish traduction,4
14516,great intro to stats concepts for data science and the programs. No real coding taught in this though.,4
14517,I would recommend it to any one. The introductory course is so basic that some might see it not important but the course has done a well job by easily getting across the foundation of Data Science as well as helping non-programmers to easily drift into this field. I would have given 5 Star if i was allowed to attempt my tests even though i am auditing the course. The only thing coursera should benefit from is providing the certificate. By freedom of giving test and doing courses people will surely pay for one course or another when they get more confident with their results in audited course.,4
14524,very practical and useful introduction,4
14529,"Good introduction to data science, however it should have more details and practical examples about Git.",4
14530,"A light introduction to the Data Science field, in many ways it can be difficult for inexperienced people with software or inexperienced with stats - in my case it was not very difficult since some of the topics were already familiar.The course can be done in a couple of days if the topics are already familiar, in my opinion the course's contents are perfect for someone very new to this field.I would have rated more stars if the course's content was more ""objective"" for people unfamiliar with the subject - other than that it's perfect.",4
14534,Just an introduction course but helpful in setting up the rest of the specialization.,4
14535,Good course for a first contact with the Data Science world !,4
14538,"This course was a great intro to these concepts and helpful guide to getting things set up and getting used to the MOOC format, as well! A few times it seemed like the slides jumped right in while skipping over a bit of context, but was able to orient myself with some googling and asking friends some basic questions to figure things out.",4
14539,"Good introduction, tells you what Data Science actually is. Also teaches you basics of GitHub, R and Rstudio.",4
14540,"Thank you, this is Course good",4
14544,I would have liked more information and a broader understanding,4
14547,A great introduction to tools such as git and GitHub,4
14549,Too Simple for Professional,4
14550,Good introductory course for the specialization.,4
14555,It was not harder... but It is a great start.,4
14557,Expectations for simply meeting the baseline learning objectives or to outpoint it aren't exactly clear and there are two monitor strings that are far from being clear (15 minute guide on xyz).Content and evaluations match in requirements. I learned a lot about softwares and databases in with which I can learn and work.,4
14567,Good introductory course pointing to background reading materials and providing context for following courses as well as supporting the installation of the required software tools.,4
14571,Great course that allows an introduction into the world of the data scientist. Some instructional videos could be improved.,4
14574,should contain more tutorials about Git and GitHub functionality.,4
14584,Good and relatively easy course. Perfect to establish personal confidence.,4
14585,"Nice course, sets you up with the basics for R programming, and sets you up with all the tools. Basic introduction to Git makes it interesting.Overall, great.",4
14598,"I liked the course, it was simple and to the point.",4
14599,This course provides very nice and useful tools for data analysis!,4
14602,"Excellent Course for learning Basics. I had no previous experience with software, computers aside from surfing web, checking e-mails and some Microsoft Office. I'd recommend this course to anyone Interested in data-science or coding in general. The course is easy but not too easy the frustration of dealing with computers exists and I feel it was important for myself to struggle a little bit. I followed the advice of the instructors and sought out solutions to issues. I spent twenty hours a week but if you are tech savvy, take good notes, follow directions and everything goes as planned you could possibly get through the course in a lot less time. There are also a lot of people willing to help. The course shows you how to seek out help efficiently. I didn't request any help this time around had I done so I would have spent half as much time on the course.",4
14603,Good base formation for beginners.,4
14606,"The course itself only introduces the main aspects and helps with installation of the tools, while no actual programming is taught. But it is useful for having better understanding of the following courses in the specialization.",4
14610,Basics are given utmost interest,4
14615,Consistent yet very basic course. I would only recommend this course if you are willing to complete the whole Data Science specialization or if you have troubles with the basic functioning of GitHub.,4
14618,"Too basic, but I liked it!",4
14624,It would be better if they are these practice teaching in detail.,4
14625,Good introduction to the Specialization,4
14627,Good initial overview and setup for the rest of the series.,4
14631,"All excellent and a very good introduction. I wish I was able to get my quiz graded without having to pay just to see if I was learning. For the rest, I recommended for a great intro.",4
14632,Good Basic Course,4
14633,"With my background I found this part of the course rather slow, but I can see why it's necessary for people with less of a software background.",4
14635,"This course is a very basic introduction, but I think it is an importa",4
14637,"It's a very introductory course and in a sense I don't feel like I learnt something useful, except the part that shows how to install all the tools that are needed for the rest of the Specialization.",4
14638,"This course is perfect for really newbie. However, it also answers the question of ""What is Data Science?""",4
14639,Good cours for a starter,4
14641,"It was good, well-executed course, but it was too basic. I expected more.",4
14649,Audited the course successfully :),4
14652,"Important note: Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation. It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course. You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here.In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation. The video lectures for setting up R, RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account).",4
14655,Good course for starters. Can be more detailed.,4
14663,Well paced and well taught.,4
14667,"Would have bee nice if it included a bit more ""in Git"" tutorials, but that is easily figured out when left to one's own devices.",4
14677,"The videos might not seem a lot at first view, but they contain links to some of the most useful material out there. The mentors on discussion boards are immensely helpful as well. For the uninitiated in data sciences, this is a great module to begin with.",4
14678,The course is well structured but for investigation methods purposes some subjects should be improved and more clear considering that not all of us have deep statistics knowledge.,4
14682,"Nice course, but at the end it is just introductory course, so i am waiting for the coming one",4
14685,"A great starting. Perfect for providing a foundation. However, instead of slideshow, a few real-time videos would have been better.",4
14696,"Good, but would like a step by step walkthrough for MAC/Windows when setting up the final assignment to ensure everything is correct.",4
14697,"This was a useful & interesting course, Thank you.",4
14703,quite a beginning to a journey.,4
14705,"Succeeds in conveying course prerequisites, contents and benefits.",4
14709,Overall this is a great introductory course to Data sciences.,4
14710,"A good basic class and collection of the tools. I wish there had been a little more explanation of what we would use the software for, but I found the lecture parts to be both concise and informative.",4
14723,Good overview of the specialization. Probably very good for someone new to R and software development tools in general.,4
14726,A good but brief introduction to a number of useful skills. I learned a lot in a short amount of time but I still have a long way to go. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of communication with a TA or instructor. The message boards were desolate and could not support any kind of a robust discussion of the conceptual issues involved with data science.,4
14731,This course has given me a basic knowledge of different tools and statistical techniques that data scientist use to play with data.,4
14734,pretty simple overview of data science tools,4
14736,Very excellent startup to motivate a one want to become data scientist,4
14737,"Good introduction into basic data science tools and a nice starting point for the data science specialization. Yet, the certificate is a little bit overpriced.",4
14738,"Fine as a general introduction, but not a lot to it. Good explanations of how to use github and get set up.",4
14739,Very helpful introduction to downloading R and Data Science concepts.,4
14740,"I is not so difficult for a beginner, but I suggest it could be more information in the course.",4
14742,Good introduction to these concepts and tools.,4
14751,"Overall, I liked being exposed to Github and GitBash. I felt this course gave me a broad overview of what to expect in the future!",4
14754,"Very basic, but interesting.",4
14757,Good introduction.,4
14763,I ran into a few unexplained issues with final project but a very good course overall.,4
14764,Helpful for people with no experience on the subject matter. Very straight forward and easy to follow.,4
14765,A very good intro course but must be priced lesser when compared to the other courses in the specialization.,4
14766,"Straightforward, interesting, and easy to follow. I wish it were a bit more challenging.",4
14773,Great intro. Too bad you need to pay in order to get quiz answer or statement of accomplishment.,4
14775,"It's a good introduction to data science. However, without prior knowledge of statistics, programming, and research methods the course would be fairly difficult to follow.",4
14776,"The course is excelent for people who don't know anything about R, Rstudio, RmarkDown, Git, GiHub and other tools. However, for people who already know a little bit of those technologies, they will find it a little repetitive. Anyhow, the classes are awesome for you to get to learn to use those tools. Congratulations to the team.",4
14779,A good Introduction to Data science,4
14781,"Good Introductory Class, all though I think some of the videos were too fast. Need to provide more explanation on some of the slides.",4
14786,"I found this course to have very useful material and good, clear explanations. My only criticism is that the last of the four weeks has practically no content. There are no lectures and the only assignment is grading the assignments of other students, which at most takes 20 minutes.",4
14791,Great!,4
14796,There were lectures about how to install R and RStudio on Mac and Windows. And the quiz asked about information on these lectures. You must pay attention to them even if you have previously installed them.,4
14798,Very informative,4
14802,Very useful course to pursue Data scientist career path and,4
14811,I think you have to say more about git commands and their syntax,4
14817,Good introduction. Good to learn the way it works....,4
14818,"Good pace for the first course. A little more guidance on Git command flow would be help. However, the available Help documentation on Github did the trick. The problem was having to work primarily in the command line which provides limited feedback.",4
14820,"I enjoyed the course - I wish there were more exercises, but hopefully they'll come in the next courses of this specialization.",4
14824,Experimental Design is very great. Other contents are just fundamental for beginners.,4
14825,"Nice course for Beginners, No complains regarding course material, however there is little bit audio issue in some slides as it is bit low.",4
14827,This course is great to start with. It provides overview of what is in the course and how should we as students be prepared to learn the course.,4
14830,Audited only.,4
14835,The course covered the foundations well especially how and what softwares to install etc. I would have given five stars if the course contains covered some extra details about R and datascience.,4
14842,"Practical to do if you are continuing with specialization. Ensures all students have the correct setup, which is important. I'm not sure how useful it would be on its own though.",4
14845,Very good introduction to Data Science!,4
14847,A pretty good introduction.,4
14849,"Too basic, but still informative.",4
14850,a brief and yet organized and good resource for review old skills i have learnt and new skills that can acquire from here.,4
14851,was too easy!,4
14855,This was a great introduction to the tools. Just don't expect to actually do any analysis yet.,4
14857,Good course. I've learnt many things.,4
14869,Good start but not very hard if you already programmed bevore,4
14870,"Assignments are useful, background is interesting, but meat of it is nothing you can't get from googling ""Data Science""",4
14874,A good introduction to the subject area. It would be nice to see more real-life examples.,4
14875,The first week's quiz is really difficult and I had to go through the lecture material several times. Because of the great number of very short lectures it is difficult to find an asnwer to sought question.,4
14877,It very basic but still very useful,4
14878,It's a good start to the data science specialization.,4
14886,Great course although very basic.,4
14888,It shows the major tools to use in real life to program with R.,4
14889,A good start!,4
14893,"This is a fantastic course, being a person who already works with loads of data I can surely stand by the statement that ""This is a fantastic base line to all your data needs""",4
14897,Basic introduction...,4
14904,"This was a very professionally done course. It is *very* introductory, which is either good or bad, depending on how you feel about it.",4
14906,Good introduction to tools if you don't know them already. Otherwise very remedial.,4
14907,Good course to start the data studies,4
14916,A good theory on data usage.,4
14917,Good course. Short and sweet. Nice to be able to access future weeks' lessons and finish ahead of schedule if you wish to.,4
14920,"It covers some basics, but doesn't go deep into anything. Definitely take the other courses in the specialization to go deeper.",4
14928,Content is very nice.,4
14931,"Very basic survey and mostly just setting up software, but confidence-boosting and fun",4
14934,I expected more detailed use of Github - otherwise great course.,4
14938,"Good course, but it needs to be more difficult and more in depth.",4
14939,Very good start in the Data Science world,4
14941,"Good start, looking to dig in more, as I already have a background in stats data analysis and data viz.",4
14942,Good introduction,4
14943,"The course is in fact an overall intro to the full data science specialization. Some of the content are useful; but some of the quiz questions are not very informative, and don't really test on stats...",4
14951,A basic introductory course,4
14958,"Good courses and necessary for people like me who never have a relation to computer science,,, But it is a waste of money...lol",4
14968,Really good starting point for R,4
14974,The course is very nice and provides all that you need to get started on Data Science. Looking forward to the next set of courses. Thanks!,4
14976,"Getting things set up is not that exciting, but a necessary part of it. I'm looking forward to learning more.",4
14983,Very helpful overview of the subject.,4
14985,"This introductory course is a good overview, goes pretty quickly through the basics, and gets you prepped for delving deeper in the subject matter. Planning to sign up for the next course in this certificate program.",4
14986,"Basic tools for shareing and develop that right now I don´t consider usefull. In the other hand, the content is well explained so right now I new how to use new tools.",4
14987,"Too little information, i think course need to be a bit bigger",4
14988,Fast tour around the Data Scientist world.,4
14990,"Good introductory course, but could offer a bit more of a challenge, with actual (basic) problems. Learned about R, although not programming, and more about GitBash and GitHub.",4
15000,Very mechanical in nature. Worth doing though as it provides essential building blocks for the remainder of the specialisation.,4
15001,Great for getting all your software set up.,4
15002,"The instructors are great, but I think the content of this course should be embbeded in other module. Despiting being important, the topics covered here are very introductory. I recognizes, though, they are important to align expectation and to put everyone in a minimum ground of knowledge. However, I am not sure if Coursera should charge US$ 29,00 for it.",4
15003,"The course is great, I just think the course should has a little more content to be perfect.",4
15012,"An essential introduction to the rest of the specialization program, but not too much information included in the course by itself.",4
15014,This was useful.,4
15026,"I found this course a fairly easy introduction to the tools you will need for this series of courses, however I already had a rudimentary knowledge of Linux and Bash Shells. For the computer novice this may be more daunting. The one area that is worth spending some time on as an investment for the future is git and git-hub. Understanding how these work together is not transparent. It took me a while to figure out what I had to do to push committed files to a remote site. I think suggested reading could be more specific to guide people in this area.",4
15027,"Gives a great foundational overview of what Data Science is, as well as getting your technical environment set up for the future classes in the Data Science Specialization path.",4
15033,Very good place to start. Tells you just enough to get started and also just enough to get hands dirty to keep learning.,4
15034,Covers great data science concepts.,4
15035,Great course!!!!,4
15042,"Easy to follow. Might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful for even those who have experience.",4
15043,Gives a good intro to Data Science and makes sure you get the essential tools downloaded.,4
15045,good introduction,4
15058,"Slides and videos are a bit insufficient in order to finish course projects.Apart from that, this course is awesome!",4
15073,Clear and concise. Can be completed in a very short period of time.,4
15074,It's a good preview.,4
15075,"A little basic, but necessary to get everything you need set up for the next classes in the series. And it does that well enough.",4
15080,Good introduction class.,4
15081,"Good overview, I appreciated that the course gets you set up and makes you prove it. More command line and RStudio simple exercises would be nice.",4
15082,"This course is good to get all your programs set up before you start your studies in Data Science.I think it could offer a little bit deeper knowledge of git and github in order to guarantee it will not be a problem later, since they will not be strictly related to data science.",4
15093,Great start to the Tools.,4
15094,A good start.,4
15096,Great Course! Overall I would recommend. Had a little bit of trouble b/c I am using a Mac but after a few Google Searches I was on my way!,4
15097,"Very good composed, explains in a very good manner the complex topic, a general overview about the tools and their connection to each other would be great and helping, as there are many tools to install and understand the functions.",4
15099,Good introduction!,4
15105,"I would expect some more methodological material,\though everything else is fine",4
15107,"In the course they use some tools' older versions and, for example, some Git commands shown on video are different in newer Git versions.",4
15113,A bit easy but a good base. Motivating start.,4
15114,"Gives you the tools you need to learn the rest of the courses, by itself is completely useless",4
15122,"it's well done, i was expecting more details in the lessons while students it's requested to search many things on internet in order to learn, for instance GitBash. However it's a good first course",4
15125,I appreciate the opportunity to study in this institution.,4
15126,Very Interesting and I continuing to learn,4
15127,Decent starting course for beginners.,4
15133,"It's fine, but mabe quite easy. 4 Weeks are too much. This course could be done in a couple of days.",4
15138,Super basic introduction. I liked the last section reviewing data science methods and conceptual ideas.,4
15141,Great primer on how to get started.,4
15144,"Great introduction to the different tools that a data scientist will encounter and use, including RStudio, Git, and GitHub. I would have appreciated more practical experience linking Git and GitHub, as that is critical for version control of code.",4
15150,"Pretty easy, but totally necessary information needed to continue down the track.",4
15157,This course is good if you have zero background in R and using GitHub. It'll walk you through installing what's necessary and give you basic tips on how to use them.,4
15159,"The Data Scientist’s Toolbox is a great way to dip into Data Science and the methodology behind it. The course is very general, and makes an effort to cover the bigger scope of things without delving deep in any. More than anything, it's a great way to learn the components and uses of data science and set a framework for all that will be coming after.The materials are very well laid-out and almost feel like attending college classes. The visuals and slides are a little dry, but the pace is lively enough to maintain momentum at all times.",4
15160,It's a very superficial introduction.,4
15161,The course was very helpful and instructions were concise and easy to understand. Great for those fumbling around to scour the net for which tools to start with.,4
15163,"Good introduction to data science, primary tools and what the spec. course is about.",4
15175,"It is unfortunate that I was only able to audit this course and not take it for free without the Coursera certificate, as it is currently not possible for me to pay for the whole course.",4
15177,Good course to start your basic understanding of Data Science.,4
15183,"Just shows you how to install rstudio and github, rather slow-paced.",4
15187,"I think more detail statements are needed on PDF.Because I'm not good at listening, so I studied by PDF.",4
15188,It is a good Introductory.,4
15191,A good course for identifying the field of data science and introducing the computing tools of the trade.,4
15193,Well. I don't think this could be categorized as a course. You can think of it as table of content for the specialization.,4
15195,Good starting point for the Data Science,4
15200,Informative and helps people like me who are willing to learn from scartch. The course content though can do with a little more updation.,4
15207,Interesting to know about Data Scientist and the tools. Eagerly waiting to go through the next lesson,4
15209,"Quite simple. It could be more engaging.When downloading PDF slides, links in them should be clickable.",4
15216,Walks you step by step getting you setup and familiar with the core software.,4
15227,Useful couple of modules for helping you get set up with R and Git/GitHub. Really doesn't require a full month to do.The quizzes were pointless.,4
15233,Good Course,4
15235,Very informative course. The Quiz questions however may not be necessarily be in the course content.,4
15237,This course is a great introductory course for data scientists.,4
15241,The course was nice but seemed too trivial at times of discussion about basic tools like git and command line interfaces.,4
15242,"The course content is very useful, but explanations are short and It's unclear how to install R studio for the Windows (I found it at Youtube). Also I had a problem how to install the R packages, and solution was simple: you should run it as administrator (it wasn't in lecture).",4
15246,Great course! I would recommend compressing the audio on the video presentations so it's easier to hear and more consistent in volume level.,4
15251,"Great course, nice ease into the Data Science specialisation.",4
15253,"Good introductory course. Learnt a more structured approach to categorising statistical methods. Much of the rest of the content was a bit basic, though probably useful to fill in any knowledge gaps pre-course.",4
15254,Good starter but a bit slow paced (I think intentionally).,4
15256,It's a luring start for a series of courses.,4
15259,"Good overview of Data Science, but geared more towards people who have little background in computer science. Info that *was* presented was very thorough.",4
15260,"A simple introduction. Easy to cover very quickly, however important to understand the basics before progressing.",4
15262,Excellent introduction to the field of Data Science.,4
15264,"A brief introduction and overview of data science and the specialization from JHU. It provides necessary information and materials for the following courses, but itself does not cover much technique details. Won't take long to accomplish but still necessary if you don't know Git, Github or background of data science.",4
15267,Easy to follow and the discussion board is active.,4
15270,Good basic knowledge on data sc,4
15272,"Very easy going, but I think week 3 has much information, maybe a step by step toturial might help.",4
15277,A good Introduction to GitHub and Data Science,4
15281,The introduction was very precise and straight to the core concepts of data science.Please include a slide with the road map of becoming a data scientist.,4
15288,"I'm doing this training for the second time, now as a beta-tester. Particular comments about lecture content, problems, etc. have been put in every lecture.General comments, in short:1) Related to the new platform and UI design:_ It is cleaner and simpler than the previous one. I like it, BUT..._ It lacks of some useful features: saving intermediate results in quizzes before submit them; calendar; limited number of subforums._ The most relevant flaw: there are not downloadable versions of lecture slides. Unacceptable! No way to check most of the links we saw in slides (URLs not visible)._ Description and steps in course project appear ""too packed"" together. I prefer the former design.2) Related to content:_ The course is mainly for preparing students for the rest of data science specialization program. When you said ""toolbox"" you mean the concrete toolbox you will need to do the program. Some people expect to have a general introduction to data science but that is only a half of the content. I think this is clear enough in the presentation but for some reasons there are people in forums who protest the content, so maybe you should insist more in this fact._ I would like to suggest some kind of reorder of material: week 2 is all about installing a running tools and week 3 about key aspects of data analysis. Maybe you can split both types of content between wk2 and wk3 to make wk2 more appealing for not technical oriented students._ Git is a source of problems for a good portion of people. See my comments in lectures about how Git is explained.",4
15294,Excellent course. I do recommend this course for anyone who is interested in analytics.,4
15295,"I would prefer more coding example provided by the professor, I will be super useful.",4
15298,"The instructions for submitting through Tumblr are not specific enough, especially after Week 1.",4
15300,"As an English speaking student, I felt this course was easy to follow and translated a complex subject into a step by step process of interpreting data. I like the hands-on development of a research question and learning the SAS and PYTHON Data Analytic software coding to extrapolate information from data sets. I didn't like the fact that it was difficult to get an instructor to respond in the forums and very difficult figuring out how to contact Coursera with any problems.",4
15306,"The course is great otherwise, however the certificate of this course just completed 'Data Management and Visualization' with no mention about the skills learnt or the grade attained.Primary reason I enrolled to the course was to list 'SAS' (basic) as a skill in my resume, however the certificate does not mention anything about SAS. If at least the certificate said completed 'Data Management and Visualization with SAS', it would be a good value for money.I strongly recommend Coursera should look into this. Thanks!",4
15324,"I'd pick 3.7 or so, really. The applied nature of the course is nice if you have a project in mind and to see the programming you learn in action. Without it, it might not be worth it because you could learn a lot of the SAS programming for free from SAS itself using their beginning programming coursework offered online (in fact potential students may consider taking the SAS programming essentials course before taking this because you learn a lot about the SAS coding framework that comes in handy for this class).",4
15329,This course is very good especially for beginners getting started with SAS or python for data analytics. The lessons are very clear and easy to understand. Learnt a lot of valuable information and also enjoyed it.,4
15330,"It is a very nice course, although I was expecting something a little deeper / denser on both statistics and SAS programming. It is getting better on Module 2! =)",4
15335,It was really good.,4
15338,It was a great course for me! It gives a very important basic of statistic & visualization.I really appreciated the way it was presented.,4
15343,Choosing an actual research question allows you to find a topic of interest. This makes the content more meaningful and accelerates understanding of the concepts.,4
15345,"This course is very simplistic, but interesting. I was able to complete the first 3 modules within a week, however I am somewhat skilled in this area. I was looking for something more difficult. However, my main goal was learning these techniques in python. It was frustrating that it took so long until we actually produced graphs (I don't like just looking at tables). However, all in all, it was useful and interesting -- I really like the applications-based approach. You get to analyze data about whatever YOU are interested in!",4
15348,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",4
15349,there is not enough instruction of using SAS online~,4
15350,"Simple material, and nicely presented. Good choice for beginners",4
15351,"Simple and powerful Course. If you are a beginner. Just follow the instructions and Assignment Schedule. The course may seem a bit easy, if you are good at math and have some prior programming experience, yet you can be surprised with what new you learned by the end of the Course, considering the time you spend. Also you develop sound reasoning to answer your own questions regarding handling and presenting Data. The clarity you develop is worth it.",4
15352,"The content is easy to follow and is clearly explained without adding unnecessary complexity at this entry level. This specialization reaches its goals. Instead of trying to over achieve it keeps things simple.I would recommend taking the ""Data Science Specialization"" as the next step.",4
15360,I saw little interactions between students and in the discussion list. But I liked to learn a new language!,4
15367,Very good references - codebooks and examples.,4
15374,I really enjoyed this course. Have been using Python for years but never jumped into data management and visualization. This course helped me doing that and presenting results in a beautiful and useful way.I am not rating with 5 starts because the rating system is cumbersome. I submitted my first assignment late and they were not peers to review my work so I am still waiting after a month of rejoining the course.,4
15375,It is one of the most structured course that I have ever seen On line and is very simple to understand.,4
15379,this is not a review its my personal progress bar,4
15383,Wish they offered R,4
15402,Highly recommend this course.,4
15418,Great course -- wonderful overview of copyright (especially for someone who didn't take the course in law school)! I appreciated the teamwork displayed by the instructors and their clear knowledge of the relevant subject matter. I wish I could get Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credit for this course; it's so much better than most of the CLE I've taken!,4
15419,I want to learn this since my childhood days. Thanks for keeping this course for me.Love you coursera..,4
15421,"Great team and good information. Logically organized. I'd love to find a similar course for writers, not just educators and librarians.",4
15437,it was very useful course specially that content about construction technology trends and the guys delivered it very simple and covered almost most of construction management topics. can't wait to the next course from columbia university,4
15441,"Great course, I would just like to suggest more numerical examples on the Lean module",4
15448,Great introductory course on Construction management. I liked the module on technology trends the most.,4
15457,"Not all the parts are useful for European construction market, but it's very good quality information. Thank you!",4
15460,"Great content, well organized. I like the lecture with the visuals and the slides to review after the lecture.",4
15466,"Good introductory course. Light on details, but can't do without.",4
15467,Covered all key aspects of construction project management.,4
15475,"Interesting topics, most of the lectures felt topical and cited real world examples, would recommend to someone with limited PM experience.",4
15478,Very informative and very useful course. Full of knowledge packed. Thank You so much to all the teachers.,4
15489,"Amazingly covers all the areas and new advances in Construction field. I would still like to get in depth knowledge about new delivery systems like IPD, etc.",4
15502,Great Course,4
15505,This is so wonderful but i wish i would receive the printed copy of the certificate by post too.,4
15518,The course content was clearly and concisely taught. The professor expounded on concepts and gave applicable examples. The only suggestion that I would give is to provide downloadable slides in pdf format for each lecture video.,4
15525,This is a good starter for setting and framing your copyright policies if you work with Multimedia.,4
15532,Nice course. Important in today's digital world,4
15541,"The content is good. I learned a lot about copyright law. However, it annoys me that most of the time the instructors are looking at a piece of paper while discussing.",4
15558,Good oneVacob List is very good to remind myself.Thanks.,4
15564,Meetings is one of the most useful courses for all professionals.,4
15574,It is a very useful insight into community change in public health and a must for every one who want to ensure sustainability is integrated into his intervention,4
15578,It was a very informative course that helped me understand the principles behind community work. The use of case studies to explain concepts was what helped me the most.,4
15582,"Very useful course for those who work in the field and want to better structure their public health activities. Plan for more time than what is written if you really want to benefit from the case study homeworks, especially if you're a non-native (even good level) English speaker, but this should not stop you from taking the course: the topic is very well addressed and the examples tremendously relevant, not to say inspiring J!",4
15583,LOVE the topic/content. I would like more small assignments to solidify defining terms and ideas before applying the course ideas to case study samples. I would take more courses in this topic and similar topics!,4
15585,This course is ideal for anyone interested in community-oriented public health. It's worth the time and effort.,4
15593,"A well thought out course that was very illuminating. Not sure about the complexity of week 2's assignment, but overall good value.",4
15606,"Good course (I did the free version, full disclosure). Learned enough about character development to help me with my fiction - and non-fiction. I teach creative nonfiction and you need to understand how to make the people you use compelling. Wish there was more exposition, factual step-by-step and less interviewing. Liked the Plot class better for that reason",4
15608,"Excellent course. The video presentations are well done with information that is vital for developing the skill required to be an effective writer. They include videos that discuss concepts and interviews with successful writers. The assignments are challenging but enjoyable and well paced. This the second course I have taken in the specialization, and I am pleased with the big level of expertise that is shared by the instructors.",4
15622,"Typically writing courses deal with either the business of writing, or the pretentious art and literature side of writing. Almost nobody deals with the science of writing. Where is the talk on motivational arrows? Character likabilities like being unrelenting? Where is the meta-analysis of good techniques in writing? meta-data is the future of defining the science of writing, but it's not mentioned here even slightly. What about will he/won't he moments? Backstory interacting and being relevant to the plot? What about fish out of water? This course doesn't even touch upon foundational pillars and tenets that make good writing. I couldn't imagine paying for this course, since I've already paid too much with my time. As it stands, I could have taught a better course than this, and maybe some day I'll be so fortunate as to move writing studies in the right direction, towards the truth that older generation teachers are unwilling to accept: that good writing is empirical, and therefore can be learned.",4
15629,"I liked the course -- there were plenty of useful tips throughout. However, I felt some of the assignments were unnecessarily oblique and complicated (particularly the second assignment). Ultimately, it was a helpful course, though I feel much of the information, expectation, and specific instruction could be more streamlined.",4
15652,The material is interesting and relevant. I found the assignments challenging and the review questions slightly lengthy.,4
15655,This course was very interesting and the assignments were good. I thought it relied too much on conversations with other authors but overall it was enjoyable and I learned new skills.,4
15656,Liked this course. It helps to make sure character is central to the plot,4
15658,"Prof. Bloom was very interesting to watch and listen to. The course was well organized and free of technical issues, but it didn't seem quite as thorough a discussion of the topic as the plot course was. Very close to 5 stars.",4
15665,Very insightful .Thanks,4
15675,"I liked it overall, though there were some glitches and I was hoping that there'd be at least some feedback from course organizer.",4
15677,"I do not understand why these courses over lap. I finished #2 today, tried to start #3 but found that I had 10 hours to complete the first weeks assignment? Who is in charge out there?",4
15679,"Great insight into character, voice and connecting with our story. The professor also references books that can be read to further our understanding. The only drawback is that auditing students cannot participate in feedback on assignments.",4
15680,"I like Amy Bloom, but the lectures don't provide the explanations or the processes for creating characters. In the Craft of Plot, Skyhorse gave us the tools we need to develop plot and structure, and even how to start to develop characters. But in this course, the lectures don't do that. They seem more philosophical than instructional and all of the lectures go right over my head. Craft of Plot gave me hope, Craft of Character confused me.",4
15682,I enjoyed Amy Bloom's guidelines and am keen to create some well rounded characters. Thank you for enabling me to follow along without having to pay ( no evaluation of the assignments).,4
15689,"Overall, I enjoyed the class and the content. However, I found it difficult to get feedback on the homework assignments and there isn't a way to review what you missed on submitted assignments after the course is over. Students should be able to get a copy of the solutions for the weekly graded problem sets once the course is over to keep for their records and to review what they missed.",4
15713,"Very good, but some topics may need to be explained further, like the realization of the switches",4
15721,Really good again. Thanks EPFL team.,4
15740,"Great, easy way to learn style. Highly recommend.",4
15750,"I liked the course very much. For a foreign speaker, though, I found it particularly challenging. The nuances of words are particularly important when dealing with matters of style, and I struggled through the exercises, which I found a bit more ""abstract"" than those in preceding courses of this series. Maybe it was just self-consciousness... In any case, because I encountered this struggle, the course was helpful in making me think about how do I want to pursue my next steps in the process of creative writing -- should I continue in English, or should I try, instead, to do it in my native language? I am sure this is a question that many other students have asked themselves. I shouldn't conclude without saying that I do recommend the course, in any case.",4
15751,"I felt this course was slightly tough. When it comes to the degree of strictness in passing, I had my share. I thank God I finally passed, though some peers are very hard to convince.",4
15756,"I made comments in the discussion board which I think would help with the assignments. I would like to see the idea of ""style"" communicated a little better, but I haven't seen the fifth course yet to know where it's all supposed to finish.",4
15762,"Having completed all four CW modules, I feel this was a tad ""inferior"" to Character. High quality overall, as always.",4
15765,"This is the fourth class I've taken in the Creative Writing specialization program. As a whole, I enjoyed the class, with only a few notes to make. As with the other classes in the specialization, I feel the curriculum could be expanded upon, perhaps with assigned readings to help illustrate the points made in the lectures. Another thing I wish to note, albeit a minor one, is that the videos in this course particularly feel a bit cut up. It seems like several takes were combined into one video, which makes the overall presentation feel a bit jerky in comparison to other courses in the program.",4
15778,I was helped by the lessons regarding choosing words carefully.,4
15780,This course helped me in my writing. I enjoyed the feedback and the exercises.,4
15786,"Great course on the application of style in fiction writing. Professor does reference a few books for further understanding and example. He explains things well and in a concise way, sometimes with the use of simple diagrams. Very effective and useful assignments and topics. The only drawback is that auditing students cannot receive peer review internal to the course.",4
15792,I have lear,4
15796,easy to understand and a guide to complex courses related to financial engineering,4
15803,"Good explaining, very basic stuff. Readings are basically the same as lectures, but maybe help to really remember the knowledge. I recommend it for beginners in the area.",4
15805,My opinion about this course is very helpful for people who are in the corporate finance field.As a Finance specialization student it has been created practical knowledge.,4
15806,Great course!,4
15819,Excellent...Prof Javier is good. Concepts really well explained and as simple as possible ways !,4
15824,It could be a good review for me. I did this course before. Thanks!,4
15826,soon...basics of the introductory course for corporate finance.And highly recommend the suggested book written by the speaker Prof. Javish <understanding finance>,4
15828,"This is definitely a great course. Prof. Estrada explained the basic concepts very well. Extremely useful for someone who doesn't have a financial background like me. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I wished the quizzes were a little more tricky that would help test my understanding of the materials. Overall, pretty good, thanks Coursera and Prof. Estrada for the course!!",4
15832,Learned a lot throughout the course. Easy to understand lectures and good supplemental materials that makes this course an enjoyable one.,4
15835,"Thank you for making me understand the very basics of finance, OMG. Although I prefer Islamic finance (without interest), I wanted to understand how western finance works. The videos are short, to the point, and I would advice anyone to be committed. I like how Coursera sends you emails to remind you, encourage you and motivate you to complete the course. Much respect for the work you put into the technical notes, and for making the concepts as easy to understand as possible! I am so grateful for this course, it helps a lot with my Managerial Finance class!! :)",4
15843,Thoroughly enjoying prof. Estrada's course. he Witty Prof. vs Student notes is a very good read.,4
15847,Excellent course that really teaches or reviews the basics. The only reason I am giving it four stars (which could be unfair) is that I cannot give it 4.5. The only reason I believe this course deserves a 4.5 is the lack of problem sets or changing exams. I'd love to really master the concepts with different figures and situations. This course is still definitely worth your time and effort and is a great introduction or revision.,4
15854,"This was a very good course for a down and dirty review of WACC, NPV, IRR, EVA, etc. The instructor covers the material well and I found that the reading material was a very good compliment to the lectures and helped embed the material for use in the assignments. I recommend this course for those looking for a review or an introduction to Corporate Finance.",4
15859,It's good course.,4
15864,"I like the course which is easy to understand.From my point of view, it's both academic and practical.Thanks for providing such great course.Thanks Prof.",4
15868,"As the name implies, this course covers the very essential materials of corporate finance. And it focuses on the interpretation and application of WACC. The whole course is a preliminary for Corporate Finance.",4
15871,"It is a very good course. It explained very clear the fundamentals and principles of finance.Also is free if you do not need a certificate.It does not have very deep explanation of the formulas, so it is only good for people who only want to know and understand the principles.",4
15875,"It was fun. But I think that would be great to add more various tasks and do something with the quality of the video, because sometimes it was hard to concentrate on the content.Nevertheless, it is good start to develop your creativity and open some useful tools for yourself.",4
15876,"This is a fun and engaging class. I was challenged by the assignments on so many levels while taking this class. They have encouraged me to try new things even if it seems ridiculous to others. I especially liked the feedback, the constructive critiques all helped me through this course.",4
15883,"It was a life changing course for me. Although I didn't attempt the certificate or the assignments, yet it has helped me a lot to take a whole new approach in my business.",4
15887,"There is some good content on creativity in this course, thoug it barely addresses problem solving.""Do something different"" assingments were an interesting idea.Some content material is missing, including the link to a text that is needed to answer a quizz which will influence your final grade.Grading standards are weird: maximum grades are to be given to assignments performed in public, as if things done in private aren't creative; there are better ways to have someone get out of their comfort zone. Assingments request that you be photographed or filmed, and there is no disclaimer that your photos or your privacy will be protected. If you are an introvert or simply a person who values privacy, this is not the course for you.",4
15891,"I enjoyed this course a lot, it makes you expand your horizons and challenge yourself in order to be more creative, i liked going through the different assignments and forcing myself to think outside the box; however i wish there had been more material and emphasis in actual problem solving which was the reason why i wanted to take the course in first place.",4
15895,"This type of course I was looking for, which is fulfilled. It will help to explore and polish my creative abilities. Thank you for providing it.",4
15896,"Such a great MOOC, I really enjoyed it a lot!! My life is not the same after it anymore.",4
15897,Very intelligent approach of incentivating the creativity. Maybe the videos shall give even more activities to do. But it is a very interesting course.,4
15902,"This course is an easy, entertaining, and beneficial course. It is encourages you to enhance your creativity in everyday lives. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would've preferred to include more theoretical knowledge in addition to the practical.",4
15904,"Presentation is a little dull, bit the content is really good!",4
15911,As previous courses in this specialisation it gives an opportunity to see all critical human's problems in the 21st century from totally different perspective. Thx!,4
15924,"The class was wonderfully informative, but would have been better if it offered graded tests without the paid version. Since the answers are multiple choice I thought it was strange that it did not.",4
15947,"Lecturer is interesting, and manages to carry students along",4
15949,"Excellent subject matter, teacher very fun to listen to and very knowledgeable. Would like the class to be more in-depth.",4
15956,This course was good. It was great to refresh knowledge.,4
15958,"Very good course, especially for the (new) pet owner!",4
15964,"This course really helps you look at creativity in a different way, it is very empowering but for this course to be successful you must apply what you have learned everyday, its practice otherwise the teachings will not be complete.",4
15969,"It was a very interesting course. It has benefited me to stimulate my creative juices. Would really love to continue its next module if any.Thank you all the Facilitators for your support,help and guidance.",4
15978,wonderful and informative course,4
15979,"I think this course is full of fun. It taught me many techniques for creating things. I think in my future life, it can help me a lot.",4
15984,amazing ideas in a simple way,4
15985,"Creativity, Innovation and Change is a refreshing taking on using creativity to solve problems. It employs the use of structured but unique approaches to solve problems in an individual or team setting.",4
15991,thanks for a,4
16000,This really gets you out of your box.,4
16019,"Excellent course, but very introductory.",4
16024,"I like the balance between learning the principles involved in creating effective visualizations and practicing them while learning to use Tableau. I was happy with the visualization I created for my final assignment. It would NOT have been as good had I not taken this course and learned to make use of pre Gestalt principles, attentive attributes and decluttering techniques to reduce the cognitive load involved in viewing my visualization.",4
16026,This course is really informative and provides new learning to me. It is just what i need in my career path right now. Kudos to the developer of this course and for making it available on the internet platform,4
16030,Excellent course. Very help full to understand the visualization basic by using Tableau.,4
16031,"The course covers all of the relevant parts, however it does not go deep enough. It is highly recommended for complete beginners, but not for those who already have some knowledge in the field.In particular, more content should have been provided for the following topics:(1) Data connections, e.g. include a real example for connecting to odata and web data connector, also create a sheet with the data;(2) The context of data visualisation (who, what, how, big idea), e.g. walk though two additional examples in different fields.I particularly appreciated:(i) The historical introduction (and I would have liked to read more about this)(ii) Live Connection vs Tableau Data Extract(iii) How to prepare an Excel sheet for import(iv) The strategy for making a story (but as I said, this is partial)",4
16035,"Although a very basic introduction to the use of Tableau, the course provides a broad and interesting background that should prove useful to anyone seeking to enhance their understanding of visualization fundamentals.",4
16038,The material was very well laid out. I learned a lot about the basics of tableau. The resources and references were very helpful!,4
16050,Clear and straightforward. Good introduction.,4
16055,"The course is great. Would have been even better if there were questions posed and answers given during the videos for Tableau case studies. Overall, an informative course! Thanks.",4
16057,Course was OK - the material on Tableau though was very light.,4
16062,Good course! the submit assignments weren't always celar unfortunately.,4
16064,"The Course was well suited for beginners and explained pretty useful concepts, but I think materials of week 3 need to be polished more.",4
16070,Good beginning and good course,4
16076,Great examples and perfect for learning the basics.,4
16077,Valuable introductory course on Tableau. Also lays the foundation for by providing good reference material on Statistics and as well on the communication/presentation of ideas,4
16079,Some off the instructions for the assignments were either incomplete or misleading. Uploading instructions were also unclear.,4
16080,"introduces the fundamentals of Tableau and gave examples of story board, explored basic functions of Tableau, a good introduction course to Tableau.",4
16088,"Great material however discussion forums is dead (despite hundreds of views), mentors are unresponsive to questions",4
16100,"Very good!I think week 4 was very time consuming, in contrast with week 3, that was very light. Maybe these contents can be better balanced in the fuute.",4
16104,"Great content.Need more exercises, and solution to homeworks (eventually).",4
16107,"Sadly, I was unable to comprehend everything I had seen. :(",4
16109,"A pretty dry topic, but the teacher manages to keep the interest up!",4
16111,"PDF slides would have been appreciated. The course is good, contents are good.",4
16114,"Interesting course, the math was certainly complex. I would have liked to know a little more on how the equation itself worked.Also more hands on work is also nice and paints a more clear picture.Thanks",4
16118,"Pretty nice course, on par with the more popular Coursera course Cryptography I by Dan Boneh - more of an introductory course for applied cryptography while Cryptography I is somewhat more theoretical. Useful introduction to DH and RSA. Purely optional programming assignments - .",4
16121,"Good course, but can get very deep at times, especially near the middle of the course.The first 2 weeks are rather simple, week 3 is okay, 4 and 5 are very detailed, and 6 and 7 are easier.",4
16125,Could have given a certificate of accomplishment.,4
16126,Course provides practical understanding for cryptographic primitives without delving too deeply into the maths. I found the accompanying book (optional) to be of great value in enhancing the depth of material. Would have been helpful to spend a bit more time on SSL/TLS to solidify the knowledge.,4
16131,Complicated course that requires lots of mathematic background,4
16132,Awesome course those who wants to learn more thing about cryptography should go for it.I really appreciate work done by Prof. Jonathan Katz.Thanks Jonathan Katz for sharing your valuable knowledge.,4
16134,"I needed an introduction course for cryptography.finding coursera was amazing, registering and participating in this course was just what I was looking for.Explanations and examples are clear and understood.Keeping the pace for 7 weeks was a straggle worth paying !!Thanks for the effort invested to bring it public, will surly participate in more classes.",4
16135,"Nice course! The private-key schemes part was especially well structured. I would consider plus one or two weeks to have more time for public-key part too. This way the practical implications of public key cryptography, like the lecture on SSL, could be more detailed as well.",4
16138,"This course was enjoyable and challenging. Early lessons cover historical ciphers, along with some fun programming challenges to attack them.Later lessons dive into modern cryptography. This is more challenging and you will need to study some number theory if you have not done so previously. I ended up buying Prof Katz' book and also Concrete Mathematics to fully get my head around the subject matter. The treatment is not superficial.This is where I dropped one star from the review - I thought that the course could have done a better job of covering the theory in this space, or at least pointing to sources to study it, or mentioning it as a pre-requisite.I also thought that the course could have done a better job of describing how all the pieces come together - the discussion is there, but it is light and somewhat assumed you will get it. The only thorough discussion is specifically for SSL / TLS late in the lecture series.Overall, a good and challenging course. This is not an easy MOOC - so only take it if you are interested in a challenge and don't mind extra study time.",4
16141,Very much helpful for learning Cryptography,4
16145,"There are too much materials for each week for a Hong Kong secondary school (middle school) student. The speed can be adjusted to a slower one, so as to allow more people to catch up the course.",4
16150,Funny workshops.,4
16155,"A good global/general overview of oppertunities and threads irt new emerging powers and states!For me, as European, it may had more focus on CSTO instead of NATO (we generally know enough about this organizations, and information about CSTO is more difficult to get (in English/German/French/Dutch)After all a very good course, i'm looking forward to see a followup comming ;-)",4
16161,Great!,4
16164,One of my favorite,4
16165,"Really good course, great materials and well structured",4
16171,"A great course for anyone preparing for a job interview! Not only it shows you what you should know, but it also helps you sharpen the skills you already have and points you in the right direction towards career success..",4
16178,"Very useful information for interviews, especially if you're not familiar with the process used for interviewing software development candidates.",4
16181,This course is really helpful and useful with great contents and tips !,4
16196,"Nice course. Should be taken once you are done with the Computer Science basic courses like data structures, algorithms, etc.",4
16198,Very useful for job finding.,4
16201,best to have to get an approach for a technical interview.,4
16203,"Well crafted, but the number of questions could have been more.",4
16218,Useful and interesting,4
16221,Really enjoying the courses so far. Learning so much from what I already know from past studies and work experience.,4
16222,This course was excellent and I completed it feeling that what I have learnt is truly of value and relevant to this industry.,4
16232,Spanish grammar is learned by indirect way.,4
16237,"i personaly feel its too general, on the surface. i would rther know more on fewer sociologist.",4
16251,"The course was great, though the final exam was a little too much.",4
16268,The professor discusses with ease every assignment that you'll completely understand from the most basic theory to the very complex ones.,4
16270,I really enjoyed this course. I am completely new to the social sciences and I learned a lot. The instructor is a great teacher who explains ideas carefully. His enthusiasm for the subject is infectious and inspiring. The optional answers for the quiz questions are sometimes very close. It was challenging to pass the quizzes. I look forward to the next instalment: Modern Sociological Theory.,4
16275,I'd highly recommend this as an introduction to Sociology. Particularly beneficial for those with no previous experience of the subject.,4
16276,"An interesting introduction to sociology given by an enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Why, I even now have a Norbert Elias book on my Amazon wishlist :)",4
16280,"It's a course very completed and it give you a good sight of the classical theories, entering you to the social thinking.",4
16291,Interesting course :),4
16296,The content of this course is very good to cover some greatest thinkers in human history. It is important to know them and their thoughts to understand the society and oneself. One thing could be improved is the exercises. They're repeative and fail to inspire me.,4
16310,"A great lectures, I really like the attitude of this professor. He is really into his subject and I appreciated his resolution, when it comes to reducing the legacy of his favorite sociologists, into just one crucial point.Not five stars for quizzes, the parts concerning reading of classics could be much more motivating, in the aspect of the actual reading and anderstanding.Wish the course from University of Amsterdam on modern authors to come sooner.",4
16315,"Very good intro. Being a Engineer with a couple courses of humanties, this was a solid base for further reading. Pay attention to the readings!",4
16316,A great insight on the classical sociologists,4
16343,"Great lectures with clear explanations and illustrations. Well chosen readings. Extremely interesting topics. Some of the quiz questions were ambiguous, particularly ones that asked students to pick the quotes that best represent a particular idea.",4
16356,Interesting insight in my favorite subject. A bit simple compared with my college classes,4
16361,Great profesor,4
16364,"Thank you very much for creating this course. Basic concepts of Population, Sample, Sampling distribution, Sampling distribution variability, Hypothesis testing and ANOVA was really very helpful. the course is designed in a very nice way and the questions in between are of good standard.",4
16367,This was good module. It covers the basics of inferential statistical techniques along with its application using SAS/Python. I would definitely recommend to take up if you are a beginner.,4
16372,Enjoyable and easy to follow along with. good videos and examples. Helped fill in some gaps.,4
16377,This course is very good especially for beginners getting started with SAS or python for data analytics. The lessons are very clear and easy to understand. Learnt a lot of valuable information and also enjoyed it.,4
16378,"Very clear description of basic statistics without all the jargons and mathematical formulas behind it. Unfortunately, somehow, such a good course lacks students and the discussion forum is like ghost room with virtually zero interaction.",4
16379,"Very informative. Tedious concepts like ANOVA, Chi square test etc taught in very simple and effective manner.There're two options for analysis, SAS and Phython. I'd recommend readers to read more on PROC ANOVA for better understanding.",4
16382,Videos are good and to the point.Animation is very user friendly.,4
16383,Very good from a conceptual point of view.,4
16389,"It is a good course for a complete beginner in statistical inference. It helped me to understand some points I found confusing in ""Statistical Inference"" Coursera course.",4
16390,"It's one of the best course for understanding all the statistical tools , used for data sciences. Thanks to entire team for making such a wonderful course content",4
16392,"Lectures are well realized (animation, change in contexts) and peer review process.",4
16394,"The instructors are pleasant, and the videos helpful. Unlike some classes where it feels like there is gulf between the toy examples covered in the lectures and what's requested in the assignments, the materials available speak directly to the homework.The virtually non-existent discussion board, lacking much activity from either students or staff, is a real downer.",4
16395,This course is very interesting and every data scientist should take time and digest it.,4
16406,I learn so much about forecasting with assignments ! Thx u Coursera :),4
16411,Felt a lot less like a commercial than those videos of the previous session.These presenters are much more conscious of how many hand gestures they use.Thanks.,4
16418,Great intro to a complex topic.It could be improved by having the programming assignments be:+ Mandatory+ More related to actual cryptographic algorithms/libraries (only some are),4
16420,The Course has been more about knowing about and implementing them and has been more helpfull in doing so.,4
16428,Very interesting but sometimes too detailed. Courses often needs good knowledge in mathematics althought there are some reviews.,4
16442,Lots of knowledge and an engaging course.,4
16463,I liked it! Hard but worth it.,4
16473,"The course is really what I wanted: It covers theoretical and practical aspect of cryptography. The exercises are also very well designed, although, I found some of them quite difficult.Overall, I would recommend this course to a friend.",4
16479,"Very thorough, lot's of math. A bit too academic for my taste, it's not really useful in practice.",4
16496,Fantastic course that gives the basic notions of cryptography. Both practical a theoretical tests are very useful.,4
16504,Quite good course to increase your cryptography skills...,4
16510,Wonderful course and the teacher is very well prepared.,4
16514,This is a tough course.but teaching is very good.,4
16532,"Great course, but a bit disappointed by the fact that I'll have to do it all over again to get a certificate.",4
16535,"pretty good, well explained and clear",4
16538,Very good course with a level accessible without the need to be a mathematical guru. Maybe some videos are a little beat too long.,4
16540,"Very good course, clear lecture.",4
16561,I liked the level commitment the programming problems demanded. It truly made you feel you had a deeper understanding of the subject after finishing them as opposed to just reading and answering multiple choice questions. Thanks for putting this together for the world to learn!,4
16565,Would be better if this course includes guidelines and policies of cyber security,4
16573,Very effective!,4
16575,"Good course for general knowledge of the subject. I felt the amount of reading, especially the 4th week, should be more accurately represented. At least for time management.",4
16579,A wonderful course delivered in a lucid and easy to understand format. I like the discussions much. Thanks.,4
16580,"A very informative course in the sense that though its very basic but its the first time I got everything in a structured way. I am already a Infosec professional however my domain is not mobility. So mobility with security and its use business development is a phenomenal task. Hence, I guess its a very good course for this specialisation. I am not giving 5 stars as there is always scope for improvement. However, it may be taken as a five star course.Thanks to all the people who designed the course.",4
16581,I wish there was a little more meat.,4
16582,Great class; interesting reading assignments,4
16592,It is a really great course! I learnt a lot!,4
16612,"Very well structured course, with very nice contents. Needs revision for a lot of easy spottable errors, better lecture slides and better explanations. The last module also needs a complete revision because it has errors and it is really not well explained (beside the subject is relatively simple).",4
16615,Great Course and Instructors!Only think i didn't like is the peer grading system as many of the users grade low without any reason!,4
16617,best course for a database beginner.,4
16620,Comprehensive and good pacing for content.,4
16637,The course was very helpful,4
16639,Provides an excellent coverage of the essentials of Databases.,4
16644,good learning,4
16648,"Great course, learned a fair deal in regards to DB from a beginners POV. The only thing that left a sour taste in my mouth is the poor attitude of some students towards each other. The course uses peer-reviews and sadly some students take joy in poorly grading others whilst providing feedback along the lines of 'Great work!'.If there was the possibility to actually report these users instead of having to resubmit your work and pray the next set of peers have some decency, I'd happily change my review to a 5 star.",4
16649,"Course moves very quickly, but material covered was good. Some complaints that the peer-graded assignments need an appeal process.",4
16652,Course really introduced me to the basic concepts that I need in database design. I really appreciate.,4
16653,Great Course,4
16656,Its good,4
16657,"No programming demonstrations, but this is a very good introduction! thx!",4
16668,Very good but more examples missing,4
16680,"Excellent course, with good video lectures. However, the written course materials, especially in terms of slides and assignment instructions, suffer from poor grammar and an occasional lack of clarity.",4
16681,"Good Course with good learning, but at some places it becomes extremely boring which drifts away the excitement and commitment towards the course.",4
16687,it is really good course. but the lecturer should speak slower and more focus on the important issues.Thanks overall is a good course.,4
16688,Thanks for a great course,4
16689,"Good course for broad end-to-end discussion of database design and management. Lectures are decent, assignments and practice problems are pretty helpful. Class takes 3-4 hours/week on average, though it varies by week. Would have like to see more advanced discussion for some of the easier topics/shorter weeks.",4
16694,"This is a very good course that teaches you many important skills in preparation for the next courses. It does start off with the basics of SQL DDL and DML that most professionals may already know, but later modules that cover design concepts and practice are very good. There are a few errors in the videos but these are easy to spot.",4
16695,Perfect for a DB beginner ! It has all the basic standards taught to follow when working with basic commands in DB.,4
16698,Step by step explanations. Divided into small parts so that the students can digest the information in small pieces. I like it so far.,4
16705,"Some terminologies are confusing, like BCNF, more in-lecture examples are appriciated.",4
16706,"I really enjoyed this course, the course instructor has a nice tonality and the presentation are most of the time well structured. The database installation should be covered in more detail and i had to buy the book in order to understand everything. Over",4
16720,"Short videos, but good Practice problems and Assignments.",4
16722,Great Course. Awesome Content. The sessions can be a little more interactive.,4
16723,"A good entry into database thinking. Homework is a tad on the high side for people who just want to learn on the side. Also, not clear why diagrams can't be automated directly from the database programs e.g. Access. Why would I draw an ERD and then design a database separately - better just design the tables and the diagram directly; then you have your ERD from the program e.g. Access or Filemaker.",4
16724,good course,4
16728,Good but with some errors in assignments and not real support via the forum - some question has not been answered,4
16731,"Nice course, but very little has been said about the performance of the databases.",4
16733,Great course,4
16739,Fair enough. Good material and content for someone new or that needs to remember basic concepts about databases. Not needed if the main focus is DWH and experience with DB exists,4
16741,"This is a very, very good course about databases fundamentals and design.",4
16742,"Very useful information, and the explanation is really easy to understand",4
16745,"Although not have any business intelligence content, I recommend it to people who need to strengthen their knowledge in databases. On the other hand, it should be an optional course for those who were interested in obtaining certification.",4
16748,"The lecture videos have a format that is a bit over structured. It feels like the instructor takes as much time asking and answering an often contrived ""motivation"" question as he does teaching relevant material. The slides are of sufficient quality however to make viewing the lectures optional. .I would have appreciated having all the courses documents in single zip file.",4
16751,The way of grading is unfair sometimes.,4
16752,A very well planned and prepared course.,4
16755,"The course was very well presented and was easy to follow. my only problem is that I struggled a little and as much as I was trying to follow and read the recommended reading material, I found that there was not enough time due to the volume of assignments per week. Maybe if the assignments were reduced or we have them every 2 weeks?!",4
16764,"Very nice introduction to databases. The lectures are not very engaging, the plus is there are practical assignments for every week, where you learn the most. First you submit your own solution and then you provide feedback to your peers. I like the format of the assignments.",4
16767,The course is well structured with clear objective for each lecture. It starts by asking the main question about the course then summarize the answer and the key messages.Practice and assignment are valuable to apply and test courses knowledge.Thank you,4
16773,"It was a very nice course, however, there was less focus on SQL and more focus on ERDs",4
16774,Great course! My suggestion is to correct a few errors in the proposed solutions. Thank you very much to all the persons that make this courses possible. I enjoyed it very much and I will continue to finish the full track.,4
16775,many mistakes in files,4
16777,"if you dont have knowledge of database at all, then its little hard to understand concepts.but the videos are insightful and helpful..we need to work more and more.Normalisation is little difficult to understand here...my personal comment",4
16783,Great course! Thank you!,4
16784,Interesting and Informative,4
16785,The teacher's lecture is not very clear and all the assignments are graded by peer classmates which may occur several controversial issues.,4
16786,"Very comprehensive course on introduction to database. This is an advanced course so you should have some experience with DBs before taking it. The lecturer, Mr. Mannino, delivers a dry, straightforward teaching style. There are plenty of materials but unfortunately, there is little interaction in the forums from the teacher himself.",4
16787,"A solid course, I feel well versed in the fundamentals of database design. The 'opening question' bits are rather superfluous though.",4
16788,The course has good material and solid assignment. It would be five star if it goes more deep in some topics,4
16793,"To be an introduction, it is a good course.",4
16794,nice course. however would have liked more specific examples of cyber conflicts along with how they were resolved to each country's satisfaction ( if there are any such examples to look at ). Thank you to you all for putting this course together.,4
16802,It gives you an interesting visions about hot subjects and provides with sources to go deeper. Maybe a course to short on each topic covered.,4
16803,"Pretty good course. While the assessments are pretty much just a repeat of the in-video questions, I feel I was still able to learn a fair amount.",4
16811,"Nice blend of psychology, game theory, international relations and cyberwarfare, enriched with all kind of examples from the nuclear arms race.",4
16813,Interesting,4
16816,"It takes time for me, as a non English spoken, to understand some professor's accent. Overall, I learned a lot from this course. This course helped me understand what causes of cyberattack are, the wa",4
16819,general view on the subject. some interesting ideas.,4
16822,Good course ... good introduction to the topic.,4
16824,Superb course. Gave me a lot of insights.,4
16825,"Course in not only just about theory of cyber security .But also ,It also accommodates psychological view to cyber world . This makes it more interesting .The brief part of law related to cyber security buttress the content maturity .However, More information on privacy should be added .If done ,course is a 5 star Course .Moreover, every lecture gives information.So, efficiently crafted out of course .Overall,it's worth taking and worth time spending",4
16829,"Parts are thin on detail. This is a good and broad overview but lacks in-depth information of use to cyber security specialists. Still, a good course to start with if you plan to move forward.",4
16830,"The topic of the course is very interesting, the readings were important, but some of the reading were based on a book, that I had to purchase. Was a very useful course, but was a little bit tiring, videos with 12 minutes with too much theory but less pratical examples. But was a good experience. I would like to thanks the professors, that made this course.",4
16831,Good for an international perspective on Cyber Conflicts. Covers a wide range of topics,4
16833,The course content was great but delivery was a little dry. Appears that the presenters were reading from a teleprompter - sort of awkward.,4
16834,This course was very informative and helped me understand about International Cyber Conflicts. Ahmad.,4
16837,"Course was ok. However, some of questions were not clear based on excerpt from support video. For example, quiz #1 question 7. Course was ""general"" overview of very important subject matter of Cyber Conflicts. Looking forward to a more specific and detailed course structure. PS: A course concerning Cyberwar in Space would be quite interesting.",4
16841,+ Excellent introduction and overview. Recommend!-Some of the readings were not available on the internet,4
16842,"Having no experience in cyber security, this course is helping me understand the basics of cyber security so that I may advance in Cyber forensics. I highly recommend it.",4
16843,"This course is very interesting and actualized.My unique problem is about the certificate, I need information about the quantity of hours duration.",4
16844,Great information on cyber conflicts and the psychology of cyber conflict and warfare.,4
16846,"This was a very good course (4.5/5.0). One area that could be improved would be the discussion of industrial control systems (ICS). On lecture briefly mentions STUXNET and SCADA, but this was rather incomplete discussion. A very recent incident that could have been used was the attack on the Ukraine Power grid as a demo of a cyber attack against infrastructure. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01?_mc=sm_dr_editor_kellyjacksonhigginsI am perhaps biased toward this area, since this is my field of work.",4
16848,awesome course I learned a great,4
16851,Good course,4
16860,Tough course to get through and very different to the others in the specialisation but knowing about statistics has given me a different view of the world and I have really gained something from doing it. I can hold reasonable conversations with data analysts and the like now.,4
16862,"I think this course missed an opportunity to teach ways to run real life experiments in abstract of R-Studio. Instead, this was an R-Studio course in running experiments in abstract of what or why you would want to even approach these types of experiments. It didn't fit the specialization IMHO, but I did find it valuable as someone who is re-approaching and deepening my existing skillset.",4
16865,Some times i felt lack of explanation. Because there is a lot of math. And quizzes are too big (10 + 32 questions on Week 7). But overall i would say that this course is the only one to which i will definetly come back,4
16878,"Designing experiments wasn't what I thought, and had a very steep learning curve.",4
16884,"Great course! It was difficult, but mostly due to my lack of basic knowledge about statistics. A primer lesson would have been great. But with some research on some topics on my own I could complete the course with a sufficient understanding of the concepts.I found the lectures and assignments to be very clear and concise. Props for the professor ;)",4
16887,It looks great,4
16895,The instructor for this course was great. He was very responsive to students' questions concerns.,4
16902,"This course was put together with lots of thought and care, and I appreciated the thoroughness of the files and assignments. The content was quite dry, and I'm not totally confident in my abilities to execute the tests in real life.",4
16903,"I found this course hard, but very rewarding. R is a tool which I see more and more frequently on job postings so I'm grateful for having had an introduction into the syntax and the tool. My only issue with the course was that, as this wasn't a programming course and was just an introduction into the tool, I had no way of troubleshooting problems when I had error messages or my answers were incorrect. I struggled to know how to fix my test answers when they were wrong and had to re-do most of the analyses until I got different answers.That being said, the course materials were excellent and have provided a brilliant grounding into the tool which I'm sure to use into the future.",4
16905,"This is a really well-run course. The lecturer explains complex topics in a very simple way and is obviously very passionate about his subject. He is also far more engaged in discussions than any other lecturer. Unfortunately tis a total mismatch in the Interaction Design specialisation. We need to know what results mean and how to use them, we don't need to be able to calculate them to this level of detail ourselves. This should be pitched at a much much higher level for it to be a useful part of the specialisation.",4
16918,Thank you for designing a course that demonstrates that UX is not just painting!,4
16923,Informative,4
16940,The course is nice but the wording of the course is heavy and is confusing most of the time.You've to put a lot of effort in trying to understand what the instructor means or want to say/ask.,4
16942,"This course was good and the professor did a good job explaining content, however, it didn't really seem like useful information to me since it was extremely theoretical.",4
16947,It was a very informative course - I definitely will apply with I leant in my every day management,4
16950,I like the course. It's answer my questions about organization design which was a mystery for me!!,4
16954,Great cou,4
16956,Great course. This course cleared up the confusion i previously experienced concerning the concepts. I will keep recommending the course to friends.,4
16957,"Content wise and pedagogically I found this course extremely valuable. It gives you a nuanced insight into 'federalism' and 'decentralisation'. Particularly valuable are 1. The conscious incorporation of a multi-disciplinary perspective that shows that the actual practice of these political architectures are by no means shaped primarily by their institutional design, but heavily influenced by historical, political, social, economic and cultural factors. 2. The extensive references to the three major cases in Africa, particularly through the reading. Very interesting articles also that draw attention to in-country variations and how recentralisation may occur within federal and decentralised systems. Pedagogically the course is also well set up. Jan Erks is an excellent presenter whose tone of voice, articulation and body language make for effective communication. What on the surface seems to be periodic 'repetition' of key points, in fact is intentionally designed so as to get key messages reinforced. There were only three weaknesses in the course when I did it: 1. The English transcripts should have been checked. They may have been done by volunteers whose input is admirable, but often there are grammatical errors or it was obvious that the transcriber didn't understand/capture what Jan Erks was saying. 2. Four out of the readings, which like the others should have been accessible, actually were not - only if you paid for them, which is not what it should have been. 3. This course now seems to be running on automatic pilot: there was no indication whatsoever that there was anyone making up a support person or support team who was monitoring the discussion forum, where the problem of the inaccessible readings was flagged up in week 2 already. So it wasn't rectified by the end of the course. That is not serious, certainly not for a university with a reputation as that of Leiden. Some attention please, and rapid corrective action!",4
16962,great work its about time we paid attention to this great ontininenti,4
16963,"Great course and very well explained.I have decided not to click the maximum puntuation because the course focused on Africa less than I expected. It focuses much more on Federalism and Decentralization, which is good. However, I missed more info about Africa.Congrats for the interesting course!",4
16964,"This has been the most interesting course for me so far on coursera (I have done about 9 so far). The lecturer and the topic were both interesting and presented in a lively and accurate manner especially concerning Africa. No assumptions or stereotypes on the continent or topic were made and I learned a lot.There ain't many courses here on Africa and this was was so engaging I completed a 7 week course in 1 week, that's how much I actually enjoyed it. The course material is deep and confusing thus a lot of focus is need and this was a course I actually wasn't able to multi-task on because it requires much of a person's attention.",4
16968,"Great course, with really good information. Instructor is excellent.",4
16969,"Great course, however some points could be improved because sometimes it seemed just a repetition from the theory one.",4
16974,"Excellent Course, but is not for beginners.Excellent Professor too.",4
16977,Great use of information that can be put to use immediately!!,4
16981,It was good,4
16987,"If we can learn by a specific case study to utilize these tools, that would be more practical",4
16988,Very nice content! Some more hands-on exercises would be very helpful.,4
16991,"The course content is very valuable to any digital marketing practitioner, but the reason I am rating it as 4/5 is that there was basically no ""In practice"" part. All assignments were along the lines of ""discuss this,"" which might be OK to make us think, but analytics is so much about doing I missed having a chunk of data thrown at me to see what I can find.",4
16992,It is a good course,4
16993,Excellent course for Marketing professionals as well as for novices,4
16994,All courses have their benefits. this one had fewer benefits than the second course in this series but still a good one to go about,4
17001,"This course was more specific and actionable than the theory course. It fulfills it's mission well. The readings are excellent. I printed several to use for my own blog and content marketing efforts.Though competent, the instructor is lackluster, frequently just reading from the slides. The substance is good but the style is dry.",4
17011,"Great, though some parts felt like the lecturer was reading off the slides.",4
17015,"Very good course. Interesting content, great suggested readings, well explained lectures. I have no previous knowledge about the subject and I have learnt a lot about Marketing Analytics in both course Marketing Analytics in Theory and In Practice.",4
17021,I stongly recommend this course if you are working in a marketing department. The only reason I give 4 stars is because I would like more recent extra material. Instructor Kevin Hartman is great and clearly passionate about his job.,4
17022,Overall it was a good course but the only thing I would recommend is relating with the assignments. What I saw in almost all the assignments we should have had experience on the work to do them. But since not everybody has that experience it would be nice to think even for beginners as well.,4
17023,"Great course with useful tips and organized materials. However, some of the materials (recommended tools, hyperlinks, etc) are outdated so it would be great if they can refresh them. Also, the in-course quizzes are too easy to the point it seemed quite stupid - please include more meaningful questions in the in-video quizzes.",4
17024,"Good, however the instructor videos could be better in content.",4
17025,Great Module. Enjoyed thoroughly.,4
17031,Great!,4
17032,I liked the 5 highlights per lesson - it helped recap the most important content.,4
17037,It's great to learn from someone so high up in the industry and knowledgeable in this field.,4
17044,"I preferred the third course that emphasized practical application in the specialization over the second course that was mostly theory. The assignments were geared to engage your insights / ideas about what you know and/or are learning about real-life projects. Although it still only scratches the surface, I liked the ability to apply some of the assignments to a company with which I've been working.",4
17048,"If you want to understand the context, use and possible tools to manage digital marketing understanding the importance of data in this process, this is the course you should apply for.",4
17054,I love it!,4
17064,"Good course that provide basics. However, I wish it gave a chance to practice the gained knowledge!",4
17070,Great. Thank you.,4
17071,"Good course overall. I gave it only four stars because I expected it to be more practical and more hands-on analysis to do for assignments, instead of just discussing things.",4
17078,Great course. One drawback: exercises are not oriented towards actions,4
17079,I think this module should have included a bit more stories just like the first module of this specialization to make it more compelling and engaging.,4
17081,This course is acceptable for basic practices. Highly recommended for those who want to take first dip into the Marketing Analytics world.,4
17083,Interesting course with great insights on web analytics. It will be good if there were some assignments where we could execute some analytics concepts,4
17086,"Very interesting course with clean slides and good understanding of the key concepts. A bit more ""practice"" would have been better, but I still highly recommend this course for a basic knowledge in digital marketing.",4
17087,"To put more context here, I think you can expand a little more what are you teaching; especially in the data analysis part.",4
17089,Module 1 is good. will see and rate later,4
17093,It is quite basic but gives a nice overview of the subject.,4
17095,"Simple, Practical and Crisp.",4
17098,"It would be helpful if the reading materials had recommended chapters from the textbook that we were asked to download. While it it helpful to have the text book the course is entirely passable without the use of the text, what I caused for me is heavy reliance on the videos and recommended reading material because it consumed less time but then I still feel that there is a bit more I could have learnt. So I suggest using chapters from the recommended text book as well to broaden the knowledge of students who are quite new to Digital Analytics like myself.",4
17104,"Since this course is about practice, more impetus should be given on practising the concepts. The concepts should have been taught in 'Marketing Analytics in Theory' course.",4
17107,Great course. Like the slides and the way it structured. It could be broader if not so Google centralized and more international. For example in Russia there is Yandex.ru (ya.com) which controls 75% of search market and in China there is Baidu and others and no Google and Facebook. These questions is not highlighted in the course.,4
17110,It was an interesting overview and a good in-depth method of managing a digital marketing project. I wish there would have been more statistical insight and data analysis exercice.,4
17112,Great introductory course for those looking to familiarize themselves with the overall thought process behind analytics and visualization.,4
17113,"Good intro to implement marketing analytics principal, especially lecture 5 onward.",4
17114,Awesome course,4
17115,"Basic, but good knowledge",4
17120,had a good learning experience,4
17124,An interesting problem to tackle. I really liked that you started with very raw data and needed to work on many cleaning methods. Good practice for real data science.,4
17130,I like that it took the knowledge I'd acquired over 20 years of working in the technology field and applied it to the new organized business analysis field that has become the norm.,4
17133,It's a excellent course about writing requirements from clients' stories. I just wish I dad seen more techniques about linking business requirements (high level requirements ) to software engineering requirements (low level requirements) and its management.,4
17135,"The course is ok, but it is discouraging for non-English speakers.",4
17136,"To depended on peer graded tasks, when all course is done an you are still waiting for others to rate you. This is really annoying part.",4
17160,A good course to revise the concepts of capturing software requirements learned during a software engineering bachelors and to gather some of the newer techniques used in the industry such as use of user stories.,4
17161,"Great overview of the subject, appropriate homework assignments to understand de value of the concepts we ar talking about",4
17163,This course is very great. With this course I know what to do to be system analyst,4
17166,"Simple to follow overview of useful concepts, helpful reference documents for further reading.",4
17170,I liked the course.,4
17174,"Thank you very much for the course - it was really interesting and I've found some useful techniques to be used in my work. However, there are some moments to be improved to make course better: correct questions statements and lack of communication between partipants (there were a lot of interesting topics to discuss but only very few users were involved in discussions, thus, discussion were very poor).But still thank you very much again!!!:))",4
17182,Great courses...,4
17184,Very modular and detailed step by step explanations. Easy to follow.,4
17185,"Interesting but would gain by digging more on each topic. And give more feedback from the real life. The worst part, for me, was one assignment (ambiguities) that I thought was neither well designed nor easy to peer review (due to its desing ;-). Then again the course was nice to follow and interesting!",4
17193,Everything was good but I think they have to re think about the ambiguous requirements module,4
17195,great course,4
17199,"It is pretty solid. I can see that issues with quiz question ambiguity and under-checking of learning criteria are getting better. Problems were not serious, they are better in this course than in the last, and they are better in the next one, and they are better in the next one than this one.",4
17203,Really good course for studying basics of software requirements domain.,4
17232,Good for new people in the area. All the basics well covered.,4
17233,"Good material, easy to learn",4
17235,I really like tasks and quizzes in the course. It makes in much more transparent. Thanks!,4
17237,Amazing course introducing real and workable concepts. I will be applying this to my workflow immediately.Only downfalls being a little ambiguity in some questions and some `multiple choice` questions only allow one answer (radio buttons).Thank you!,4
17240,Good course with an excellent assignment.Just if more details are supplied then the course be more valuable.,4
17243,Great production values and useful techniques and assignments for eliciting and expressing client needs.,4
17256,That's interesting course - a practical method of learning a theory topic. I like the way people interact in assignments. Thanks so much.,4
17257,Good overview. Wish there were more take away documents as well as links to additional information that summarized content in each section so you had a course book with terms at the end.,4
17270,Course gives you good overview on different important data science technologies. Hands on labs are important to get the grip on concepts.,4
17274,"The contents of the course were good enough. The assignments, though simple required some work in terms of understanding the kind of data that you are dealing with, which is important. Although, a lot of content has been covered, it was arranged in a logical manner.",4
17278,recommend to improve assignment details,4
17284,"The course was very good - especially the map-reduce part I found very well explained and inspirational. The problem sets were thought-provoking and really taught me a lot.Two things that could be improved:1) The problem sets are really nice (again, map-reduce is the best one), but there are quite a few errors in the description, a lot of information is dated (e.g. in ps.1 the twitter link is old), and working with the grader can be very clumsy. See Machine Learning by Andrew Ng to see how to design perfect, easy to operate and submit problem sets. Perhaps work with PyCharm creators?2) The second to last part was a bit lacking - it was basically skimming though all different types of databases, which didn't make me feel like I really acquired any skill. Because of how little time was spent on each database type and there were so many, I don't really remember much of it now (hardly anything to be honest).",4
17287,"It gives good information, but frankly covers way too many tools at the end, and the explanations are good but somewhat rushed. Some parts were a little boring, as no immediate practical use seemed on the horizon.",4
17288,Definitely need some background in R or Python and the lectures are a bit old. Seem to be from around 2013 when this first came out but most of the info is still relevant.,4
17292,Good introduction to Big Data systems.,4
17294,"This is a great introduction. I would give it a higher scoring but was frustrated with one of the labs have issues in the grader and even after completion of the course its not clear what was wrong: the instructions, the solution data set, the input data set. Other then that enjoyed the content.",4
17298,I enjoyed this course and found it challenging. Good job!,4
17302,"covers a lot of ground quickly, but you still get a good understanding of the underlying theory or technologies",4
17306,Very usefull course. Great!,4
17311,"The power-point used has a lot of mistakes corrected live by the speaker.The speaker speech is sometime slow and not precise, it probably has been recorded only once.Apart from that the content covers the subject and the assignments are relevant and fun.",4
17319,"There are some inconsistencies in the course or the arrangement of the videos, maybe due to technical problems.For improvement I would really wish to have some substantial results, especially in the last week of the course. That is, I would prefer to discuss at least something in depth rather than everything broadly.",4
17327,Its pretty decent. I liked the assignments. However there were some typos in the lecture slides and also the grader output is not very friendly.,4
17329,Very good course! Interesting problem sets.,4
17331,"Very broad and instructive course with a good level of theory, many practical examples. Good teaching.Some nice assignments but a lake of assignement for the 4th weekI recommand this course",4
17334,Last week of the course is too much information and without any assignments it kind of doesn't make much sense and it doesn't stick.,4
17340,Great assignment and course design! Not easy for me.,4
17342,"Very good course, but lectures could be more tuned onto the home assignments. A lot of independent work for me at least. Teacher is very good.",4
17343,"The lecturer is very, very knowledgable and seems to explain the landscape of topics both from a grand perspective and deep knowledge.Though there are a wide variety of programming exercise,I would prefer some more in-depth assignments (as is usually the case with me and Coursera).",4
17344,Interesting intro to some powerful ideas,4
17349,"Excellent course content and lecture, however, the homework design is not so friendly for students.First, instructions are not clear. I spent a lot of time in figuring out the real meaning behind each problem. Second, the judge system is not so rigorous. Though trying best on homework and not playing tricks are students' responsibility, the judge system is just too weak to survive those hackings.Thank you all for your efforts.",4
17356,"I feel that there should be more assignments to make the course interesting. The last part just briefly explained about different database types but it also focused two lectures on Pig. There could be an assignment to make the lectures more meaningful or perhaps, a quiz. Otherwise, last week is too much information to grasp at once.",4
17358,it is very useful but easy enough,4
17359,Good Course for beginner in Data Scientist field. I recommend this course,4
17365,It is a comprehensive course for learning quite up-to-date technology and concept.,4
17369,Breaks down all complexity in Data Visualisation,4
17370,"It is worth the cost and effort, but ... four weeks did not provide enough time for the instructor to really demonstrate techniques for achieving the kind of results that are shown. The cost is low compared to other delivery mechanisms, but high compared to other, longer, more detailed, Coursera courses.",4
17373,I wish for more hands on work.,4
17382,"Interesting course, but too much theoretical data without providing sufficient practical tasks to remember it better.In other courses they used to have mini quizzes embedded into videos. They are usually very helpful, but here we got none of them.",4
17384,"I think the course is nice in general but I have one comment. I think there is too much information in the course videos and sometimes it is really hard to follow the video if you want to take notes. It would have been much better if the instructor gave some time between the slides for the watchers to digest. He doesn't have to stop but he could slowly go through a set of examples, even 30-60 secs would help.",4
17389,the third week requires learning a software package.,4
17390,This course was excellent. It provided not only an overview of what data visualisation is but it also proved to be sufficiently challenging regarding the assignments and quizzes. This was truly a university course.,4
17401,Great class,4
17406,"I like the course because it helps you make visualizations of different types of data by using very simple tools based on rich algorithms. I understand the fundamental concepts to discover patterns and relevant information from the data, applying some design rules in the software.",4
17412,"Quite clear, good for introduction",4
17423,"The course, The Craft of Setting and Description, allows students to delve into the skills needed for polished creative writing. Amity Gaige was a great instructor who provided exercises and lectures that stretched my imagination. I really enjoyed this course.",4
17429,it's amazing course that gave you a new point of view for writing and a very good training,4
17443,"Ms. Gaige very thoughtfully made it really practical rather than theoretical by bringing in examples of various writings from the past writers, adding in some videos as well for the learners to see it exactly for what something is, while making the points about what should you put into your writing and what you shouldn't. Would have liked a short goodbye video from her at the end though!!",4
17446,Great knowledge. Time consuming.,4
17448,"The creative writing series of classes have been extremely enjoyable. The classes are very well organized, the pace of the work was perfect for me. Wish there were another series of classes I could take.",4
17463,"I thought this course was very well done. The video lectures were very interesting, and the links to additional readings and videos was very welcome. Definitely one of the strongest segments of the creative writing specializations.",4
17468,"The course was inspiring and made me focus on the small details in the environments I create. I think that the professor leans too hard on the quotes and the work of other authors as a core part of the curriculum. It would have been useful to have a breakdown in charts or a checklist to help push our descriptions along. Having said that, the professor seems to care a great deal for her students and that came through clearly.",4
17475,"This class was pretty good. I liked the reading assignments, and there was some helpful instruction as well. I liked learning about the second person perspective, and the section on credibility and research was also really helpful.",4
17480,This is great course for challenging your perceptions of things and encouraging you to try out different perspectives.,4
17487,"Very good course, thanks!",4
17489,I enjoyed learning about how to create a vitamin rich unit of fiction and the importance of specific words.,4
17494,"I joined late, much too late to participate in many of the assignments with my busy schedule, but I took notes and read all the required reading. From this course I will take into my writing new, helpful skills. My favorite lesson was setting and description where I learned that the environment should not be described frivolously, but through the emotions and opinions of the character(s) who observe them. Thank you very much for your lessons, Amity Gaige, I'm now not as terrible as I was when I first started.",4
17499,Excellent course that both informs and inspires. There is a good deal of content as well as advice. The student writer is encouraged to explore and be unafraid. The only draw back is that the online classroom does not allow the auditing students to post and get feedback on their assignments and it must be done externally to fully get the benefit of our fellow students.,4
17502,very informative and need some improvements.,4
17507,Like it! Good information to get in touch with the experiences in accessibility that are occurring outside my country. :),4
17512,"A very practical and informative course, the links and readings are also very educational.",4
17517,"This course is great, but it took for ever to start!!",4
17521,Good course,4
17522,Great job,4
17525,Great course. For intermediate level it can be more inDEPTh.,4
17528,"Goes to the point, warns about thinking wrong about DS because of hype and lack of (scientific) sustainability.",4
17541,"The course can be described as the first hour lecture by the professor. It introduces students to data science, its uses and pitfalls.",4
17542,"Great course. Lot of complicated detail segmented and described in a way that was easy to digest. Thoughts for improvement are with the first few segments. The lessons didn't start with the ""why"". Why machine learning is used or what problem it solved. I had to google that in order to understand before the course which started with ""what"" it was.",4
17543,"I had gone through each session, it gives good understanding on the data science. My suggestion is to go through each session more than once. Both the faculties are great.",4
17544,very good introduction to DS.,4
17549,Good high level introduction to the field of data science.,4
17551,A good crash course eliciting the basic nuances of Data science,4
17555,"A good course. Very basic, but that's to be expected for an overview course.",4
17560,It is good informative course for beginners.,4
17562,Good overview of Data Science but lacking a bit of meat.,4
17563,"Extremely helpful and informative this was my first time experience going through an online training, i should say thanks team for making it so easy and effective :-)Looking forward for more sessions and positive experiences.",4
17564,Good overview course. Maybe include a few more examples that we can review offline.,4
17565,Excellent intro to the Data Science.,4
17566,Very useful introductory course to help you get familar with different fields in data science and typical data analysis procedures,4
17578,"a bit of mumbling in the videos, and some of the single/multiple answer buttons were incorrect.",4
17579,Gives good overview of data science. Maybe one example would have been better.,4
17580,"Great start, good examples and a very nice way to 'crash' into data sc!",4
17592,"Easy to follow without the jardon. Recommendation for those interested in statistics, Biostats, and looking to cost effectively learn or enhance skill sets.",4
17598,Clear and streamlined. I wish it could go deeper. Moving on with the other courses on the subject.,4
17599,good starting course; information well presented.,4
17601,"High level, but very informative.",4
17608,This course gives a brief idea about Data Science. It is helpful for the beginners.,4
17609,Good introductory course. A bit dry with no interaction with other students (the forums were not popular and there were no peer-graded assignments).,4
17610,Some questions confusing (with less than 5 so missing 1 was a fail) and a few videos were lacking written summaries. Other than that not bad,4
17613,some explanation was too technical too early,4
17616,Really good quick and dirty high level overview of how to structure and talk about data science projects. Great for improving communication about your project to your boss and people from outside of your team.,4
17620,Very basic introduction to data science. The class is well-organized and suitable for new learners of data science.,4
17622,High level overview - not technical at all.,4
17623,good introduction,4
17624,great to s,4
17625,Course Material is good however I felt trainer is not very much engaging with the audience. There is not liveliness in the way the videos are projected.,4
17626,"This was logically structured, yet interesting and engaging, great videos. The only thing that could make it better is more imagery for conveying some of the more complex ideas.",4
17634,A good first overview of what Data Science can do in the corporate context.,4
17636,A good course to learn all the basics of DATA SCIENCE !,4
17637,"I am a PhD biologist leading a team of data analysts. I found this course to be quick and easy to follow, well presented, and extremely helpful. The instructors are truly professional and they excel in this medium, I was very impressed. Thanks Coursera and Johns Hopkins!",4
17638,some of the content and videos were too wordy and had more theory v/s examples.,4
17639,"While the course has excellent material, I would not send any of my executives to it. The information is to deep and technical for a business executive in my opinion. I would have liked more examples on how implementing this would benefit a business.",4
17640,Solid executive level overview of the domains involved in leading a Data Science program.,4
17647,"The material is of a good level, it is a good first introduction to the field.",4
17649,Great course for managers that what to start understanding the most relevant concepts about the data science area and how to apply it in practice.,4
17654,A solid but gentle introduction,4
17658,Good intro to data science and has given overall information what a data scientist actually do in a high level.,4
17661,Great\,4
17665,A very good introduction to Data Science!!,4
17669,Good for getting a quick summary of what Data Science is for those new to the field.,4
17673,Very good and brief overview of the topic.,4
17675,Information is well presented and keeps a good pace. Quizzes could be improved.Additional material is very good and interesting.,4
17682,"It would be good to be able to complete the quizzes even if you are not paying for the certificate, this would enable people to understand how much they have taken away from the class.",4
17683,I was quite satisfied with the content of this course.,4
17686,Great beginning to Data Science,4
17689,Great! Very interesting & informative.,4
17690,It is a good introductory course in Data Science,4
17696,Good introductory course for Data Science,4
17697,Great Learning,4
17704,"fairly general concepts of data science, but may be quite helpful l for people totally new to the field of data (e.g. not having any idea), or as material to review the big picture of data science",4
17707,"Quite basic material... If you have some technical background you might fund this course not so useful.However, I think that it does provide the right information for non-technical managers in a simple and comprehensive way.Personally, I wish it was a bit longer and deeper to feel like I acquired more knowledge to take it to the next level independently.",4
17709,"Provided a good, very high level overview. I audited so I didn't take the quizzes, but the questions were all on the general side. I liked how they used some examples of real-life research.",4
17710,Quick and concise. A great deal of knowledge acquired.,4
17711,Was a good introduction. The focus was good as I feel I came away with knowledge of the field as opposed to technology. Only recommendation is to ask professors to use more practical examples in the lectures.,4
17718,I would have liked a bit more detail and some more examples from business perspective. But I am sure there will be a more advanced course that I could take.,4
17720,It is helpful for those who want to get an overview of what data science is all about.,4
17729,Good overview course. Better for managerial folks than data engineers/scientists.,4
17733,Enjoyed the structure.,4
17740,I have studied this course as part of the Executive Data Science Specialization. I think this set of four courses meet my objectives by providing a very nice overview on the key points of data science projects. They are good to give a flavor on data science and data science projects helping decide if you want to search for more in depth knowledge.,4
17749,Good short introduction to the field who someone with minimal understanding of data science.,4
17752,"The course touches upon most important topics in Data Science but doesn't go deep into the topics:- Covers most important important topics in Data Science on high level.- Course works as a ""refresher"" to follow the course you should know the basics in statistics and modelling. Concepts like parsimonious model would be used with expectation that student already knows it.",4
17755,"Good crash course, presents relevant concepts quickly",4
17760,Very well organized course ..Short and to the point,4
17765,Great value to get started; especiall,4
17767,"While to introductory, yet very good.",4
17768,A satisfactory overview of the Data Science Specialization.,4
17771,Very good introduction to the topic and also clarifies some terms that are in the air and end up misleading. like inference prediction and machine learning.,4
17774,Good course for someone wanting to familiarize themselves with Data Science and understand the basics.,4
17776,Provides a quick overview on what constitutes Data Science.,4
17779,Good general introduction.,4
17780,This course is a really good starting point for people new to the field of data science. I come from a data warehousing and historical analysis background and I found this course useful.,4
17785,Very light overview.,4
17790,A nice starting for those wanted to understand data science.,4
17792,"Advises are really good. The course charges too much! A one week course should set a reasonable price, for instance, $19.",4
17793,"A very articulate orientation, which meticulously arouses interest about different corners of Data Science.",4
17796,"Quite fast-paced indeed. Even the instructors seem like they're in a rush :)It would have helped if there was a glossary of terms for people who aren't well-versed in programming basics.But in summary, it's an interesting course =)))",4
17800,Good overview. I would,4
17801,I left with a good understanding of the reach and dynamics of the field of data science. Even with experience in using data to answer questions in the context of an organization this has been a good way of mapping out the areas where that experience can be extended.,4
17803,"A very good intro to Data Science by three experts. Well-paced, with reasonable quiz questions and can be completed in less than a week. However, I would certainly not pay for it, because it is feels more like a well-designed ad for the spesialization that follows!",4
17807,The crash course was easy to understand. The classes used good examples to give you visual details about the subject and the instructors were clear and precise.,4
17808,"1.Concise and well structured.2. Allows me to think about the core and the essentials.3. Creates the basics on which I can learn further, deep dive and build expertise.",4
17812,"As the title of the course says, it's a Crash Course.Quick, simple, effective in giving you the very basic terminologies, use cases of Data Sciences.",4
17815,Nice one :),4
17821,Good One.,4
17822,"The course offers a solid overview of data science. If you have little to no familiarity with the field, I recommend taking a few hours to go through the course.",4
17823,Short and sweet :),4
17825,A good course to begin with data science,4
17826,It's really a nice introductory course for Data Science!,4
17827,"A really useful introduction to what is data science. I found it very complete, besides maybe I would have liked a little more deepness in some concepts. I'm willing to learn more about the subject, maybe I will complete the whole specialization.",4
17833,"I really liked it. Some of tje jargon was a bit technical though. But overall really appriated the opportunity yo learn,",4
17835,need to get a bit more specific about the tools required,4
17842,Very good course to understanding the nuances of Data science and various tools used.,4
17844,"Overall a compact course, illustrations could be better.",4
17845,A good course to start to learn data analytic vocabulary.,4
17850,A good introduction to anybody interested in learning what is data science.,4
17853,Quick scope of data science. I particularly liked the discussion about fad versus fact towards the end of the course. Some questions in quizzes seemed a bit arbitrary. The course delivers what it promises; crash-course with the key ingredients for understanding more about what data science is about,4
17855,Very crash course that gives you a taste about the different aspects of data science and makes you want to dive in the specialization program right away!,4
17862,"great introduction to field, but there is lack of examples of bad usage data science methods and tools",4
17863,Great for an overview of the different aspects of data science.,4
17864,"I really enjoyed this course, it gives me lot of new, interesting knowledge about data science, But there are some mistake about good (clean) programming. Please do not use comments, the comments show strange code, do not write big function etc... Clean code book from Uncle Bob helps me a lot of to write clean, maintainable code.",4
17867,This course was truly a crash course with less crashing and more succeeding on the parts of the professors. My only suggestion is to more clearly outline and link the next classes in the specialization.,4
17871,Many tools and methods beyond the power of Tableau,4
17876,"Some topics need a better explanation, and the programming assignments should go along the topics.",4
17878,"Nice learnings, horrible experience with the exercises.",4
17890,I liked the course because it allowed me to complete it in my own time. The material was well documented. I would have liked to have my questions answered in real-time and interactively maybe to others taking the course. There were some quiz questions that didn't reflect the material in the course so I got lost and had to find my own answers on the internet. Overall...I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn medical terminology.,4
17893,"This course is very complete in terms of vocabulary and helpful for people who haven't been in a hospital or clinic before to get and idea of how these settings work. The only thing I would have wished for this course to have a little more vocabulary is on diseases, conditions and procedures.",4
17900,"With this course I learned to go through a data problem from the scratch and get a real data product, and document it. My only constructive comment is that, when reviewing the projects of classmates, there is a huge dispersion on the effort and quality of the products presented, from very basic and simple Apps to a very professional products, and the scoring of them all is quite the same, perhaps one or two points of difference, in eleven points maximum score.",4
17903,"Very interesting, but Capstone is much more difficult than the rest of the course.Be sure to study carefully the first courses, and don't rush.",4
17906,"Although this project is very open-ended with little guidance, it definitely requires the ""full-stack"" of data science to complete.",4
17918,Really great course to apply all the techniques learned earlier in the specialization.,4
17923,"Good scenario and a good learning opportunity. I don't think the quizzes related well to the problem we were trying to solve and introduced a red herring, however. Predicting the next best word is not the same as predicting the relative probability of 4 words where one is the ""right answer"" but not necessarily the best prediction of a text prediction algorithm.",4
17925,"The Capstone Project makes you summarizes what you have learnt so far and take it to the next level, natural language processing . Besides, the ability to create a working app is a reward by itself.It is challenging and interesting at the same time.",4
17927,Good test of what we learned in the courses.,4
17928,"This is not for beginners with no experience. The estimated weekly hours are absurdly low.No one has seen any sign whatsoever of the industry partner, SwiftKey, despite claims they will be around to help. The field has advanced dramatically since the course was developed. Be prepared to do a lot of research and trial and error.The specialization has been an excellent way to learn a fair amount on the topic, but it is just the beginning. The capstone will challenge you. It is rewarding when you complete it.",4
17934,A good & fun idea to implement. Would have prefered implementing my own idea though.,4
17935,"Overall a good course that makes you learn a lot on your own (unlike the rest of the series). Maybe a bit too much self learning. However, if you can complete it does give you a lot of learning especially in some text analysis which hasn't been covered before.",4
17937,Good and interesting project.,4
17940,"I enjoyed the course. This course took me waaaay more time than I thought because I struggled with a few issues. First, I wish I'd started by taking the NLP online course before starting the Capstone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aMYz1tMfPg). There was an issue installing RWeka, RJava and it took me several days to work through the issues. I eventually moved to using quanteda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quanteda/vignettes/quickstart.html). I also waited far too long to develop a method to test my model using a subset of the training data, so I could test whether changes to my model improved and reduced performance. It turns out that my model trained on a 25% sample performed just as well as a model trained on 100%. I'm thankful for the Discussion Forum and final peer review process. Both helped me learn how I can improve my model and demo application. I really appreciate the instructors for creating this specialization. I've learned a lot.",4
17946,This is a great capstone project. It requires the student to really have an understanding of the concepts learned throughout the specialization and apply them to build a prediction app. There is very little guidance asides from the discussion forum which could be discouraging at first. Otherwise I would've rated it 5 stars.,4
17972,This pretty good but maybe should explore more than just theory septma chords blues and jazz encganche something that although is very good explanation leaves you anelando something more modern.,4
17976,"Great course! just it misses some of the basics. Fortunately I already knew how to read a pentagram and note lengths so it was OK for me, but the ""True"" beginners had a little bit of an issue with time lengths at first",4
17977,"Excellent, easy to understand for starters.",4
17979,Well-organized industrial know-hows and useful concepts of business model,4
17990,"It's an introductory course to key Pattern Discovery techniques with a comprehensive coverage of important subjects. However, it should be complemented by following the referenced material in order to obtain a wider and more complete picture of the field.",4
17992,Should be more support in the forum for quiz and assignement,4
17994,The course exercises are medium-hard. But the topic coverage is spot on.,4
17996,"I learned a lot from this lecture. And I believe the lecture is excellent except that if he could become a little bit funny, then it would be perfect. Thanks,Clark",4
17999,"I like this course. Its provides a good base for pattern discovery, with useful high level techniques, this can be used as a starting point.Something to improve can be incorporating at least one lesson with best practice coding techniques to solve the practical exercises.",4
18004,"Great course, covers wide range of contents relating to Could technology. Quiz is very well designed to test your understanding.",4
18005,Good class overall. I was not really a fan of the teaching styles at the beginning because they pack a lot of info and just keep going. Examples are pretty rare and quizzes require you to have an analytical understanding of the material which you can't get from the lectures themselves easily.,4
18006,"This is a great introduction for someone who wants to see what's available in terms of open source and proprietary cloud systems. The lectures definitely cover items that people actually use in industry, and the lecturers describe the technologies in products accurately.",4
18010,Really good course for distributed funda!,4
18016,"I would like to recommend the course for everybody to want get good knowledge in cloud technology. It's help me a lot to figure out the market trends. From now on, I got a big picture about the differents types of the clould services. I very excited to the next step. I also to hope you enjoy it.",4
18018,"At the start of Week 1, the course was a bit boring (too slow, too easy), but things were becoming more and more interesting: We were able to see many up-to-date technologies used in companies, several protocols, market tendencies, many competitors/actors,I recommend to students to open an account at AWS, Azure, GoogleCompute and create their own exercises (it is mostly free for limited usage).",4
18021,"The course is really good. However, in some situations, it is very high level and the instructor assumes that the audience know what he say. I would prefer to see some other figures for the cloud use and the use of the cloud in reality.",4
18030,Colorful information about various advanced technologies in cloud computing.,4
18031,interesting topics but explanation is sometimes unclear,4
18035,very good course for data structure,4
18039,"The course is really good, I've learned a lot. The only thing I am not happy about, is lack of posibility to check the assignments without having bought the course.",4
18047,Rebalance of the content could make the course even better. There were too many topics at week 4. Tries should be discussed in another week. The example code in the main at week 5 was a very good idea. Similar solution would make the understanding better during the other weeks.,4
18056,Again the explanation and representation was good.3.5-4 stars for some Data Structures and their performance. Few basic ideas and introduction about the gui of the project would make it 5stars.,4
18063,Thank you.,4
18064,Too much information in the StarterCode t,4
18065,Good one. Nicely paced. Necessary challenge included..,4
18067,Covers basics well. The video lectures are easy and simple to understand. Liked the assignments and they covered the learned content well.,4
18075,Could be more challenging. But I really enjoyed the course!!! Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn java and data structures.,4
18091,Great course,4
18104,"Good but it was also good to let the students do some of the codings, I found the coding part actually very simple and short",4
18105,I really liked this. Learnt a lot in java. Would have been a 5 start had it included some more optional assignments that appear in competitive programming contests like ACM-ICPC.,4
18112,"not bad,but too simple for me",4
18120,The overall course is good. But might touch too little on Big O? Not sure. But still good course!,4
18126,The course is extremely good. It would be still better if there is inclusion of basics to create a UI.,4
18130,"The lectures, assignments, and projects all encourage you to learn about how to design and use optimal search algorithms for text-based applications. I especially value how the discussions present the material in way that is relatively easy to see how it relates to search routines in general. My only complaint is that the instructions do not inform you about the constraints that the online grader implicitly imposes on you. This unfortunately meant that I was not able to submit code with further optimizations that I came up with.",4
18131,"The content includes interesting and useful Java programming examples. The lecturers are generally on top of their subject matter and can speak confidently without visible notes. The tests are thorough and you won't get away with only half-knowledge. If you take all the lectures and study the slides, you will generally get to the necessary level of understanding.",4
18149,Nice . But It could have been better if we ourselves were supposed to make the Trees and Tries instead of relying on the java's built in classes. I learned a lot!,4
18155,Loved it,4
18165,Good course to understand the basics of data structures and performance of different data structure implementations,4
18172,"great course, but the assignments are somewhat easy....",4
18177,Amazing video lectures that help in understanding the concepts quickly. In video quizzes help make sure your thought process is right.But The assignments are way too simple if we follow all the steps provided. Assignments have to be more challenging. Surely 5 stars if they add more challenging assignments to this course.,4
18183,Very good lectures.,4
18186,Very well structured. Information complete and good exercises.,4
18188,One of the better programming classes. Definitely recommended.,4
18190,I can tell the tutors spent time on preparing the course. This is the most well-organized coursera course I took.,4
18204,but more depth is required,4
18208,worth taking,4
18213,Interesting assignments. Concise video lectures.,4
18216,The content that has been showed through this course is enough balanced and sufficient to help learners around the world like me to understand clearly Data Structures with java and also for with the other programming languages.,4
18217,Amazing course! Very clear explanation of data structures and some basic algorithms. Very good preparation for the interviews.The only drawback is that the lecture slides are not available for downloading.,4
18227,"Good, a lot about research and collecting data.",4
18237,It is very informative for beginners.,4
18247,"way to beginner, felt it could've gone a bit more in depth coming from a known university such as Duke.",4
18249,I think it's too simple....... I finished this course in 2 days.,4
18264,Nice introducing course.,4
18268,The programming development environments BIC & DLTP are very helpful. BIC with the Chrome console helped get unstuck on a couple of occasions. The presentations & the exercises effectively impart the basic concepts.It would be really nice if the quizzes have a button to confirm answers separate from the button to submit.,4
18273,Good paced exercises.,4
18274,Interesting introduction to programming.,4
18289,"Very nice and organized but the ""Try it"" exercises should be made easier to read and divided to small steps instead of long paragraphs",4
18305,"It is good course for beginners , it gives you overview of HTML, CSS and Javascript",4
18306,"good teacher, very nice video and practical task",4
18320,The way the proffessors deliver there speech is amazing and in a very lucid manner.One-Liners questions between the videos is really a nice way to enhace students mind so he remains involved and keeping him/her bound to that topic.I really appreciate the efforts of proffessors who taught me and all other students out there selflessly and with utmost devotion wihout asking anything in return.SPECIAL THANKS TO COURSERA.,4
18326,Very helpful and interesting! Thank you :),4
18333,"Excellent Program for me and all the students, which have basic knowledge and a passion for learning something more.",4
18342,It was a great experience! Very nice instructors and content!,4
18358,Decent introduction. Should consider more assignments with automated submissions. Maybe bonus assignments with automated submissions just to develop a broader introduction to different parts of the various languages discussed.,4
18364,"Nicely explained but a bit boring for me. i believe that is my fault, because i don't like web design and i also knew a lot of the things in this course",4
18369,"We need more quizzes, want to make projects and to check them",4
18371,"Was very good, but the titles of week 3 and 4 threw me off since I thought they would be seperate weeks, not the same one.",4
18378,"The content was very useful, especially the lessons that focused on applying the scientific method to computer science. I liked the fact that most concepts were taught, and then reviewed again at the end of a video, solidifying what I learned. I did find the quality of the videos to be rather lacking. As someone who develops online courses for a living, I suggest using two cameras so that you can switch between two views when a cut is needed to prevent jumping or leaving mistakes in videos. The professors definitely seemed nervous, but I suppose that goes away with time. Thank you for this awesome course!",4
18379,I have written a review when I gave my feedback.,4
18380,decent course for the beginners though it can cover more detail study of the topics.,4
18383,This course is a great course. It gives you concepts and teach you how to apply them. It also provide good exercises and programming problems.I was just wanted the course to add more materials and more lectures about HTML and CSS.Thank You for this great course.,4
18391,"A great and fun way to learn fundamentals of programming and basics of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Exercises were simple and very good to reinforce what was learned on each session, plus they included challenge exercises for those who need something a little less basic.",4
18396,"The programming environments used in this course probably won't be used in real life, they are used to get the very basics of programming.But I recommend it for absolute beginners with no knowledge of computer science whatsoever,someone who already knows at least one programming language already will probably be bored by the semantics, but what I really found useful was the step by step explanation on how how to solve programming problems, without using a block scheme or intuition.No teacher ever explained that in detail to me before.I heard they are cutting out the steganography project, or adding it as something optional, but that was actually very fun, hiding images in other images, as though I was a spy, sending off a message that would save that world...But,laughs aside,it felt like I was doing something practical.",4
18398,This course is good for beginners!!,4
18401,was helpful in laying the foundations of my programming skills,4
18403,Im very happy to see that the authors improved the course by actually showing the students how to integrate JS and HTML. I still can't understand why its not allowed the access to the projects to students that won't purchase the course. There are several of other courses @Coursera that require payment only if you want the certificate. I guess that hundreds of students would be happy to see that as the general procedure.Thanks to all the authors for such a wonderful material. Im continuing to the 2nd level of the specialisation.,4
18406,The last module felt like I really had to apply my brain here!,4
18409,Awesome experience>,4
18417,"I am really learning how to create a website. The instructors/professors, that are teaching this course, and the way the online classes are set up, make easy to follow and easy to understand. I did not expect something like this online, right to the point no fluff class type teaching, besides I've always want to learn how to read and right behind the scene website, instead of making it from PowerPoint, and not understand why idea is not being executed.",4
18427,it is a very good course. Just need some adjustments on week 3 and steganography extraction and duplication.,4
18428,"This course teaches absolute basics when it comes to programming, with a few tips that give you an edge when it comes to professional coding.",4
18429,"It's a great course to learn the basics, plus you get testimonials about how some are doing in the business. Mostly younger college students but never the less, still useful.",4
18432,"It was great to finally get to know about things I've been wondering for a long time. I got lost from time to time and struggled to keep up but, at the end I think I get the benefits the course was meant to provide.",4
18438,"It's a great course up to when you start dealing with arithmetic calculations. I was wishing for a clearer explanation.Also, something about explaining the structure of the coding, i.e. the syntax, the tokens, etc. that are being taught seems to be missing.Otherwise, teachers are great and the course is very engaging.",4
18444,This course is Amazing! I learned a lotabout webpages and how to style them. It only fails because we don't see an example of javascript on a real webpage.,4
18447,A real webpage implementation of Javascript can be included in the course.,4
18449,"My previous review is : This course teaches NOTHING about JAVA! Does not worth the money and time!After I learned more about coding I realized I was wrong that it is very important to understand HTML, CSS and JS before learning Java. The only thing is that I wish this course teaches more algorithm.",4
18455,It was really helpful and I really feel like I learned a lot!! Can't wait to start the next course!!,4
18465,"This is a great course. Teachers are full of energy and desire to teach, examples are easy to follow (not so much at the end) but it is a great course where you will learn a lot. Highly recommended.",4
18472,"The HTML and CSS portions as well as the beginning javascript lessons are great. However, towards the end of this module the instructors seem to stop teaching and/or expect knowledge way above 'beginning' that make it necessary for me to teach myself way more than I expected.",4
18473,"It is pretty fast paced, I wish there was more studymaterial to help prepare you for the quizzes.",4
18475,"HTML, CSS and JS materials were covered and were made easy to understand. CodePen and the Write Your Own websites cooperate great with the course. The quizzes are simple while I found he coding practice challenging and yet not too difficult.My only concern is whether the materials covered would help to build a realistic website, say, the homepage of Facebook or Google. It seems though I've finished the course, I still have no idea of how those webpages I see everyday works, let alone code them myself. The following courses in this series focus on Java, so ...By the way, spending 2-3 hours for a week to finish it as soon may help against forgetting. HTML, CSS and JS seem disconnected before you make them cooperate. Cheers!",4
18482,Precise teaching. Informative.,4
18483,Very good and excellent teachers. I have a lot from the coursera,4
18484,Great info!,4
18485,Great!! so far,4
18493,This is a good course for beginners but for the more experienced web programmers this is like a good brain teaser only.,4
18494,The javascript section was very good and helped me develop my programming skills. I really like the seven step approach and using it work through the exercises. The HTML and CSS sections were not very useful though.,4
18503,Steganography Wasn't upto the mark..!,4
18504,it covers a wide range of material in fairly quick order.,4
18505,"Nice course. However I do not understand why javascript is treated in a way that separates it absolutely from its web-related applications (it is treated as a general purpose programming language, which it is nowadays, especially once node.js came to the fore, but still - it is primarily web language and it would be better to treat it as such, even more so when the rest of the course is focused on html and css.",4
18509,"interesting programming topics selected. Modifying image is something that everyone could relate to as everyone must have encountered with digital image before.The use of pencode which is WYSIWYG editor makes it more interactive and current. A huge improvement from the plain, boring Python platform and text editor.Most of the instructors facial expression are so dead, and flat-voice delivery makes it a chore to watch. Think how youtube tutorials engage their audience and makes it entertaining to watch. But maybe that's too much to ask for a traditional institutional lecture.Overall, this is one of the best intro to programming video I have watched. The lessons choice are relevant and could be followed with ease.",4
18520,pretty good but very time consuming,4
18522,Good course. A little demanding for someone who cannot invest substantial time figuring out how to code some problems.,4
18524,Javascript was a bit challenging and complicated but in general it was very useful. Thanks!,4
18530,"Lectures are boring but the assignments are interesting and useful for the future, and quite involved.",4
18544,Great introduction to the use of Javascript and how to publish a simple interactive webpage.,4
18545,I really enjoy taking this course. I have learnt a lot since i started,4
18546,"Very good course for beginners, but some of the practical examples could have been done better.For example it would have been nice if the course had taught how to execute JS code directly from a webpage, with or without using CodePen.This is the only reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.",4
18553,"very nice soft start into programming, for someone who has some background would not be challenging but encourage them to continue through this specialization where it will be more challenging through the specialization",4
18556,"Overall the course was great, with a nice variety of topics and plenty of time to complete it. Difficulty wise, the course was not difficult, however, some sections were a little bit confusing. Specifically regarding the JavaScript portion, some of the instructor videos that I viewed didn't really help and instead caused extensive use of outside for help. Sometimes the instructors would seem a little bit unprepared for the presentation as well, resulting in videos a little bit less polished than it could've been.",4
18561,great course for beginners,4
18562,This is a great intro but it's only going to get your feet wet (if not barely humid).,4
18564,Good but I think the java script they jump into very advanced stuff if you have never code before.,4
18565,"Good course. Sometimes too easy, but go to start.",4
18581,"Granted it's an online course so there's not the back and forth provided at a physical classroom. However, the presentation of content is efficient and if an individual puts in enough time and effort, they'll get what they're looking from with this course.",4
18583,"The course was really good. I am web application developer myself and I learned some new things here. One of the most important things that I learned here was Steganography. It was a new concept for me and I'm glad I learnt it. The JavaScript part of this course I must say, was very poor. It wasn't designed for beginners like the course mentioned. You could have taught some basic JavaScript stuff instead of just focusing on image manipulation. Anyways, great effort teachers! Thank You for teaching us.",4
18584,Everything apart from Steganography was well explained with examples. I liked that the quizzes were fairly engaging and required programming exercises to familiarize you with the content.,4
18587,HTML and CSS are good. Javascript is not adequately covered.,4
18588,"A good introduction to programming in general and in relation to web apps. A lot of focus on just a few problems, mainly graphics manipulation but a good starting point I think. Looking forward to learning much more in future courses.",4
18591,"The content of CSS and HTML are really good in this course, but the details about the JavaScript Code are not sufficient, this let me hard to understand the JavaScript.",4
18593,"So far I enjoyed and learned to many concepts about programing, I have none technical background so for me this is like learning a complete new language with different alphabet, they explain in a clear way, with examples and easy language, the Javascript part could be more specific but it is fine.",4
18594,"The course is great. Loved the HTML and CSS basics. I do have a couple of recommendations for javascript part.There was no example of how to integrate javascript to an HTML page. i.e., just a small example of a web page where user can upload an image and then process it would give a complete understanding of javascript. I do understand that this specialization is for Java so you don't want to concentrate on js much but that would be helpful.The steganography example seem a bit complicated for people who are new to programming. I personally loved it and in-fact found it very useful to not just program but also to learn more optimal programming but in the courses that I checked, most students seems to be struggling. You may want to revisit the video introducing steganography. I would still suggest you to keep this as part of curriculum.",4
18595,Very helpful course in understanding basics of internet and website design.,4
18602,Nice... the final assignment stegonography I found was difficult to convert RGB pixel values to 8 bit decimal values,4
18606,very good professors. course really helped a lot. thanku coursera,4
18615,"Good overall beginner course but definitely for the beginners. Only the last week may be interesting to people that already know a bit about HTML and CSS, as the JavaScript part at the end has some interesting assignments; like hiding an image in another image.",4
18617,Good learning start to learn web development :)thanks,4
18622,Pretty useful entry-level course!,4
18624,"Great course, very edifying.",4
18628,javascript was disconnected to html and css a little bit.,4
18645,It's fast paced but you do learn a great deal.,4
18647,"some of the quizzes felt haphazard and too specific, but overall, the material was timely and well presented.",4
18650,"The teachers explain everything very clearly, but the guest videos are a little pointless",4
18651,Great Course... Challenging for the grey cells :),4
18662,Week 4 was a big leap from week 3. Difficult with less time to complete the project. But course was good . I think course could be extended by adding 2 more weeks so that more practice sessions could be given to students.,4
18666,Needs better explaining on Java Script!,4
18686,Looking forward for week 2!,4
18696,"i see course must be require for every engineer ,that because the new technology and last updata of data",4
18701,"Everything very very good, except discrepancies grading the final quiz of m1w2... Question 3.",4
18703,Its a nice overall introduction to what's coming in the following courses.,4
18707,"Great and useful first week about visualization, although I wish it would cover more material . The ethics and cloud computing felt somewhat incomplete, but useful as well.",4
18708,"Good class, very effective hands-on homework tasks. One thing I found is that the time for homework is very underestimated by course creators. It takes much longer to complete the tasks than indicated and within time given. Otherwise, very happy with taking the class.",4
18709,"The instructions are very good, and it's nice to work on real big data. Also it is very helpful for hearing information about how a data scientist should consider problems carefully. Without taking the class, it wouldn't be easy for me to rationalize for example cost and sensitivity issues.However I took out one star because of the instruction for the final assignment being out of date. Although the task it self is not too hard to figure out. The initial instruction on how to start using AWS was outdated.",4
18720,"First professor was incredibly good at giving an overview over design choices in data visualizations.Second professor sadly somehow spoke too fast and had less of a red thread through his presentations.The first and second week of courses were good, the third week however was too hypothetical and one-sided.",4
18721,Excellent content. Detractors were some of the lectures had a continual popping in the audio and the instructions for the final assignment seemed a little dated and required a bit more work to figure out the correct steps.,4
18725,This is a very good course for experts as well as beginners . Quiz assignments were very challenging . I like the concept of practice and solved quiz,4
18727,"Very nice introductory course, broad explanation of traditional logic gates and synthesis tools. Graded Exercises and Practice exercises are chosen perfectly to grasp the topic",4
18729,"I already had done a digital logic course before. But, this course is different from that, as it is much more formal in describing a digital system. In this courses, the emphasis is on systems which is much welcome. The Processor topic is very interesting.Although the videos could be made a little better. The content is interesting, but the presentation is a little dull.I write this review after 4 weeks into the course. And, I personally am enjoying it.",4
18730,This course helps me to understood the complexity of moving to the cloud and to learnt Best Practices and Guidelines can help me to define roadmap to cloud.,4
18732,"Taught by leading practitioners, the course presents realities that often buyers must be aware before embarking on the Cloud . In the next revision Authors could consider condensing the last two weeks content, which are generic in nature.",4
18738,"Great course, well-constructed and very informative.",4
18745,probability theory was a bit fast but otherwise it was awesome!,4
18746,at time the formulas are given without proof or intuitive explanations. overall a good basic level course,4
18747,Great course except for the instructor videos for week 4,4
18755,"Refreshing your BasicsThe whole course is a just brushing up your basic math. The videos are brief and to the point, and problems make you use your brains and they are not right out of the video or any other reading material. I feel only Bayes and binomial theorem videos are not comprehensive and the problems a quite challenging.",4
18756,Material was well presented. Exercises could have been more involved; likely would have enhanced the learning.,4
18760,Good course. I feel like Week 4 could have been explained slightly better but otherwise I really enjoyed it.,4
18776,Suitable for high school students. For a University student it can be easily finished in 1-2 days.,4
18780,"Maybe the course should be split in two, the one using NodeRed and the without",4
18783,An excellent intro to developing IoT applications with IBM platform. General programming knowledge is enough to go through the course with the only exception of last exercise where knowledge of JavaScript will make things much easier. I give only 4 stars because some screenshots inn the videos don't match current versions of IBM Bluemix platform.,4
18785,Assignment 5 could have been explained clearer.,4
18788,"The course is a very good introduction into a lot of areas connected to IoT from an IBM perspective. nodeRED, Python on the Raspberry Pi, the SenseHat, node.js, etc. are very powerful tools.In Yianna's videos, the sound quality could be optimized significantly to improve the experience.Thank you!",4
18789,This course look easy but the assignments are not so straightforward. It is a interesting and challenging course. Encourage people who are interested in IOT should take this course.,4
18792,"Challenging if not a developer and grader needs very specific code. that aside, this was a fun interesting course, great intro to bluemix and Node-red and js. Need to allow significant time to research around content taught and decomposing programming assignments takes time. Make use of forums and post queries - peers answer as well as staff. You Learning in IBM suggests 12 hours - most on forums were taking 6-10 hours per assignment! Overall this was a good intro course",4
18796,"Great course along with hands on. I enjoyed hands on although I was new to Javascript, IOT and Python but course made me to learn these things in details.",4
18802,Very good course for the beginners to understand IoT concepts.,4
18807,Course was well organized. The sequence was very helpful to understand the concept by first using bluemix application and then sequentially moving to using API based application in bluemix and raspberry pi. But felt assigments description needs some improvement. For few assigments grader failed if there is extra valid 'if' statement. I felt grader should not be so strict to not accept valid javascript statements.Some of the lecture content were not up to date which caused problem in generating successful results.But overall a very nice Course. Thanks you.,4
18809,"Informative class as far as how to use an IoT service to set up, publish and analyze your data. I do recommend brushing up on Javascript as with every assignment, it became more apparent you need to have some background in Javascript to complete the work. Otherwise you'd spend way more time on learning the language than learning the topic in class, which ended up being the case for me.",4
18812,Very good course - very good for learning - some of the later assignments does get a bit chaotic which takes the focus a bit away from what you learned. But overall really good.,4
18816,"It was a really good introduction to both concepts, tools and offerings, I would recommend anyone interested in IoT and IBM Bluemix to take this course.",4
18820,"Very Good. Lot of new learning and understanding.. I liked the responsiveness of Discussion forum is great. It helped a lot as learning new subject..Points for improvement: Video may rerecorded as screens are different now in bluemix... I also there are material to learn on this IoT platform, like Blockchain Managed Device and Edge Analytics, it would have been covered in this course..",4
18842,This is a practical hands on course with very responsive teaching staff. On mature reflection I personally wish I had made the time for a python tutorial before starting that assignment. Most of it is javascript though and probably the same holds if you are unfamiliar with javascript/nodejs programming - do a tutorial first. Overall I had some fun with this and I learnt new stuff. I had to use a simulator for the SenseHat; it probably would increase the fun factor if you have a real SenseHat.,4
18844,A very interesting course with a lot of practice.I learn how IBM bluemix work. The weak point is that the assignment must be more clear and with more explication.,4
18848,Lots of great information with access to excellent resources. But also lots of typos in the notes and missing steps in the instructions.,4
18849,Very good introduction to IoT,4
18851,"Nicely done and well crafted course here. It explains clearly what is IoT in theory and with hands-on project. For the cons, maybe should be better pointed out that specific hardware prerequisites are required. Also, I found it's a little bit too IBM-centric course.",4
18852,The course is awesome. Not too lengthy video with good explanation. The only drawback is the audio quality of some of the lectures.,4
18864,"The Course Content is very good, no doubt about that. But there is some scope for improvement in the operations of the course conduct. Like assignments. It is completely peer graded and hence subjective. There should be a certain % weight for peer grading and % for instructor or examiner grading.Also I was given low marks in one of the assignments but when i re-submitted the exact same thing, some one else gave me 100 % marks. These things should be looked into. Some objectivity in grading would be helpful",4
18873,"I enjoyed the class much, however I would suggest that a little more for feedback could be provided to questions raised by students. Also, PLEASE make the slides available for ALL the lessons.",4
18874,I think the final project grading is a bit confusing.,4
18879,The course is really helpful,4
18882,Very interesting to progess beyond a pure technical approach.Then some modules are really to much verbose and may be much more effective with more examples,4
18884,"Good content, good opportunity to practice. But the teacher is very fast sometime",4
18885,Very good at explaining design principles and to get the students thinking of making simple visualizations that convey a story.,4
18891,it helped me to remember the importance of diversity. Many times we tend to prefer teams with less diversity just because it is easier to manage. This course is a good reminder of what should be done,4
18896,"Very good assignments, honors track.",4
18901,"Overall , it is a very interesting course.But I would like to say , that there are too many interviews. I think that it is a little bit difficult for some non-native speaker to understand the main and important things from the interview, because some interviewers talked in a very loose way. So I would suggest our teacher , to summarize the main points of those interview in a better way .",4
18902,"Excellent course providing not only the knowledge of algorithms but also useful insights into developing and maintaining recommender systems. Only thing that could use some work is the assignments. Spreadsheet assignment in week 4 is poorly designed (as evidenced by many forum threads with people not knowing what is it that the authors actually want). Other than that, that was an extremely helpful course.",4
18903,Very good content ! Very interesting interviews with expert in the field that shows real examples. However the exercise needs a bit more work to be very useful.,4
18904,"I think this is very useful for introductory, but it lacks some references for who wants go deeper.",4
18911,Excellent course. Everything concise but well explained. Nice activities and quizes.,4
18913,Great information presented clearly.,4
18914,It would be great if mentors/instructors can promptly follow up with students' requests/problems.,4
18916,This was the first course in the specialization where I learned something new. People with any experience with Tableau should probably start with this course.,4
18917,"This course was more focused on tableau, The examples were basic but usefull.",4
18923,Assignments should have been mentioned in details.,4
18924,"Interesting to acquire basics of TableauThen a lot of fundamental features are missing like interaction, Level Of Details, and so on",4
18925,"Cool tools with knowledgeable instructor, thumbs up.",4
18926,"Exercises were good, but the actual teaching of technique felt somewhat lacking. In a way, the instructors actually cover a lot of ground over a short period of time, but on the other hand, there are certain areas that I wish they would have covered more in depth in order to be equipped to complete the homework.For example: the Week 2 HW on Shipment status did not specify the criteria for early/late/on-time, so I ended up making a parameter for the user to vary it; however, parameters are not covered in this course. Also, for the same homework, there wasn't enough explanation of how to get weeks to be listed starting with a particular day, which made it difficult to replicate exactly what the homework sample is supposed to look like.",4
18929,"Overall the course content and quality is good and the lectures are pretty good and highly informative, but the course content need to be highly practical oriented and geared towards meeting the real-time needs of digital marketing professionals.",4
18936,"Excellent course, the only advice is it takes 10-12 hrs per week, plan accordingly.",4
18952,"There were parts where the lack of context felt worse than others. In general, it was OK but I think with the years it will improve.",4
18956,"Overall, it was an interesting course that touched upon various learning/teaching strategies. The course is relevant in the present times of digital transformation sweeping the globe. As responsible citizens, we need to keep reinventing the wheel when it comes our learning and teaching mindset. In this respect, this course has been a catalyst to nudge us to think and expand our cognitive horizons. Thank you!",4
18959,"Thanks for this great course! It was very interesting and informative, and I learned a lot about e-learning.",4
18993,It is quite helpful for everyone but for professionals it is superficial and I wanted it to be more explanatory with examples.,4
18994,This course is insightful into potential careers with dentistry and helpful in gaining an understanding of teeth and dental practices. As a Qualified Equine Dental Technician I can also recommend this course to any Veterinarians and para professionals wanting to further their knowledge in the world of Dentistry.,4
19007,"I think it's a interesting course because in my opinion, nowadays Human Rights are one of the most important things to protect people in this capitalist word.",4
19024,"You can find your object in this course, but this course is too platitude to make me feel boring...",4
19025,please i need a pass certificate,4
19031,"The course could be structured a little bit better and some topics should have been discussed in greater detail. But in general, I really enjoyed the course and found the two instructors very likable.",4
19032,"Very interesting course and most video's are fun to watch.Only the video's with a lot of interviews or where they switch all the time between skype conversations I sometimes find a bit boring, or I think the duration is too long.",4
19033,Too many peer-viewed assignment,4
19034,"My feeling is that this MOOC is very inspiring in way that it brings out the fact and paradox that we previously were reluctant to say out , and that is we are not saving lives in an effective way and that's how we actually should behave if we are real egalitarians in ourselves. And it also provides us with simple tools to make analysis by ourselves.Space for improvement could lie in that the links between videos and reading materials of a same module or block could be strong, at least sometimes they don't seem so hooked with each other to me or I sometimes got confused what these contents together show something different from other blocks.",4
19035,"The content of the course was really interesting and made me think about things I didn't think of before. However, I found the layout of this course really confusing. It would be better if there was no division per week, but just a list of mandatory things and a list of optional things.",4
19036,Engaging instructors and very interesting content. This course is unique because you can apply what you learn in the real world.,4
19045,Fascinating subject where informatics and biology come together . By taking these courses you get a deep understanding of how research results are obtained by multidisciplinary teams.,4
19050,It may be more helpful to students who are not taking the honors code if they had access to ready made programming codes to complete the stepik exercises as it is extremely taxing and not feasible to solve all problems by hand.Brilliantly structured and very effective learning method!I also felt that Gibbs sampling could have been explained further or more in detail.Thank you!,4
19053,"This is certainly not a course for beginners! The content of the course were rather complex and prior computer science knowledge is extremely helpful to finish this course. It was a struggle for me to finish this course without any background in computer science. However, it was definitely challenging and gave me an insight on how two different disciplines can be connected in a single field of study. The only improvement I could think of is if there were videos regarding the basic computer science knowledge that could have helped biologists such as myself. Perhaps giving an example on how things are done could be useful. There were only a handful of examples and the examples only gave the answers but did not explain how to get that answer well enough.",4
19066,Very well explained for both biologists and computer scientists.,4
19069,"Very nice course and information, but backend could be more polished. Many tasks (expecially about randomized algorithms) could fail even if you do 100% right. And very little debug information provided.",4
19078,"Very good material. Needs more users participating to be perfect, but it's a very good course, with contents in Spanish. (Plenty of similar courses with English content so it's perfect).",4
19079,"Nothing special, thanks for the information.",4
19081,"The Course was great, except for two things. one it was too short :-), and two, the peer graded projects were confusing.",4
19084,Brilliant framework and well designed structure,4
19090,"very fun introduction course. it doesn't take much time. however we don't go much in depth, just the concepts are given. The strategy to win at Nim is given as well, but no proof of it, not even as an extra, which is a bit disappointing because it was kind of being the highlight of the course. i guess we have to think by ourselves to understand why it works (or google it...)i was surprised to discover symbols such as up, down, star, ... and all those surreal numbers... the last lecture leaves us wanting more but alas the course is too short",4
19094,A good introduction to games without chance.,4
19096,"The course topic itself and the syllabus was interesting and magnetic especially for someone like me who is equally interested in Economics, Game Theory, Mathematics and Computer Science. But I do feel that the concepts can be dealt with more theoretically so as to build formal background. I know it is difficult to make it mathematically heavy but still some of the concepts should have a theoretical explanation and proofs.Overall, course was good and I learnt a lot of new things.",4
19101,"It's a fine course which enables you to learn some interesting things about simple games and a branch of mathematics most people are unaccustomed with. It doesn't need much previous knowledge, although a decent level of mathematics and mathematical logic is very helpful especially when it comes to understanding new terms and definitions. The professor helps you with simple examples when something seeming difficult to get comes up, but beware his weird sense of humor! Enjoy the course!",4
19102,A nice introduction to the topic. Suitable for a beginner.,4
19104,"This is an excellent course, I enjoyed full content about the every topics and some topics I improve along the course. Thank you, I recommend this course.",4
19113,I've enjoyed a lot this challenging course. To get a 10 in all the assignments is very hard. But 7 is achievable.,4
19123,"Good Introduction to Embedded Systems and operating systems, discuss interesting topics and the architecture of OS, a little hard and challenging but it worth it.",4
19127,IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND KNOWS ALL FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT AND IDEAS,4
19130,"Instructor is very good.His explanation about CONTIKI is simple super.Course Structure is very good.But,in my opinion require little bit elaborated explanation about ASSIGNMENT.Rather than everything is fine.Thanks to COURSERA.",4
19134,"It's a nice course, but there are also a lot of things that need improve! Thank you,teacher!",4
19135,"Good introduction to embedded systems development with ""OS"". but it needs to include better & more code examples",4
19141,"Difficult subject to get your head around but ultimately worth the effort. The teaching, as always with the University of Alberta's MOOCs, is second to none.",4
19143,"The presenter is world class, and I really enjoyed the interactive maps. The quizzes should be a bit more challenging though - perhaps learn how to identify a few fossils,",4
19147,"The professor could have been a bit more serious, he acted as if he was a kindergarden teacher. Seriously: do you really need to imitate with your hand how a fish swims? I don't think so.Also, the pronounciation of the latin words was horrible - then again, all native English speakers have problems with it, so don't take this remark personally.",4
19153,"Although not as strong as the other palaeontology courses by the University of Alberta, the current courses takes much the same approach and uses the same teaching techniques as these other courses. As such, it easily and effectively gets the millions of years of early vertebrate evolution across clearly and concisely. The video lectures are both interactive and fun, and the course notes are both informative and well adjusted to the video lectures. If there is anything to be remarked upon, then it's the slight lack of depth as pertains to the material covered. This, however, is hardly surprising considering the highly complex material (drawing from fields as osteology, paleoecology, evolutionary and developmental biology, palaeontology and more), the speed at which it is discussed, and the level of accessibility that is provided. Overall, a very good course, and one I very much enjoyed following!",4
19161,"I have learned so much from this course, thanks to Coursera and University of Alberta. This course is highly recommended for students with a passion for Evolution and Phylogeny. The handouts are also very useful.",4
19169,Very interesting and entertaining!,4
19177,"i like this. this is good. good can be fun. fun has rewards...yay, i win",4
19185,"Very interesting and compelling course, and I liked the questions every few minutes during the lectures as that helps me to retain information.My only complaint is that the lecturer's manner of speaking is very rhythmic and repetitive and that makes it kind of hard to lose track of his words.",4
19191,"Contains all basic information on data descriptors, presented in a thorough and easy to understand way. More practice exercises (quizzes) would make it even better.",4
19195,"It was a clear explanation to the statistical, and the examples are",4
19216,"really helpful, but also tough",4
19228,"First of all: Thank you very much for providing this, I've learned a lot!Why not 5 stars?In some cases you just used a link to Wikipedia as additional material for a video. In the first and second week you had more details, I know you already kindly invested a lot of time, but I would appreciate if you could add some details to those sections where you just used links.",4
19235,Very interesting!,4
19238,"I am absolutely delighted to have had the opportunity to study the fundamentals of music theory from a prestigious university such as The University of Edinburgh for free online. I extend my most sincere gratitude to Coursera and the professors teaching the course for making this possible. The course makes it very easy to build knowledge going from week to week. The assignments are all challenging. In this way this course encourages studying to understand the concepts. I have attended the course as a beginner in music theory, having encountered only some very elementary concepts earlier. I have found all the teachers to be very pleasant and very clear in their explanations. I have given 4 stars to this course because I would have liked to learn more from the professors on some topics which were very briefly mentioned. Some of the courses have external links to Wikipedia instead of a more clear explanation. This are however the exception and not the rule. The majority of the course is well taught and presented.",4
19239,"At the beginning, I thought the course was very good for beginners or people that know how to play an instrument well but would like to know more about the theoretical background.However, the last two sessions were very hard and there could have been more detailed course material throughout the course and more exercises to make sure the concepts are well-understood by all students.Nevertheless, the course proved to be very useful and enabled me to analyse a musical piece, which made it worthwhile.",4
19248,"I think it is a really good course, unfortunately too advanced for someone that is just starting to play the recorder and recognises the notes and so on. Also the fact that the notes are ABCDEFG instead of DO.RE.MI.FA... made thinks a little bit confusing for me. I learnt some stuff until 3rd week where started to be quite complicated, 4th week was frustrating. Maybe in the future I'll come back to it.",4
19254,"This was a great class, but some of the information could have been more comprehensive, and some of the questions on the tests did not match the information from the lectures.",4
19255,"Good for beginners, introduced basic theory systemly. But a few mistakes appeared, though corrected in the videos too, but better to clear them in the future shifts.",4
19261,"Challenging at times, but doable with effort, and quite rewarding upon success. Recommended.",4
19262,"A little bit steep demand curve regarding to what is offered in the lectures.Well, well... The whole world knows that ""they"" are a little ""thrifty"" ;-)",4
19263,Very informative course. Teaches all the fundamentals till they're painfully obvious. It has helped me understand the skeletal structure of the music I listen to and has helped answer many questions. Thank you.,4
19264,"Generally this course has good subjects and syllabus. In some parts of course they teach reasons of the subjects and it becomes more logical for me. The only reason that I gave four stars is lecture videos are not enough for the final exam. Especially for part 2 of final exam, some questions are more detailed for given lectures. However, it was a good introduction for music theory.",4
19268,Great introduction to music theory. In some sections the layout of the course could be somewhat better.,4
19269,Very interesting course: I'm a Computer Engineer and I found very interesting the lessons about bistability and about stochastic modelling.,4
19279,it's quite very interesting,4
19283,"Very informative course with good exercises. Would recommend having PDE example code, as well.",4
19284,"Firstly Peter Clarke, what a legend!! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2. I owe you a virtual beer.One change would be to make the forums the same format as course 1-3 as this was a much more efficient way to review issues.Over all the material was good, I stuck at it even when I wanted to quit and feel knowledgeable now on the lesson taught.",4
19287,"This course is almost the final one for the specialization taught by prof Kaul. It is a little redundant with the 3rd course of the specialization. However, it is still of great quality, format and content, as the other courses were.It allows you to apply courses 1-3 in close to real life contexts. The exams are very interesting, and module 4 of this course made me want to go further into valuation problems. I encourage to take courses 1, 2 and 3 before this one.",4
19293,An excellent course on Valuing a company and understanding the same with the help of assignments.,4
19300,"Nice course, good intro. Pretty thin but helpful and good value for money.",4
19313,This course was a good use of time for me as I didn’t have much back ground in music theory.I now know how to construct a major and minor scale with any root. I’m also able to use those scales to build a number of chords to help guide improvisation.I found the ear training exercises to be a fun way to develop my musical awareness. I found them a little annoying because when I would go back to try them again my answers from the day before were still there.,4
19322,Cannot do the test without pay...,4
19330,"This course whet my appetite for some more Berklee courses. Definitely recommended to musicians who would love to improve their craft. Thanks, Coursera and Berklee!",4
19342,Learned the trend of latest Pharma industry and review the basic concepts in drug discovery,4
19359,Very Good !!,4
19369,The lessons were pretty good and definitely focused on teaching. The assignment though was by far my favorite part. I think I might continue to do my own research on local geologic features just because of how much fun I had doing it for the class.,4
19376,"so far i have completed week 1 course its quite interesting, and feel like reading a research thesis",4
19382,Great course until now.,4
19388,"Good course. Challenging, detailed and academic. Suitable for people with basic grasp of human biology, in particular metabolic functions, as well as research methods.",4
19396,i really enjoyed this course. We should be more carefully with the food we eat ad its quality.Thanks for this great course.,4
19399,Well organized course,4
19428,"I WOULD LIKE MORE COURSES LIKE THIS, A LOT OF INFORMATION AND GOOD TEACHERS",4
19444,The course was very helpful,4
19446,Good course,4
19447,Well designed course to understand basic concepts and execute in project.,4
19454,Thank you for amazing knowledge,4
19457,Enjoyed learning about the Rate to Ratio and Cumulative Distribution fuctions,4
19460,Thank you for this well prepared and presented course.the assignment were very useful to test and validate our understanding of the course materials. I also liked the opening question and the answer at the end.,4
19464,Good course for improving working with SQL in Data Warehouses,4
19471,Presenters with deep multiple layers of experience and confidence in their value. Clarity of highlighting specific points for presentations of this length. Obvious each person could spend days speaking about these topics. Thank you.,4
19479,"I didn't like the assignment; it did not make me think of the taught theory, or teach me any kind of practical skill. However, the rest of the course was good.",4
19490,"Really a great course, with focus on the concepts and mathematics of image processing . More academic type course rather than a hands on one. Less weight given to video processing. I wish there was a bit more programming and practical assignments to accompany this compendium of DSP knowledge .Thanks alot!",4
19491,"Good course, could have provided more examples and more elaboration regarding the fourier transform. Good instructor who is knowledgeable about this field. Might be better to introduce tutorials that go through selected problems step by step. Thanks very much and all the best.",4
19495,"Well worth the time. Topics are clearly explained most of the time. I was getting a bit lost in the math towards the very end (last couple of weeks), but even though details were hazy, I think the general concept was conveyed well. The labs could be a bit more insightful for a few of the weeks but were overall good.",4
19500,Very good course.,4
19502,"Good course, I only recommend to incorporate mini projects per week, ...Thankyou",4
19507,"I cannot understand what the teacher says because of the accent, in the first time I thought it's not a problem but actually I was.",4
19510,"The Course is very informative and definitely a good basic course to image and video processing. However, I felt that linking the course modules with python snippets for examples will help the people who work in the related fieds. Thank you.",4
19515,Quite a good course. I just wished a free programming language being used in place of Matlab.,4
19519,"I think the teacher should speak more clearly, he has a strong accent, however, the materials and contents in this lessons are pretty good.",4
19521,"Very good overview of theory, specific algorithms, and some practice of application in MATLAB. There's a lot of material to cover and the videos are longer, requiring self-pacing throughout the individual lectures. Some of the weeks are very challenging. Extracurricular study, practice and implementation helped in areas where I had yet to encounter supporting material and/or prerequisites.",4
19522,Excellent but need more challenging questions both in theory and programming part.,4
19524,"This is an excellent course to get to understand the principles of image and video processing. However, this is not a course to take lightl. If your goal is to learn, you'll spend AT LEAST 5-7 hours/week (especially between weeks 5-9) if you want to get all the juice out of it.",4
19526,Good course!,4
19534,"Quite allright for an introductory course to image processing! But to really understand the course, one needs to have experience in basic DSP and statistics. Otherwise, many of material won't be as clear.",4
19536,It covers all the fundamental knowledge of digital image and video processing,4
19537,"that is awesome course . but , there is not any support from staffs (for example in answering in discussion )",4
19538,"it's a good material and nice professor, but sometimes the material is rather theoretical. Some lessons are very heavy with details and very basic practice excercises. I was missing deeper excercises that cover more of the studied material",4
19561,This course provides a good overview of the topic.,4
19592,"It was very helpful to take this course as it gave me an insight to understand and look closely at the indications which will guide me in the future to deal with children who are normally labelled as 'slow', 'not focused', 'has lack of concentration' etc. The course gives a detailed understanding towards the psychological aspects and directs teachers to engage and encourage such children.I sure feel more equipped to handle such scenarios in the future. Would appreciate if more videos of real classroom training can be added! All the best!",4
19595,"I did this course as a parent of a dyslexic child. I thought it was brilliant and I made pages and pages of notes. It is well organised, engaging, and informative. I really liked the two presenters as well. They both seemed passionate about the topic and modeled good teaching in their explanations and advice. That said, I thought the assessment part of the course simply didn't work. It was far too narrow for anyone besides primary teachers and therefore excluded those who might be doing the course for other reasons. It doesn't matter to me, I don't need the certificate and I got a lot out of the course but for others it would be frustrating, I imagine. The quizzes too, for the most part, were a disaster. They were poorly written, confusing, and dishearteningly obscure. Otherwise, I loved this course and hope you will offer a follow up soon.",4
19608,This course has been really helpful in forming my views in many arena especially dyslexia of course.a Big Thank You for reforming my views.,4
19614,This course gave me a great insight into how the mind of my dyslexic son works and good hints to help him succeed in the classroom.,4
19617,"This is a very nice overview of the research behind dyslexia. I would have liked additional teaching suggestions, rather than having the class be primarily about research and screening.",4
19620,"A very very helpful course that gives practical solutions in a classroom and school-wide setting. It was structured well and easy to follow. If I had one comment, it would be that some of the quizzes did not line up with the course so well (you had to study ahead to answer questions). Other than this, really worth the amount of time spent studying!",4
19628,"It's interesting,,,",4
19629,In my view this course is well structured and it focuses on business topics. I highly recomend do it. I'm an spanish native speaker and in my opinion with B1/B2 level you can follow it without any problem,4
19631,Very well explained and easy to follow.Learnt a lot from this course,4
19632,Thank you,4
19643,the outline of this program seems good,4
19646,"The methodology taught was awesome. I, being an Indian benefited a lot, truly. It was another platform to interact globally.",4
19648,"I really enjoyed this course. Be prepared though that some of the assignments take substantial time to prepare, interviewing others. Don't just assume that each 'week' in the course plan will take you a week to complete. It would be useful to have a bit of warning up front in the course overview about which weeks have assignments that require more time.",4
19663,"Great theoretical approach to obtain leadership skills is described here, though a little bit more visualized info (those academic case studies in PDF are really difficult for comrehension) could make this course much more effective in terms of knowledge acquisition and accessible for wider audience",4
19671,"I enjoyed this course and thought the material was interesting and well-presented. I gave it four stars instead of 5 partly because so many of the exercises were geared to people who were in a traditional work environment and since I am currently in transition and trying to figure out my next career move, the exercises were not as readily applicable to me. I did all of them and tried to make them relevant to where I am in my life. I plan to continue with this series so I hope the remaining 3 courses are somewhat adaptable to my situation as well. I did think the instructor of this course seemed to have a real passion and joy for the subject and for life in general, so he was a good ambassador for the message of the course. Thank you! Feby Shen",4
19674,Outstanding Course..,4
19685,Amazing track and outstanding facilitator,4
19688,Great Framework. Love to see more interview videos of people sharing their experiences of using the framework in their lives.,4
19699,I very much enjoyed this course. However the tests at the end of each week were not always absolute answers. In many cases several answers could be considered as corect depending on political views.,4
19701,A must do course for beginners who are interested to understand the underlying considerations behind formulating economic and redistribution policies of countries.,4
19708,"Great, thanks",4
19710,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was very informative. I would like to see more up-to-date data incorporated (I did this course in 2017 and the data used was current to 2013). The videos were clear and easy to follow and understand and the recommended reading materials were appropriate to the subject areas.,4
19711,Good beginner course. A bit easy at times but informative and well taught.,4
19712,Very informative course.,4
19716,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot about the energy industry and issues facing the US based on energy resources. I have taken another course that involved writing reports, rather than just quizzes. I think that a more in-depth assessment for the course might improve it slightly.",4
19720,It was a good course in spite the fact that it was all about the situation of energy in us.Very goodTHanks,4
19725,A good introductory course which provides a general overview of the the US Energy System. The delivery is clear and succinct.Could be expanded to cover the global energy system.,4
19726,Good introductory course on energy. The data shown is 3 years old (2012-2013) but the trend analysis presented holds good for a long time. Professor is very practical minded. I gave it a 4 star because more coverage required on Nuclear Power.,4
19728,"Very good course and complete... Best Regards,",4
19732,"Under the time constraint, its a good summary!",4
19740,"A short course providing the big picture of US energy. I enjoyed taking the course as it provided background information in all the main fields - technology, physics and economics. The course would be even more enjoyable if it concentrated less on US and more on the world at large.",4
19743,it is an excellent course for beginners.,4
19747,"Good course, but be aware of the 101 part. One of the minuses is that a lot of information provided in the course is about US (to be honest i expected more world related data) and the professor is not that emotional / interesting (sometimes monotoneous).",4
19753,"Great class. At times I was lost, when he talked about alternative",4
19757,"Very practical.Sam, the lecturer is a likeable chap.",4
19761,"Covers a lot of ground, but the quizzes don't always line up with the material, the prof speaks painfully slow (needed to speed it up) and the info is getting dated.",4
19767,great information,4
19770,"Got good understanding about energy demand, supply and its independence.Good content and lecture.",4
19774,"It is an exciting course available to us; It opens our mind about how difficult it is to change energy resources to renewable ones. I feel enthusiast, we will achieve together our goal .... a better world for everyone not only US population?! but all world population.",4
19775,is not just a survey about energy and sustainabilityExcellent course!,4
19783,"Interesting and useful, with an accent on the practical exercises. It will test your Python programming skills, with application on the stock analysis and trading back-testing.",4
19793,"An excellent introduction to the subject for the computing professional. I learned enough basic concepts of investing and fund management to be able to navigate about the literature and I got some good practice in Python, in particular Pandas. I got my hands dirty and now I think that I can throw a passable trading system and this is what I wanted from the course. It is only to be hoped that Part II of the series will be offered sometime in the future or that at least a reading list for this course would be made available.",4
19799,good course but course material was too easy ... it should be more rigorous,4
19803,"I give this 4 out of 5 stars mostly due to some technical video/audio issues with the material and its presentation and editing. Also, there didn't seem to be anyone moderating and only a few other people taking the class so not enough forum discussions to help us out. Additionally, I'm also disappointed there isn't a part II that continues into ML approaches to the subject. Finally, I think a bit more rigor and theory could be introduced into the videos before just pointing to the accompanying textbooks. But I understand the tradeoffs. Looking forward to part II (please Dr. Balch!)",4
19811,"Very interesting course, especially the homeworks on python. I learned a lot from these homeworks in programming with python. The only inconvenience was the software QSTK w",4
19812,I wish the course covered machine learning. Looking forward for part II,4
19819,course is pretty good and everything is very simply explained but i gave 4 stars only because many things was repeated so many times that it was sometimes soo boring and i thought we will compute in python more.,4
19822,highly recommanded,4
19825,"I enjoyed this course. The content was good and the assignments challenging. The presenter was OK but he seemed a little unprepared at times. I think the course is a little dated in that the strategies taught simply don't work anymore, but as an introduction to some techniques and considerations for technical analysis then I recommend it.I also recommend that anyone considering this course without a strong python background takes some time to learn how to use Pandas - it will make your life much easier!",4
19826,Good introductory course.,4
19829,It provide a basic framework for stock investment analyze,4
19836,Easy to understand. Homework is somewhat challenging and the contents are very useful for novice.,4
19852,"Very good course in entrepreneurship, giving good theoretical and practical insights at the same time!",4
19861,"Overall, good information that is very helpful for making the transition into the HR field. I wish the lecturer didn't trip over his own words all the time - it made it hard to listen to the video's.",4
19862,great course,4
19867,"Great lectures from Larry bourgerie! I really enjoyed the course, though had some difficult time with the peer graded assignment.",4
19874,Great faculty and course content,4
19875,Really enjoyed the course! Nice overview of performance management.,4
19887,"Superb instruction, great that there are optional levels of problem-solving (i.e., for those wanting only a review of the topic, you can do just the worksheet problems and skip practice problems). Still, the ""none of the above"" options on quizzes with numerical answers is something I would reconsider.",4
19896,"I really wanna thank Dr. Wayne for his efforts in this course, it really refreshed my Knowledge and add new skills, Great work",4
19899,"I am not really happy with the quality of the course, but the courses from Dr. Whiteman are the only mechanical engineering courses available on Coursera. And it seems that Dr. Whiteman is very enthusiastic, so I am grateful for his efforts. Well done!",4
19904,Very well explained.,4
19905,"Great review of various aspects of mechanical engineering, a ""must"" for any engineer",4
19926,Very good teaching skills by both professors and interesting guest lectures and tutorials. Assignements that demand your full attention. I would like some more depth as far as the developement of programming skills and the practice. Great intuition and explanation.,4
19930,interesting instructor and interesting content. Now I know more about the theoretical research related to neuro function and its connection to machine learning now.,4
19931,"This course serves as a nice introduction to the field of computational neuroscience. However, at some points, more than basic knowledge of differential equations and probability & statistics is needed.",4
19933,Great course and really helpful for me.,4
19935,"I very much enjoyed the course overall. Lectures from week 2 to week 5 were a little bit tedious in my opinion, not because of the content, but due to the way the lecture was presented. I suggest that by the end of the course, one could see the correct answers (with explanation) of the quizzes, since that would help learning. I enjoyed the course and I learned a lot. I thank the coursera staff and the UW faculty who made this possible.",4
19945,"This is a very interesting course that provides many interesting ideas. At the same time it is quite challenging. Solid background in probability theory, linear algebra and signal processing is needed. Considering it ""Introductory"" level is misleading.",4
19946,"Learnt concepts about Neural Networks, Supervised / Unsupervised / Reinforcement Learning. Covers topics about Information Theory, Statistic and Probability. Matlab / Python assignments.",4
19947,"In general very good, but some concepts are rushed over due to the short length of the course.",4
19953,"This course is perfect for gaining a broad perspective on global energy markets. It also delivers useful tools for analyzing political issues, strategic business decisions, and energy markets.",4
19961,"The material is very useful because a multidisciplinary approach was adopted in its delivery. Although I was not too comfortable with the references that was severally made to the US economy, but I guess this was influenced by the professors background. However, the last project paid off for this.",4
19963,"Very interesting crash course in business development, coupled with energy issues and technologies. Suitable for beginners in business development strategies and concepts.",4
19966,Very braod and enhanced look and description about global energy issues and its branches.,4
19973,"Very interesting overview of the energy business. I would encourage Michael Orlando to release other more specialized courses on hot topics such as the levelized cost of generation resources, electricity or natural gas market dynamics,...I would thank you Michael Orlando for his time and effort to make this course available to all of those interested in energy matters.Antonio",4
19974,Very informative course!,4
19975,Very well structured course with a good introduction of thinking about the world energy business. Videos are very crisp and development of the course from broad base info of energy options to the strategy tools involved in making energy decisions is very well thought out.,4
19978,"generally satisfied with the course content and its execution. Gives a brief, but very qualitative, overview on the issue. Sadly as a citizen of EU, some of the course materials are focused more on the US economy/energy systems, which for me would be much more interesting to see these information about EU. But it is logical, as it is provided by an US institution.Overall I only can recommend to any newcomers to the global energy business or who want to get a little bit deeper knowledge about the issue.",4
19980,Covered a great deal of ground in a short period of time. Heavy economics.,4
19981,An eye opener and a very intuitive Course I must say!,4
19982,I did it twice. One of the best. Very recomendable.,4
19988,Great course for an introductory knowledge of the energy business!,4
19998,"Good material. The notes or transcripts were rather poorly done, making for a lot of editing to get the supplied text to a usable form. More interviews with outside experts would have been welcome. Case studies were informative and useful.",4
20005,Highly useful lectures.The classes can be more effective by active participation of more students simultaneously. A brief insight into derivation of some basic concepts and introduction to fundamental difference between different kinds of members used in engineering applications can be added.Thanks for the lectures !Practical demonstration of the problems provides a better clarity.,4
20014,Its very informative for the fresh studentscourse content is explained very clearly.,4
20025,"This is a reasonable course, I definitely learned some stuff about mechanics. Things were generally explained well, though there were some things that could have been explained better. The quizzes were very simplistic (the type of multiple-choice questions where you often don't have to actually be able to do the calculations to figure out the answer, you can just look at the options and rule out all but the right one).",4
20028,Decent start to Engineering,4
20030,"Strict re-quiz structure and odious ""None of the above"" options, but superb instruction.",4
20036,"It is a good course, however it is less demanding that the one I had in the second year of my engineering education in the 1950s.",4
20038,Application based teaching.,4
20040,"very good learnt a lot but , a small suggestion is that please work out even more problems it helps us strengthen concepts . Thank you",4
20055,"It is a good online courses. I like the way Mr. Whitney present to us, he is using a tools to show us the phenomenon. Overall I like this course!",4
20060,"it was a great thing to refresh my knowledge and remember a lot of ways i had forget, thanks Dr.Wayne a lot, hope you the best",4
20064,Feedback: Great course! Only request is that the homework solutions be provided. Thanks.,4
20086,simply and easily to understand.,4
20089,"Great course, I like short videos where concepts are well explained and the quizzes are not tiresome at all but I consider than the pdf of the power point documents could be better, the complete solution does not appear in most of them",4
20091,"Good introduction, excellent instructor.",4
20094,"Good overview of engineering statics. However, I wish the homework and/or practice problems were built into the coursera platform like the quizzes.",4
20100,I finished the course and I think the course is a great first view of what engineering mechanics can offer to the students at the university. I am a mechanical engineer newly graduated at UFRGS and the course was a great experience to recall some of the content learned at the university.,4
20104,"Wayne comes across as very enthusiastic and likable. The course material is interesting.It does feel like the course if artificially stretched out a bit too long, though. The material and exercises seem to get repetitive after week 3, when the pattern has been established to sum up all forces, and then to sum up all cross-products.Nevertheless, this is an introductory course, so too much depth can not be expected. As an introduction, it was a great experience.",4
20105,"4.5, Not perfect, but very clear and consistent (I'm only in week 2 and this is my first coursera course) there are some topics that I feel need a little more clarification, but that is my only complaint. Perhaps it would be a good idea for the site to have a FAQ for each individual course. The Professor or course instructor, could answer these questions for future course sessions. Perhaps there's a reason this idea wouldn't work, but it would be nice to see from the student's perspective.",4
20106,"Great introduction to engineering processes. I was hoping, however, to gain a bit more insight on general details of structures and mechanics, such as what types of materials or designs should be used in certain situations and why. This course covered only mathematics, which while essential, are not the only aspect of engineering in real life applications.",4
20108,its a very usefull course,4
20110,"Besides those interested engineering, those interested in learning how stuff works will love this course. I have been studying calculus and was bored with math problems that do not have real world application. This course provided those applications in spades, although at a beginning level in mechanical engineering. If you love math and love solving problems, this course is a great place to do it.",4
20111,"Hard work but very well explained, lots of exercises and good content from a great university.",4
20113,"Ideal for Highschool students/graduates who want to pursue further higher educational engineering subjects. A little bit challenging, yet entertaining, and worthy of participating in. Good luck for all!!",4
20116,Good & useful course but with some errors.,4
20118,"Very good course, even better if the homework exercises would be provided with the possibility to check your own answers.",4
20122,"I liked everything about this course except the unavailability of answers to the quiz questions. I think that once when someone passes the test, he/she should be able to view the answers.",4
20128,"A bit fast paced, while the book is too long. I need something in between. :)",4
20137,The level of this course is high. It's better to take a basic course on Econometrics and then take up this.,4
20140,"Some topics that were covered in this course were not explained in details and, in addition, there was no explanation of the theoretical aspects of the course (for instance, formulas transcript ).",4
20143,Lecture materials are very rich and well organized.,4
20152,many mistakes in the exercise solutions,4
20153,"Generally speaking , I have to say that it is good course , I learned many things. More explanation should be provided for some concepts.",4
20154,"Very interesting intermediate course in Econometrics. I strongly recommend for both new learners and those are interested in refreshing their knowledge in econometrics.Maybe some blocks are too theoretical, there are some ""bugs"" in the content, and I miss a bit more of applied econometrics using statistical softwares.Definetly a very good example of teaching econometrics through MOOC, my heartfelt congratulations to the Econometrics team of the Erasmus University for the great job, it has been a really valuable course to attend.",4
20156,"It is a good course, but a bit short in my opinion",4
20161,"Good information, and detailed mathematical representation of the concepts, but often you will have to do outside research to truly understand the material, and the building blocks are not very helpful beyond a basic refresher course on matrices and statistics. This class requires a lot of studying and initiative to seek outside help to understand the material.If more time was dedicated to truly explaining the concepts and principles and the REASONING behind them instead of just supplying equations and test names, this class would get a 5 star rating.",4
20171,"This course is not for someone who hasn't taken much advanced math. There's a strong requirement of linear algebra, calculus, and probability. Someone who is relying only on the math prep they give you in the course will likely be very under-prepared for some of the more theoretical homework assignments.With that disclaimer out of the way, this course gives a fairly good overview of important econometric techniques, though I wish they would have done more with time series analysis.A major shortcoming of this course is some of the more complicated material (RESET test, Chow test, endogeneity, etc) were not presented in a complete way (in my opinion). I found myself referring to quite a few outside sources in order to figure out some of the more complicated material. Keep this in mind when taking the class and give yourself extra time to read farther into the concepts discussed in class.",4
20177,"Good content and exercise, very pedagogic.The only problem are the use of the program: If you don't know how to use a statistical program such as R, you will spend more time struggling with the program than understanding the topic.",4
20183,"It is a very good course I guess, but being 15 years old, it didn't make any sense.However, I got to learn a lot of new things about a field which I wish to pursue.",4
20187,"Awesome, helped me alot! Thanks MOOC cordinatiors.",4
20195,"More focus should be given on application part in initial modules vs. derivation. Also, the presentation can be made a bit more simple to understand.",4
20204,nicely explained.,4
20210,"Very good course. But too much emphasis on statistical derivations. Also estimating models by using any statistical software (SPSS, STATA, R, Eviews) will for sure be an interesting ad on.",4
20218,The course is very interesting but the translation was very bad.,4
20221,"The course content is excellent, however the English transcript is very poorly done and there are words and sentences are either missing or translated/ transliterated wrongly. A native English language speaker would be great.",4
20222,Very Interesting! I would extend the part on the biological passport and give more details on how the adaptive model algorithm works.,4
20225,Very informative. This is obviously [now] an incredibly complicated and important issue.My personal preference would to have a bit more science science and a little less social science among the topics.,4
20229,Thanks for the course. I've learned a lot and will share my experiences to my friends :),4
20231,"Really enjoyable! A lot of information clearly unified and in consideration of different points of view. A little bit hard for the accent at the beginning, but fastly overcome.",4
20233,This was a very interesting course. It presented a new way of looking at emotions I had not thought of before and the lectures were fun and interesting. The quizzes could have been a bit more challenging. Excellent forum participation from the mentors/staff.,4
20249,Not too much material in addition to the Types of Conflict course but worth reading,4
20253,very interesting learning experience,4
20256,The visuals and practical examples are very useful as they can even permeate even the very uneducated with understanding.,4
20260,"A good course! The assignments were fun to write. Some videos were redundant, but overall I enjoyed it greatly.",4
20263,"It's an excellent course from University of California, Irvine.I would appreciate the course curriculum designers and faculty who have delivered the course through examples and case studies.Looking forward for the more informative courses like this.Regards,Hemendar PusaProfessional Social worker and Special EducatorIndia",4
20264,"Too much theory, too little real life examples.",4
20269,This Course has a good and practical approach to conflict resolution in any a Organization.,4
20271,it is perfect course i take it until now thank you,4
20284,"I wish there was some more ""meat"" on actually resolving conflict, maybe it's in the next chapters :)",4
20285,this course really helped me a lot.,4
20286,Very interesting.,4
20289,"I do love the content of this course, however I do wish we saw more scenarios play out when trying to get a point across. This course is just harder to obtain for me memory wise.",4
20290,Using Mind Maps to explain can be a lot more easier!,4
20291,Great introduction into this subject.,4
20295,Tell the basic principles of conflict resolution. Reminds me of the summer course I took at Columbia University.,4
20296,Good Course,4
20297,"short and sweet. The course is quite short but covers the true essentials of conflict resolution in a professional environment. the only reason why I did not give five stars: the concept of Active Listening, although mentioned all over the course is not really well explained.",4
20301,Its great that Cour,4
20304,Excelent teacher!!,4
20307,Very Good.,4
20315,"Great content! This definitely challenges the mindset of what it takes to be a business owner or entrepreneur. One opportunity I see for the course is to better link the quiz language to what's taught in the videos and the articles, especially for the open ended questions. Those specific points can get lost in all of the ideas shared.",4
20318,"Good material, insightful thoughts about starting a business. However, course material could be better quality. Looking forward to the following courses.",4
20322,"Great course! Would have given it 5 stars , but this first course by itself is not much. I'm definitely going to check out the other courses in the specialization, as I'm pretty confident that as a whole it will be more complete.",4
20326,take the first step forward,4
20329,Very inspiring and powerful!,4
20332,Perfecto to start a change :),4
20334,"Clear, complete and helpfull",4
20341,Great course !,4
20352,"The course is very good. I have learned a lot of things from the theoretical and practical parts of the course. I like the mathematical derivations and the signal of the day. I wish you can give advanced course about adaptive filter design, advanced digital communications and audio processing. Thanks to the staff!",4
20360,good experience,4
20369,"The material was exceptional, but as I came to found out, that the assignments were watered down with respect to the earlier version of the course that was available in 2014. Please work to get back peer-reviewed assignments. Also, Prof. Hornstein's informal manner and way of teaching greatly helped in understanding the concepts. Thank you University of North Carolina and Prof. Hornstein for this wonderful primer on Environmental law.",4
20372,"Really informative and enlightening course! Prof Hornstein made the content easy to understand especially for those of us who don't have a law background. For anyone looking for some insight into environmental law, whether it's for your own general knowledge or if you want an idea of what studying environmental law entails, I'd definitely recommend it.",4
20378,"Enjoyed learning about the different statuates and policies as well as how to read them. From those not from US and fear that the stuff learnt may not be as relevant, don't fret! What's introduced are major policies that are important to the global community!",4
20384,I had a great time doing this course. Excellent content and great case studies.,4
20391,"Great course on the basics of environmental law an policy, very easy to follow and enganging for the audience. Still, would suggest to update some issues e.g. GHG as the Paris Agreement was ratified recently. But overall I would recommend for everyone interested in environmental issues as it was a great introduction.",4
20411,This course was well organized and highlighted the most influential environmental law cases in the US. It would be great if the course could be updated to reflect the recent COP21-Paris Agreement,4
20424,Very informative! Professor Hornstein makes the topics easy to understand & interesting despite little knowledge on environmental law.,4
20431,"A rewarding course. The professor's passion, energy and knowledge will enhance your learning experience on Environmental Law.",4
20436,I found the Course very informative and Excellent way of teachi,4
20441,"Instructor was very enthusiastic about the course, I thought it was well structured and it's good to get a framework for things. As someone who came in as pretty conservative leaning on the Environmental issue, it helps me become more knowledgeable about why the EPA can do the things it can, and a better understanding of how environmental law works. More information is always better!",4
20447,This course was well planned and dynamic. The professor extraordinary and presented all the topics in a way to make them even more interesting.,4
20466,"This is a very informative course that directly applies to many present-day environmental issues. If you're someone who has a passion for the environment and wants a better understanding of the underlying statutes framing these issues, take the course! It is heavily focused on United States law, but the basic concepts are universal.",4
20491,"I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to environmental law and policy. I especially enjoyed the structure of each lesson (reading -> video) and the entire course. I thought the Prof did a great job of being enthusiastic and was mostly clear when explaining, analyzing and discussing each case. Perhaps, an aspect that could be improved in the future is to ask more in-video question to challenge the student to think critically while watching the videos. However, where there is most room for improvement is to have much better management of the discussion section. There was no authority answering any questions whatsoever, not content related nor operational.",4
20502,"Thank you so much Prof for guiding us through a difficult yet an interesting topic. The course is well arranged in the way the choosen cases make it easier to understand the statutes, though it not that easy. I wish the course had brought in more international cases as the non-American students like me might be more intersted in.I love this course, as well as the T- shirts and the tux :)",4
20505,"the course was fantastic especially the 1 minute lawyer segments. Not sure if it is a site problem, problem with the course or with my machine but I frequently had times where the picture would freeze and audio would continue. The videos while informative were also quite long and it might have been a better idea to divide each 20 minute video into 2 smaller ones. Otherwise though it was a great course by a fantastic professor.",4
20507,the lawyer cum teacher rocks!!,4
20514,Thank you! easy class and very interesting,4
20516,Good practice,4
20518,better if to be more in depth!,4
20523,"Good content, but way too slow. Please use pdf instead of writing everything.",4
20525,Really interesting and useful course to obtain great insights of the Ecosystem Services approach.,4
20528,"I would advise anyone doing this specialization, to take the Java for Android first, then do the Engineering Maintainable Android apps, as its only in the Engineering Maintainable Android apps that there is an optional coursework to create and test a very simple app for the first time. All the other MOOCs optional courseworks start from very complex pre-existing app examples. I was able to complete these courseworks but I didnt really understand all the surrounding code that did a lot of important UI stuff, or the JUnit test. Its good to be forced to make a simple app and get used to JUnit from day 1. I did not take this route, but I wish I had.",4
20531,"Good information on unit and Android testing.Also provide some info on security issues.Could do with more hands-on assignments and provide URLs to Android testing, security, and debugging/code analysis tools. May be expand to include overview of code analysis tools like lint",4
20539,I want to give 4 stars because this course teaches you many concepts in a short time. In a very understandable way.,4
20541,there is too much about inside rule of US. I did not find that interesting or useful for me.,4
20546,"First of all, let me congratulate the team for starting this course on Epidemics, Pandemic and Outbreaks. It was a very nice and I could come to know about the epidemics which occurred throughout the Globe. I have a suggestion. I feel that this the course may be more detailed especially about the problems of developing countries like Malaria, Measles, etc., My sincere thanks to all my teachers. Please keep in touch",4
20547,"Short, but pretty good; very clear and concise lessons, understandable for beginners or intermediate learners.",4
20550,I hope there will be continuation of this course and expanding with examples.,4
20552,"An interesting course!Definitely glad I took this course. I was expecting a more medical approach, but it was interesting to see the legal issues as well. Sometimes hard to follow, and I think that might be due to my lack of knowledge on the l",4
20561,was searching for an online course in the field of public health and found this .....its a brilliant course and was worth it...............good job guys......thank,4
20562,It was interesting!,4
20564,informative,4
20573,There is lack of communication with peers and mentors. Its like styding alone,4
20574,"One or two of the assignments were very similar to assignments that were offered earlier in the specialization. Otherwise, the class was a great finale to a very well-done specialization!",4
20585,It's good and well done!but for Italian/European users is not so common to have an Eportfolio (Linkedin a part).,4
20601,This Course is have a comprehensive content for the current trends in technology. I am glad to be a part of this Course.,4
20609,Very good course,4
20612,"I learned a lot from this class, but I had a difficult time with some of the multiple choice quizzes, which I think could be improved. I felt that the additional materials (PDF readings) could have done a better job explaining concepts like risk ratios, rate ratios, and odds ratios, among others. I hope the teachers of the class consider revising and improving the lectures and readings for clarity.",4
20618,"An interesting introduction to epidemiology. I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained, and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles.However, from the course description, I expected the course to talk more about concepts (it covered this a little bit, e.g. the Bradford Hill criteria) and perhaps the state of modern-day epidemiology than it did (for example, studies and successes from within the last 10 years?). I would love to see a follow-up module on that topic!",4
20619,"Good course, very well structured, well signposted, progressive, very clear, with a good use of the media. As for the content, the examples are not always well connected to the theory. The speakers speak at a good pace, not too slow not too fast but their tone is monotonous and it is a little bit formal. Therefore the course is a little dull. As the course is very introductory, it would have been nice to be directed to other more advanced courses either online or residential.",4
20624,I loved it. The ladies did a great job :) Many thanks !,4
20625,"The course is great, but more practices would be better. In addition, the exams are too detailed to test one's ability.",4
20627,Thanks for the course. It was really helpful to review some of the topics in basic epidemiology. The course could be more better with better presentation and by sharing more basic information in a simple way.,4
20628,This course provided a brief overview and covered some statistics.,4
20629,"The course gives an overall good introduction to epidemiology applied to public health. The classes are well structured and the basic concepts are cleary explained, providing a more pratical insight on the uses and importance of clinical and epidemiological studies to public health. In my opinion, the course fill its purpose which is to give an basic introduction to epidemiology.However, considering its six weeks long duration, I think that it may be suitable to add facultative activities (videos or even supplemental material) to provide those who want to go deeper a more complete learning experience.",4
20632,"Fantastic course, Learnt allot",4
20635,"A great introductory course into the field of epidemiology covering all basic aspects of the field. The educators are very well organized and the work load per weak is very manageable. It is to be noted though that the exams can pose some difficulty in first two weeks as some may consider them to focus on trivia, other than that a great course.",4
20640,"Good overview of the subject, and easy to understand for someone with no health sciences background. My only complaint is that the additional readings were redundant, covering the exact same thing and using the same examples as the videos--I would prefer either different readings or making them more obviously optional.",4
20649,The course was enlightening. The module on measures of association was very clear and simple.,4
20653,"This course was excellent as a basic course, highlighting the most basic definitions and concepts that anyone interested in epidemiology without any background should and can understand.Thank you lecturers and organizers, this course definitely answered some questions I had after reading scientific articles.",4
20657,Great course. May be expanded a bit with more examples from both developed and developing countries. Thank you all very much for giving me the opportunity to learn from you all,4
20660,Succinct presentation of the information for a beginner. Highly recommended!,4
20666,"Good course, worth taking",4
20669,It's awesome. I am learning a lot. Thank you,4
20673,"it is the excellent course,and most helpfull to my profession",4
20674,Content was easy to follow and the tutors delivered material appropriately,4
20678,"it's an excellent introduction to epidemiology, with very clear explanations.",4
20679,very good first step to public health,4
20685,"I am really enjoying the course. It is really simple, informative and helpful.",4
20687,I have just started with the course and the introductory slides I found are perfectly designed. Thanks.,4
20689,This is a very good and very basic course of epidemiology.,4
20702,Helpful to get an overview of the field of epidemiology and what options epidemiologists have in the real world.,4
20708,An excellent introduction to epidemiology. The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I would have liked to see more statistics e.g. one or two statistical tests and maybe a prac on experimental/survey deisgn.,4
20710,"The course provides a good introduction to epidemiology. Both teachers are relaxed and speak very well, which is important for foreign students. I would add more intermediate ,practice exercises before quizzes, intermingling them with lectures. Absorbing too much material before the quiz is not always easy. Especially formulas should be practiced repeatedly with some real life problems, although not too difficult ones, in line with the purpose of the course.",4
20714,A great resource or as a reminder from previous material!!,4
20715,Basic concept of epidemiology.,4
20719,"Good course, tough, but good. Very engaging for those interested in Epidemiology. Lots of detail! I walked away learning much from this course.",4
20731,"As a Masters candidate in Public Health, I found the course quite informative. It covers all the basics and is helpful for understanding concepts in the subject. I study Epidemiology, and this course helped me revise and summarise the subject in the simplest way possible. Also, the language used, makes it easy for even lay people (with no health background) get a brief understanding of the subject.",4
20732,"Nice course, highly effective for other background. I suggest to improve the course content of week 4 & 5 which may be expanded with some other topics.",4
20733,Love this course it is a basic introduction to epidemiology a MUST! It's engaging and the instructors explain things in a really easy way.,4
20743,"I liked that the quizzes were not easy, it made me feel the class was worth it. It is a good intro to study design and basic statistics. Definitely a gateway course.",4
20744,"Nice course with the correct approach on the basics of Epidemiology. Only one minor issue, i think the focus on the historical aspects, although interesting, was a bit too much in the lectures and the tests. Being able to define OR or CI should be more important than questions on history. Overall, great work!",4
20746,Simple and logical for anyone to follow.,4
20750,I thought this was a good basic level introduction course. One suggestion is to update the quiz section to be able to click on the questions that were answered incorrectly and see the correct answer with explanation (after passing).,4
20753,It was overall pretty decent. Learned alot. Almost every lecture is applicable in my real MedStudent Life as an amateur researcher.,4
20756,Gives a great overview of Epidemiology. Perhaps more clarification on cross-sectional studies.,4
20762,This is a great course. It accomplishes its objectives to give a basic understanding regarding the basics about Epidemiology.,4
20764,Good introductory course for any biologist of life science student.,4
20766,Not as in depth as I was hoping for. Useful for gaining a more precise vocabulary for epidemiology.,4
20768,This is a great introductory course (and it's even useful if you've already studied these topics but need a bit of reminding). ;),4
20774,Great to learn the basics. Excellent explanations and to-the-point.,4
20778,very uneasy,4
20780,Great course and wonderful style of teaching.,4
20787,"Excellent Lectures! Some hard programming assignments. No TA or instructor around on line. Not too many to discuss in course forum. Overall, not an easy course.",4
20798,"It's a nice course ,especially made by Peking University and teachers are quite easy and charming ,Itbetter to have more pratical projects about C++.",4
20803,very interesting and worth using time loving it!,4
20813,A brilliant course which enables students to understand the fundamentals of Epigenetics. This was my first online course and I am delighted to say that it was a wonderful experience and I gained immense insight into the field of Epigenetics. I'd strongly recommend it to prospective students and academicians.,4
20823,"this course gave a general ideal about epigenetic control, and it is helpful to me, Thanks",4
20826,"The information is presented in a clear way and haves an apropiate level of difficulty. My problem is that the method of evaluation, with only multiple choice answers, is very lazy and easy.",4
20829,Difficult course but very worthwhile your time,4
20831,"I really enjoyed this course, and as an Australian it is so exciting it comes form a domestic university. Thank you",4
20836,Very clear explanations. Four star because I think that the part on X chromosome is too long and covered with too details respect to other topics.,4
20847,Interesting & Professional.,4
20854,"Wonderful course, especially for non-finance professionals!! Very friendly in learning.... Take enough time out to go and deeply understand the terms and concepts explained... This will provide a good head-start!! Cheers Vaidya Nathan Sir!! You are amazing... gotta meet you some time!!",4
20859,"A fine overview of many things , Good in terms of knowledge.",4
20862,I like the course pattern as well as contain. It gives you all introductory information about Financial Markets. I am sure that I have enough knowledge to trade in market.,4
20863,"Had an amazing experience , the faculty was well qualified an and with best he helped me best of his knowledge with the videos . My basics are mostly cleared .",4
20867,Very Good starting place for a thorough introduction to all aspects of Financial Markets.,4
20871,good n valuable info....hd there been more pictorial representations of effect of inflation wud have added value. Thank u.,4
20872,It is a efficiently designed course covering all the key elements which you basically need to know about the market.,4
20873,Gave a good overview of the financial markets. I had enrolled thinking it would be on the Indian financial markets. Would be great if there was a similar course based on Indian markets.,4
20877,It was a very useful course with a lot of practical examples.,4
20880,Great TIPS for everyday work related documents.,4
20886,an eye-opening course for teachers who want to develop their knowledge in communicative approach in teaching English language. Thoroughly enjoyed each module as it was very thought provoking and detailed. It was a great experience to peer assess too.,4
20893,"Overall great course, homework problems could be a little muddy at time and the significant figures asked for can be unnecessarily tedious",4
20895,It was very helpful and pleasant lecture. I learned the many. So thank you very much for all lecturers.,4
20896,"The material was valuable, but support very spotty. It took a long time to get feedback, and I usually fought through the question by the time a mentor got back. Maybe that's how it should be.Also; I got 100% for all weekly tests, but this reflects some social engineering skills on top of electrical engineering. Some numerical answers require 3 decimal place accuracy based on whatever approximations went into the original calculations for the number required by the Grading Bot. For example, one question involving phase margin had the wrong answer in the Bot; however, the number the Bot wanted was plausibly in the same measured output that LTSpice delivers when it calculates cross over frequency and the phase angle of the cross over frequency (which the Bot treated as correct). I spent 15-20 hrs on each week's material, frequently to sort out stuff like that. Can only give 4 stars.On the plus side, the mini-quizzes (with answers provided after bad guesses) were fantastic, and I hope future versions of this material will build on that.",4
20898,"Knowledge obtained is very valuable, but teaching stuff should improve by solving more examples in detail.",4
20900,"I really enjoyed the intellectual challenge of the course but I was a little bit disappointed by the set of problems for Homework #4. In my view, the whole set should be reviewed in order to make",4
20906,One of the best online course available for data analysis using Excel as main tool for analysis.,4
20910,a clear intro to some basic-moderate user level functions in Excel. Good for those who have yet to use functions and graphing capabilities of the software.,4
20912,"i am very happy as i was perusing the course despite the hard time i got while completing it, i earned a lot of skills from the course and am lucky that it helped in what i am doing currently because it touched many areas where i needed to apply a course outside, now that you did it online, it has saved me alot, the videos i downloaded for revision purposes... thank you so much for that.............",4
20915,Well Organized. Easy to learn.,4
20923,nice course with a good instructor.,4
20924,very useful,4
20929,Please add more manipulations within basic data analysis using excel course,4
20930,"It was very nice to get my skills expanded. I would be very helpful, if the professor included handouts with functions, definitions, and instruction (e.g. on how to create a histogram). This way it would help to review something later without the need to open the videos again and searching for the content one is looking for.",4
20931,Extremely engaging and practical course,4
20933,"I found out I already knew alot of the beginning material in this course. So I just used this course for learning Vlookup, Hlookup, and pivot tables. The histogram section was a nice refresher if you have taken a statistical class before. Very helpful and great examples.",4
20935,good course,4
20938,very helpful,4
20939,"Very clear, good course but if you audit, you won't be able to get the answers to the end of week quizzes.",4
20947,"wonderful, easy to understand",4
20952,Well organized introduction to Excel analysis. Well suited to beginners.,4
20964,Not life changing but it told me what I needed to know with a minimum of faff.,4
20977,nice course....good for learning basic excel....,4
20978,A nice course for begginers in excel which includes business data.,4
20979,"Everything the instructor did, he did well. I just wish there would be more.",4
20982,Good course. Basic level.,4
20988,A course help me a lot in Excel. I can apply what I have learned in my daily work.,4
20992,"Easy for a novice and very useful, but It would be better if there are more materials for each week.",4
21000,"Great course, very helpful - though a few issues around the techincal wording and interpretation of questions being asked in tests, and more support for Mac users",4
21005,"A good course for consolidating essential Excel skills, may be a little basic for some but a good introduction and lead in to the specialisation.",4
21006,"Useful, helping the entry level excel user to be more familiar with excel function and tips.",4
21023,"This course is a great introduction to fire safety engineering, it gives a clear overview about the subject. I really hope there will be more courses on this topic!",4
21024,great course but I cant seem to get a certificate even after paying and finishing it,4
21026,investing class with ideas i hadn't considered prior to taking the course.,4
21027,"entry level, very basic concepts for professionals. It would be very good for anyone who wants to know about fire protection engineering. No background is needed, but engineering background",4
21028,Best for Gaining Knowledge deeply.,4
21029,"Its amazing how the general population view fire just in a small perspective as opposed to the broader perspective, this course has made me to understand. Its amazing how this course has made bare all the facets of fire and its management. I really enjoyed the course....",4
21036,Nice course covering basic doctrine of EU law. I recommend it.,4
21044,Clears out the fundamentals of EBL.,4
21059,Helpful course covering the legal basis and institutional structure of the EU.,4
21070,"As a seasoned teacher, 20 years, much of this content is intuitive or has already been in place in my classroom. The course validated much of the methodology I already use, but I did lose interest from time to time.",4
21088,Require quite a lot knowledge on statistics,4
21101,"It was awesome to learn visualization. SVD and PCA part of the course could have been elaborated better, and a pilot project on that would have cleared the basic concept. As usual Prof. Roger is a engaging and amazing teacher.",4
21105,"Well crafted, carefully designed learning materials!",4
21108,Would have needed a litle more in depth explanation of the clustering analysis,4
21111,"Good course on plotting libraries and useful plots in R. Wished there was more coverage of ggplot and less on lattice, but overall a useful course.",4
21113,"When it comes to hierarchical and K-means clustering, the theory wasn't explained clearly. When do we use U and V for what purpose? How does D come in? I'm left confused after this.",4
21119,The course was fantastic. It was very challenging. I could do with some additional opportunities for exploratory analysis to reinforce some concepts.,4
21121,Really helpful. I really enjoyed getting familiar with plotting systems and also increasing my abilities dealing with data frames,4
21124,"Nice course, but too much focus on ""R"" as a tool.... Industries don't use R as much... The course must be made more generic and independent of R - understand it is not easy to do but ....",4
21128,It delves into many important topics. I would advice to explore the topics in much more depth on your own. Overall a good breadth of topics.,4
21136,Good introduction to patterns recognition. I found principal components analysis technique very useful. It would be great to provide more lectures about this topic.,4
21156,"The exploratory part was very good. But, PCA was a waste of time.",4
21158,Assignments were really good!,4
21160,The course is interesting and the content is relevant. I do think that there are some issues with project 2 though. I did provide feedback on that to the course administrators.,4
21161,good overview of how to make graphs!,4
21170,Great course,4
21171,"Interesting learning more about ggplot and base plotting system, as well as clustering techniques.",4
21180,Like the clustering,4
21181,"Very good course. I liked the clustering examples. They were a little bit detached from the rest, but they were also great.",4
21206,Overall a good course!,4
21209,Very detailed. Like the case study by Dr. Peng.,4
21215,Hopefully it could be clearer on dimension reduction.,4
21229,swirl is very used in this course. It is one of the best tools to learn R,4
21230,"Very interesting and insightful course. I enjoyed it.Assignment was okay, could have provided more challenge and depth though.",4
21232,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,4
21235,"A nice coursera, but I was a bit lost SVD.",4
21237,great course but wish to have more materials or explanation on svd and PCA part.,4
21239,"The only missing point I would say about this course is how to deal with skew data and/or outliers. Although it is not specific to ""cleaning data"", I think there is a good opportunity there to at least give some hints on this subject",4
21241,Very good introduction to the various graphing systems.,4
21244,Pretty good course. Nice content. Middle section on clustering felt random.,4
21246,More real data example is even better!!!,4
21250,This would be very effective for my personal skill enhancement.,4
21262,I found it very useful.Some space for improvement are better coding skills (naming variables) andsome more complex topics like SVD / PCA should be explained in a more intuitive way.,4
21289,Really Enjoyable!,4
21293,"My congratulations to all those people who worked to create this course although I have to pick up something I've found a bit annoying:1- there were two video where the audio were nearly unintelligible2- I would link the link proposed by the video to be possible to be clicked3- Some exposition imperfection (even if they make these video more ""real and human"")4- Since quiz are not so difficult to be evaluated automatically I found it a bit annoying to notice them locked by not-purchsing, even if I understand there have to be something which would make the customer to purchase.I've found the swirl experience great although a bit annoying sometimes but I've no clue on how to possibly improve it so.Keep up with this great work!Bye",4
21296,"The course did a good overview of the different plotting systems in R, but it rushed through clustering. I had to watch the videos of k-means and hierarchical clustering at least 3 times to sort of understand it. The matrix concepts went completely over my head. Otherwise, the projects were very interesting, and I would highly recommend this course to other people.",4
21298,I like the course and it was helpful in understanding how graphics work in R.,4
21299,The need update the homeworks,4
21301,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,4
21302,A quiz or project question on k-means clustering or PCA would be nice. Overall the course provided solid coverage of the three main plotting systems in R.,4
21316,"More challenging Problem sets, as in the R Programming course !",4
21322,"The course is useful with a lot of learning.The second half needs more of improvement, I think the pace is quite fast compared to others.",4
21331,"I have taken the course earlier, so am somewhat familiar with the layout and the materials. Overall it is a very good course and covers a wide range of subject matters. Roger has done a very good job explaining the concepts. I certainly would recommend this course to all who's interested in the subject.I realize that there's limitation on the time people suppose to spend each week, however, I would like to suggest adding homework, in addition to quizzes.Several video clips have some audio issues, not sure if that's fixable.",4
21333,Great content. thank you!!,4
21334,Very interesting and very much useful course - I really liked it. Very easy to implement in your daily leadership roles.,4
21338,"All the concepts you need, to manage the everyday leadership, either at work or in your private life.Professor Gregory Northcraft goes always straight to the point, very clear and effective",4
21342,Good conceptual insight. Basic but thought provoking assignments.,4
21344,"The course itself contains interesting material. However, identical to the course one of the specialization, the writing assignments of the modules focus too much whether the student can name all learned phrases from the module rather than letting them express the answer in their own words in order to show that they understood the content.",4
21354,"very good course, very informative will teach you alot",4
21358,"great course. Fantastic. The only thing that could be improved is collaboration part, that feels a bit under-thought. Description of case studies could be better in terms of what students should do.",4
21360,Very nicely put together course with straight forward examples and well thought out assignments.,4
21362,A little light in terms of depth but very well structured and clearly presented.,4
21366,Very much enjoyed the class. Articulated ideas in a clear manner allowing one to reflect and best approach problems.,4
21374,Very good & useful information that can be easily implemented.,4
21390,"Good information from a mass-production standpoint, may be adaptable to fit small-scale family farms. Overall pretty good.",4
21392,Very good course with solid background information touching on the fundamentals of US dairy farming.,4
21394,Great survey of dairy operations,4
21408,Some things are a little boring but you have a good overview of diary cows when the course is completed.,4
21422,Great course to start the basics!,4
21423,I enjoyed most of the course but I found the last week a puzzlement and not as clear cut as it could be. I'm still confused as to what settings to use for blurred stop-action.,4
21426,"This course was so fun to be apart of, I really enjoyed the professors and the way everything was explained. Although the sound quality could have been a bit better on some of the videos.",4
21432,"A good basic introduction to photography. Some nice resources are shared, including books and web sites.",4
21444,Loved the course... it was informative and interesting.,4
21454,"I have been able to be comfortable with my camera by switching on to various pointers, changing ISO , gave me the clarity in understanding photography at the grass root level.",4
21459,great course really enjoy it and you can learn a lot from this.,4
21471,"The course is a great introduction. I just wished that we could have designated people evaluating our submissions, instead of exclusively peer to peer.",4
21474,good introduction to digital photography with some good tips. some chapters are a bit too long in my opinion.,4
21477,"As a novice in Photography, this course taught me the necessary basics when you are starting out to become a photographer. Videos about content and composition of the photo are extremely helpful.",4
21478,"I have taken courses in photography before. I periodically attempt to brush up on my knowledge. A lot has changed with digital photography as a new medium. Everything is clearly explained and the professor is articulate. This course would be excellent for someone who is just beginning photography and/or it may be beneficial for someone who would like to review photography concepts. The peer review process could be improved, but also it is beneficial to review other peoples work. I still think its helpful to have a professional look at your work when possible. An extra credit assignment might be to join a camera club or talk to a professional in your community and possibly even show them your pictures as your progress through the course. The main thing is don't be too hard on yourself, or others too. We are all beginners here.",4
21482,"Pretty good, especially about composition and advices for hardware, bags, and discretion.A good basic course.",4
21494,Intuitively informing. Thank you.,4
21495,"Good:very wide and also deep in transferring knowedgeassignments are clear and challenging because they require a story to which the shots ghave to followNot so good:sometimes the shown examples are show too shortly, and the videos toggle between professor and motiv to fast. Show both at the same time woiuld helpthe (iOs) app is a bit limited (e.g. assessments can not be edited).",4
21497,The course full of very useful information. Also it is so practical and the assignments are great,4
21509,Learned quite a bit as a beginner photography student. One thing that would have been helpful is if the weeks were flip-flopped. Week 3 and 4 replacing Week 1 and 2.,4
21513,"This was a fun course. Information is presented in digestible, bite sized pieces. The peer review process works fast and well--I was surprised how perceptive the critiques of my photos were.",4
21516,A very good course that introduces you to a lot of photography related concepts and terms. The assignments are very hands on and fun to do. The course also gives you great pointers for choosing a new camera!,4
21518,"A fantastic introduction to photography, it is a well organized course with clear examples and a very easy to follow pace.If you're new to photography and would like to start building your knowledge about this toipic, this is the course to go. On the other hand, if you're an experienced photographer or have notions of photography, this will be a really easy course for you, but you will certainly gain a good insight into the topics you already know.",4
21519,Good and informative beginner photograph course.,4
21529,Fundamental but good course for photography.,4
21530,Great course for beginners!,4
21534,It was really nice learning a bit more of the uses I can do with my camera. thank you,4
21542,Nice for a beginner.,4
21548,"Very informative. I like the pace, but get the impression that the instructors never see our work. While peer review is awesome, professional review would be very helpful.",4
21551,Great course but it's too expensive....,4
21554,I want to say thanks for all the information in this course it was really successful for me,4
21555,Very good. Easy for beginners to follow up,4
21560,"This topic is excellent, I learnt lots of things from this course. Thanks to Proffers Peter to provide such good session.",4
21565,"As a beginning course for photography, it teaches you quite a lot.The academic in me feels like there's not enough serious assignments though. To pass this class, a lot of what you'll be passing will be fairly easy multiple choice tests, with only two assignments that specifically require you to go out in field and take some pictures.I have high hopes for the rest of the specialization though, as this was only the very first of five courses.",4
21569,"Informative, numerous examples, great for beginners. Locked content is the downside.",4
21577,"it is a very good course, it help the beginner understand more what is photography!",4
21578,I have learned much more about photography in the short few weeks of this course than studying much longer on my own. Great course.,4
21586,"Great course, I've learned a lot, but it is somewhat discouraging not being able to pass the course because I can not pay for it. I don't need the certificate, but I would still prefer getting feedback on the quizzes and getting involved with the assignments.",4
21592,"The instructors have structured this course rather well, focusing on fundamental principles to enable you to take good photographs (even without a sophisticated camera). What is 'good'? Well, this course is geared to make one dwell on that, steering you to give some thought about how you can photograph even everyday subjects interestingly; and the peer review process serves well in learning how to view your own work, and that of others, objectively. By the end of this course, you may be eager to invest in a better camera, or to sign up for the next module in the series. :) Thank you, Prof. Peter Glendinning and Prof. Mark Sullivan.",4
21595,Good basic Info,4
21597,this course covers basic and advance knowledge about cameras and photography that is what a new photographer needs in his starting days,4
21598,"There have been some problems and glitches, especially with the peer review but it's understandable since it's the course's first run. I learned a lot with this course, just starting to learn how to use the various settings in the camera. I also saw the instructor respond to some forum posts so that's a plus for me.",4
21603,"Great course!But videos are not very good technically. Too much ""jumping"".",4
21612,Great introduction course for people with absolutely no prior knowledge,4
21616,"Great info about photography, very easy to digest.",4
21623,"Great classes, but I do believe some of the concepts are a little scattered, the way you present them could be a little more organized so we get a better understanding.",4
21624,"Although I've been active in photography for many years, there was still new information. I enjoyed the assignments as they made me think more creatively about my environment. I enjoyed the class. reviewing as well as the reviews from the other students. Thank you for a great class.",4
21625,"I really liked the course. A few adjustments are in place, but it was nice to have the feedback and the attention from the teachers and Coursera community.",4
21626,Not sure why so much time was devoted to camera bags.Looking forward to the next lessons. Hoping to learn about being more creative with a camera.,4
21652,I've learned a lot about emergent phenomena on this course.,4
21653,"All the topics are quite interesting and surprising (and I mean every one of them), but all are treated like popular science with little insight. I had to read elsewhere to fully understand some topics such as reaction-difussion systems. All in all, I wish there was a version of this course for those of us who have no fear of mathematics.",4
21665,the lab was fasinating . i never seen those big machin in my life. THANKS!!!,4
21666,very good introduction but as i go through the videos and then do the quiz i feel like the material doesn't highlight exactly what is needed for the quiz. Maybe i'm not taking the video lecture as seriously as i should. Something else to reinforce the material cause it seems a bit condensed.thanks for a wonderful course!,4
21667,HighTech!! Quite difficult for someone who not from the field .,4
21668,"Thanks for overview of experimental methods and references to relevant articles!""Complete the essay"" quizzes looks like a joke",4
21669,"On the bright side, ""Lab based"" videos are excellent for visualize the techniques. Nevertheless ""Choose all that apply"" questions in the quizzes are very ambiguous, these questions should contain an explanation for prevent confusion at the end of every unit.",4
21670,it's interesting but it's quite difficult,4
21677,"I audited the free version of the course. I found it helpful in brushing up and polishing parts of French which can sometimes be difficult to find and study online. There's a great portion of French media that is incoporated in the course which is great. Film clips, comic strips, pieces of writing.If this course lacks two things it would be more assignments, especially practice quizzes. And above that, more detail for some of the topics. For instance, I found the covering of pronouns to be lacking, particular in detailing the difference between ""dont"", ""a qui"", ""à lequel"", etc. and then asking questions about it. A good course. I think worth the time.",4
21679,This is a great MOOC I really wish we can enjoy more French-oriented courses like this. I did not like that is basically pay-to-learn. Other thant that I loved it.,4
21683,"Very helpful, I definitely am much more equipped with ideas and proven methods to grow as an entrepreneur even with the challenges in economies like mine.",4
21684,"Good course for people involved in the design of public policies. This course is perfect to politics and CEOs, people with the money to invest or the ability to organice big group of people and educate them to invest.",4
21685,"Interesting course on how the startup ecosystem was build in Cleveland, Ohio. Especially interesting was to tell and read about how the startup ecosystem in the Netherlands and the countries of the fellow students look like. I would recommend this course when you're interested in how startup ecosystems work (and why sometimes they don't work)",4
21686,Extremely useful concept wise with case studies.,4
21689,Very good course,4
21690,"I would have expected more in terms of the depth of content beyond Ohio, but still it is very interesting and complete. A must do for anyone looking to build a startup ecosystem",4
21698,"This is not the entrepreneurship primer I was hoping for, but it did a tremendous job of educating me on the different ways in which public and private partnerships can potentially spur the growth of entrepreneurship in a region if utilized effectively.",4
21711,Very comprehensive. Good materials and presentations. Relevant to the current topic of Brexit.,4
21712,Some of the exams are hard so you need to be on your game for this one.,4
21713,"This course is very comprehensive and covers a lot of information, videos are entertaining and Prof. Alemanno is not only extremely knowledgeable (as are other lecturers invited) but also very enthusiastic, adding a touch of humour to the lectures which make them very light to watch. Full of examples, very didactic and well designed. So, from this point of view, I strongly recommend the course, I've learned a lot about the EU and I am sure others will too. I must say I am frustrated with Coursera though, as the course quizzes are not open for students who don't opt for a certificate, worth 43€. This course was designed about 2 years ago, and although most of the information provided is still valid, there are several topics that require an update. Also, as the course seems not to be ""monitored"" as ""live"" editions, there was a very low level of participation in the discussion forum and little to no response from the supporting team to student's questions. Although I understand Coursera is a business and must generate income, it might have been more appropriate to charge, say, half the price, for those who still want the certificate despite some of the contents requiring a refresh or don't mind joining the course in ""unattended"" mode.",4
21714,In a clear and easy-to-understand way to introduce the basic concept and major functions of the EU. Very useful and practical for the real life.,4
21720,"Interesting course! Gives a good initial notion of how the EU works.Two written peer-graded assignments are cool: it's very interesting to read peers' submissions from all over the world (I got ones from Spain, China and US).A major drawback: the slides are mostly bright pictures. It would be nice to make the slides more informative and available for download.",4
21723,"Really great course material. I spent way too much time on the exams and projects, because i believe not enough information was given (had to spend a lot of time searching through discussion forums, stackoverflow, help files etc...and while that is useful experience, it was a lot more time commitment than expected from course description)",4
21733,Great info on accessing data from multiple sources. Also some excellent teaching on relevant R code modules.,4
21736,Good intro course to learning about ways of getting data into R. I think the final assignment's instructions could be a bit clearer though.,4
21739,"The course of getting data is a little difficult, however, the cleaning data course is excellent. Using the package of ""dplyr"", I learn how to clean data effectively. My suggestion is that getting data from website can teach less, and the cleaning data course can add more practices.",4
21741,"Great course. Could be more interactive and could have more detailed instructions for the Course Project. Last task for the Course Project uses a function that is not covered in previous lessons, which I think is not OK.",4
21757,"need to be crisped, over all good",4
21759,This is a fantastic course. Well designed and incredibly useful as far as course content.,4
21762,"I really started to get interested in R only when I started this course.Before that, it was just an old, cryptic language that could not do more than what I can do with Excel.Now I am starting to see the full potential",4
21763,I took this course a couple years back. It's much improved with lectures and exercises around specific functions to help with cleaning up data. Thank you!,4
21765,Very good place to learn very important tools like dyplr and tidyr to access and clean from several formats,4
21779,Provide a good introduction to getting data and processing them.,4
21789,"A pretty good course on cleaning up and preparing tidy data. However, the material for a couple of weeks was quite brief and could have been more involved.",4
21796,"Great lecture, easy to follow with R studio. Assignment are moderately challenging.",4
21797,Could be more hands on! for example interactive tutorial where the instructor actually using the functions to demonstrate how things work.,4
21798,"The last course in this specialization had me second guessing myself on whether or not I could do this (based on how difficult the quizzes/course project was). I spent tons of time researching, looking at the forums, and programming documentation. Going into this course, I was surprised about how much I knew when it came to the quizzes and how my time looking at all the resources above decreased and I actually knew where to begin! The course project was still VERY difficult for this beginning specialization compared to what information is given in the lectures (spent over 16 hours on it and still didn't meet ALL criteria). However, it does challenge you to think and reflect on your knowledge. You probably won't understand 100% of what is in the course (especially the project) but you will LEARN especially if you are totally NEW to programming like me! My knowledge has increased and that is what I was hoping for. If you have those same hopes and do not mind not getting 100%'s on all quizzes/projects this course is for you. Do be mindful that I personally feel that this course requires more than 4-6 hours per week especially for beginners. I spent more than 24 hours on week 4 alone.",4
21805,"This course was okay, but projects required much more in depth information than the course materials provided.",4
21808,"The content is good for the most part. There are some errors in the instructions to the assignment which make the assignment more like a real-world spec than the authors probably intended, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!",4
21813,Kind of slow in the beginning but picked up to the end to give me a challenge,4
21820,Useful technics to make things workable,4
21823,A lot of self learning is needed in this course. Be prepared to search for function documentations and stack exchange. Quite frustrating but worth it.,4
21826,Capstone project is a little ambiguous. Although that's good experience having to find a way to reason out what the objective is based on limited information.Introduction to chained dplyr is incredibly useful.,4
21831,"It is a very good course, but it does not follow the same level of proposed work as in the previous course (R Programming).",4
21833,Well done. Thanks for a good course.,4
21837,Good coverage of topics. A bit scattered in early slides and assignments were often inconsistent with coursework. Overall a great introduction of what to expect when gathering data.,4
21839,Nice set of techniques and methods!,4
21843,"The course content is important. I felt the final assignment quite hard. I struggled a lot with R on it. Interesting enough, when looking at the solutions during the peer reviews, they seem to have found way easier solutions than I had. I am not sure why. I got the same result but my code looks way more complicated. Also the description of the final assignment was a bit unclear. For example, where we supposed to rename the features or not? Where we supposed to calculate the mean per activity , subject or activity subject combination? Where we supposed to select the mean() only or also the FreqMean(). etc.",4
21845,"This is an interesting, helpful class. It was challenging, and exposed me to a very wide variety of topics outside R for data analysis, including databases, XML, APIs for getting data. I would have found found swirl type exercises for those topics helpful, as the additional practice really reinforced the lecture material and homework/quiz problems. I also would have found some worked examples or discussion of the homework problems after they were submitted helpful.",4
21846,A thorough course on how to structure and clean dirty data before making analyses on the data - very practical course in R.,4
21856,The course material is ok - it would really need a book like the other courses have. It is much easier to check something from a book than slides/video when doing the assignments etc. .,4
21857,clearly this course gives important lesson. but i think lots of materials are overlaped with previous course. final assignment is really helpful.,4
21863,"in my opinion, with more details, we could learn more about R",4
21864,"Course is great, specially the assignments. Don't depend on lecture videos too much, this is a programming course so you'll have to get your hands dirty. Don't forget to work on swirl() package, its a great way to learn interactively.",4
21867,Great Course!The Course Project was really challenging.,4
21869,It is amazing to learn how many different kinds of data exists and how to work with them using R. Wonderful course!,4
21875,"Well pack, but could have more practice.",4
21887,Very well elaborated. Very useful and real exercises and tools.,4
21888,I think it is a decent introduction to data cleaning. Could be more detailed in terms of the content delivered.,4
21892,"I liked the initial approach of this course, aswell as the resources given. However, I feel that the difficulty the exercises showed wasn't really linked to the concepts: many things were not explained in the lectures, and I had to find the complementary informations in various sites. So, rather than evaluating the understanding of the concepts given in the lectures, the skill to look for further informations was assessed.",4
21893,"awesome course, will require a lot of reading and re-reading though - mainly for the R part.",4
21894,"It's pretty good. It should provide a high-level approach to ""getting and cleaning data""....and how it fits into the high-level roadmap of what Data Scientists do. Some of the quiz questions were written poorly - I expect better from an online course from a prestigious institution. I may have caught a few words misspelled as well.",4
21901,"This course could be a little difficult for people with no programming experience what so ever, even if they took the previous R programming course in this series. Examples are often a little too laconic and not all of the material is as practically useful as the best of it.However Jeff Leak teaches some excellent data tidying, cleaning and extraction techniques with modern tools and libraries, that I find very useful in my everyday work with data.",4
21904,"Sometimes get a bit boring, though the upcoming courses in the series are real-awesome",4
21910,"Very useful concepts taught in this course, one would be crawling data consistently as a full time data scientist. But even thought the pacing and project were good, I found the videos a touch boring. Nevertheless, it is part of the whole specialization, which in itself is serious education :)",4
21913,good introduction and practice being given on handling data cleaning. Lesser thought on getting data merely introduction. Still good to give a try if you are new in data analysis.,4
21916,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,4
21918,"Videos are very good and the content was well explained. However, in my opinion, at the last couple of weeks the content felt a bit too fast and lacked depth.",4
21919,"Good course, learned a lot especially through the quizzes and the course project, but slides/presentations could be more engaging.",4
21925,"Good course, though I have to say that the final project was a bit confusing, and I am not sure that the people who did the final project really understood the course and how to create a tidy dataset, as the ones that I looked at did not meet all the principles of tidy data that were outlined. What concerns me is that they all had similar issues, and are all doing peer review of each other - this means that there is no one that can make sure that their answers are really tidy...",4
21927,"Decent course for learning how to navigate data sets in R. Not always obvious what the intent was, but it was good for learning how R operators think.",4
21930,The demanding complexity for 'programming-project( final )' should offer little more instructional support on lecture slides.,4
21934,This would be very effective for my personal skill enhancement.,4
21938,"Actually, very interesting and helpful class. The one area around more complex structures (API, XML) warrants more attention, since I assume those are more dominant access methods.",4
21940,"The assignment was excellent but challenging, instruction wasn't too clear or obvious though, struggled for a while (good kind of struggle)The lecture was okay but the Swirl part is always fantastic.",4
21950,A reasonable course. Could use a little more focus on dynamically creating a codebook.,4
21951,"Honestly, I wanted to give complete 5 rating to this course, because the content of the lecture is well explained. But one feature I didn't like at all and that is Coursera has made it mandatory for the users to purchase the course in order to submit the quiz/assignment which I personally didn't like it. Except that the course is awesome.",4
21953,"Good course. I like it. However, it looks a lack of explanations or training for me. It possible, there too much material for this number of lectures, or just I haven't due background. Maybe, it makes sense to add more swirl courses for people like me to gain a proper comprehension.",4
21957,"Ok course, level of difficulty on assignments should be re-assessed and converted to kind of conceptual assignments and tasks than repeatable code in each offering.",4
21959,"Fun and interesting. Won't remember all the ways to get and clean data, but it's good to review them so I know what's possible.",4
21960,Some parts of the course felt like... here are some cool things you might want to do... Google them. Otherwise valuable.,4
21963,The Final Project was excellent. Really satisfying upon completion. Course was good aswell.,4
21970,"The course was quite good, but the last assignment was really much too vague.",4
21972,"very well organized, good teacher, good projects. PCA and SVD are pretty hard to understand for who is not in the field (statistics), but no evaluation on this topic.",4
21973,"Helpful, but more than half of the knowledge is in the swirl tutorial.",4
21983,Maybe some more notes about the quizzes and the course project would be helpful.,4
21990,"It is a great course so far, with a lot of applicable topics covered. However, I feel that some of the questions are structured poorly to achieve their goals.It is fine to have difficult questions where students are expected to do a lot of extra research, but it should done in a way that they students know what they are getting into ahead of time, and not include questions or code that does not run without explaining what is supposed to be done.It's just not a good teaching technique for learning.",4
21995,"This course itself is quite nice and important.However, I think that the instructor should have set more assignments to lead us know those techniques better.Moreover, the ppt can be more detail-oriented.Overall good but need improvement.",4
21997,"Very good content, but could have more content added.. I had much more free time with this one than what I did with the R Programming. Would be better to have more swirl lessons",4
21999,very helpful,4
22000,"Easy to follow. It would be beneficial to recommend this course before or with Introduction to R. Most courses that start teaching R programming, start with teaching about cleaning data before detailing other functionality. Nonetheless, good course.",4
22005,"The course is excellent. Only problem is, for me, it is very hard to understand the meaning of the final assignment. The description is too simple.",4
22008,"Easy to follow. Might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful even for those who have some prior experience.",4
22011,"Slides and videos are a bit insufficient in order to finish course projects.Apart from that, this course is awesome!",4
22015,Some thing were very dificult and i needed more research,4
22018,Course is great! Many examples are given on how to get data in various format.,4
22030,was tougher than expected. i learnt a lot!,4
22031,"Content is good, but the delivery could be improved (email alerts, assessment feedback, etc)",4
22032,Great,4
22041,Great course.,4
22042,Good introduction to data cleaning,4
22044,Thank you to the professors who made this course possible and especially to Dr. Peng who was willing to spend some time with us face to face via video. I found the course very challenging but at the same time I did learn quite a bit about R. Working through the course assignments and the final project was the best part. My rating is 4 stars because the course lectures are not engaging. The lecture style is basically just reading the slides to us and they don't take much time to explain what is going on.,4
22045,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course project. Overall, It",4
22047,"it's a little rapid fire, but the exercises are excellent for applying the firehose of functions and concepts from the lecture",4
22050,"The course is more challenging than the prior two courses, but also very rewarding. I can apply the skills from this course directly to my work, and produce results.A bit drawback is the some quiz questions and the final assignment can use more detailed instructions. Providing the clarity doesn't necessarily gives away the answers.",4
22053,Good course this...,4
22056,"I was pleased to be selected as a beta tester, but it turns out to be a little bit boring for a course I did already pass and succeed. Slides are unchanged, so my concentration drops after a while, even with some good will. It seems there are new swirl lessons, but they don't seem to be available yet, at beta test time, bad luck.I like the new overall presentation (provided by Coursera?) where we can pick transcripts without leaving the normal course flow. I tend to click the ""finger up"" icon for each lecture, because I just think the general organization of this specific course is quite good, and the contents consistent and not uselessly overlapping (unlike some other courses of the track such as ""Reproducible research""). Also, the theme seems to perfectly fit the 4-weeks standard slot of the track. I have been busy those days, so I didn't fully review the course yet: I'll try to review as much lectures as possible till the end of the countdown. I'll try to do it better for my next beta test, if any. Anyway, thanks a lot for that very interesting track (I plan to go up to the capstone project, certified).",4
22057,Very useful course. It's worth to add slides and to make sound of lectures bit louder.,4
22066,I found this course very interesting.,4
22068,Requires some knowledge of physics to do calculations. Concepts are well explained (with examples and graphics) so that anyone can understand the material otherwise.,4
22069,"Prof Djorgovski's lectures are excellent, especially Week 4. I may be biased, as I knew much of the Planetary & Stellar material before, I didn't know much about galaxies, so week 4 was all new to me. The quizzes are well designed to test the student's understanding.I'm giving the course 4, rather than 5, for two reasons: a lack of further reading, which many other courses provide; and the forums are almost completely dead. Generally I learn by discussing things with other students, with help from the instructors when needed. The course could work better, IMHO. This should not be interpreted as a criticism of Prof Djorgovski'slectures, which are worthy of Caltech!",4
22078,I have really appreciated this course.,4
22080,This is the third or fourth time I've reviewed this course but it still keeps asking me to,4
22082,covers a lot of ground in short time,4
22083,"In general it's fine, but I'd like to see more questions with calculations, such tasks help better understand the topic",4
22084,"Great course, contents are very accurate and comprehensive, explained in a simple manner.",4
22089,"Pros:ContentProfessorDepth of materialCons:Exams are shit, full of mistakes, stuid questions asking 2 values but you have one field to fill in the data. Totally unacceptable quality issues with exams. READ THE FORUM!!!!",4
22096,good course,4
22103,Very nice!! Thank you!!,4
22105,"You know what, it's not that complex.... it was never that complex...... humans are missing something very basic, elemental, kinda stupid thing I guess. Humans need another stupid.",4
22106,Course with deep notions. Prononciation can be difficult to understand.,4
22113,Great Content! Very recommendable.,4
22118,"Thoroughly enjoyed this course. Interested in the Fibonacci Numbers and Golden Ratio and was looking for more information, this was clearly provided.",4
22124,Great course! A little short.,4
22128,Good course. More problems sets would have been great!,4
22130,great learned a lot .,4
22134,"good course, to learn something new",4
22140,More real world examples of Golden Ratio necessary,4
22156,Great stuff.,4
22160,"I think this is a great overview for beginners in the subject of personal finance management. It contains lots of useful information, references to websites for everyday use, practical examples and exercises to absorb the content and put it to action. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the subject matter is US centric so part of it (taxation for example) is not as relevant for those who live in other countries.",4
22164,"Practical information you can put to use right away. This class was fun and easy. It's an 8 week long course, but finished within 2 weeks. It's not really time consuming, so I definitely recommend anyone who's not too financially savvy to give this course a go!",4
22166,Good course,4
22171,"Some concepts are a little difficult for a non finance person. However, so far it seems very interesting and useful!",4
22193,Good and short video lectures that gets straight to the point,4
22198,this is a good course with incredibly amazing stuff regarding the topics,4
22199,The peer reviews should be anonymous. I graded a students work and gave him a 0 on both questions in the peer to peer review section. My answers deserved a 10 and I ended up with an 18/20 because this person graded me badly too. You should come up with a way to encourage fair grading without penalizing the person who graded someone elses assignment badly.,4
22202,"I have finished it, cool.",4
22210,"Very concise lectures, but sometimes the content of the videos does not fully explain the topics that are covered on the quizzes.",4
22211,Great class by Professor Oktay! I learned a lot and quick abo,4
22212,"Overall, very useful syllabi have been designed. I wish for more detailed, or at least less repetition of materials in videos and notes. Some of the terms have not been defined for me, so further research was necessary.",4
22214,It was great to see how does it work in real life. I wish there was more example and more challenging scenarios. I did enjoy it.,4
22216,"There were a couple of bugs, but it was a great way to close a very well-designed course.It felt almost like a game!",4
22217,Thanks for coming up with a near real-life problem. I understand a lot of effort goes in creating these problems.,4
22223,Good course for quickly learning Data science concepts and creating winning Teams...,4
22224,Good simulation of a real on the job project.,4
22227,"Good to get a formal overview of all the phases and ingredients of data science projects, without getting lost in the details.",4
22228,"Great course - even for those with only a small amount of data analysis, this is very useful in explaining the bigger picturing of managing data",4
22232,Capstone project was very interesting and engaging in its interactivity. It is simple but not trivial one.,4
22236,"I liked the way the Capstone is structured, it's really engaging! However, I think it was oversimplified (I was expecting something more difficult that really challenged me and examined most things I learnt during the first 4 courses). Overall, a great experience though.",4
22238,Quite easy to do it. I was expecting something a little bit more challenging.,4
22239,Really realistic and fun! But it´s almost impossible to grad less than 100 after two attempts.,4
22241,was fun and engaging,4
22244,"Was not very challenging, I was looking for more detailed discussions. Good job",4
22247,"Very good overview. I did the full data science course but I'm a senior manager, so this was nice to get some organization perspective. Some parts might be a challenge for some IT people, but if you want to manage big data projects, it's worth the effort.",4
22256,"Fun and real life problems, is easy but would be cool to make it longer and a situation in which real several problems are found.",4
22265,Great concept. Perhaps a little bit too easy to complete :),4
22270,"By far, the best course in the specialization but yet too easy to complete.",4
22272,"The class was a little brief, but I really did enjoy the way it was presented. The real life situation, with videos, and a famous company made this hit close to home. I really enjoyed the ""choose your own adventure"" format of it as well. Unfortunately it was so brief, where the $49 price seemed a little high in comparison to the content that was available in the other sources in the Executive Specialization series. I also would have liked a longer or more in-depth scenario. Lastly, for any of the ""wrong choices"" that were chosen, a debrief ""why"" they were wrong would have also helped. Even though there is room for improvement (and thus a 4 star rating and not a 5), I really did enjoy it and found it to be a very enjoyable way to end the series.",4
22293,"Brief and clear, very easy to understand",4

22306,it's a good course in financial accounting foundations and I real liked the idea of the peer assignment,4

22341,I have lear,4
22345,"I had a little background of the concepts and content - and was therefore able to solve the numerical questions. However, for the uninitiated, the lectures contained more theory - while quizzes and assignments more numericals. Would recommend to include some examples of numericals in the videos so students have some idea of the concepts before trying real problems. Without this, some may find themselves lost. Otherwise, a good course. Thanks..",4
22351,Could go into more detail and be harder.,4
22352,The course was easy to understand. The example given were accurate to explain the concepts.,4

22394,Great introductory course to understand financial statements,4
22396,"For those who have already had majored in accounting, it may seem too easy. It may be considered as a course for review some basic accounting concepts.",4
22404,"The course delivers on it's promise - you will complete this with a pretty good overview of financial analysis and solid, basic, understanding of how to read a balance statement and P/L.However, I felt pacing was a bit uneven and the weekly quizzes didn't always capture the most important elements of the week's lectures. This led to missed learning opportunities and unnecessary stress on the final exam.The instructor speaks excellent but non-native and non-American English. As a native speaker of American English I found myself having to do just a tiny bit of extra work to understand some things and being slightly frustrated at ambiguous wording during tests and quizzes.All in all a very good class that with a little tweaking could be great.",4
22408,A good introduction to some of the basics. The presentation was generally okay; the course materials could have been organised a little better. Requires no previous accounting knowledge (though that helps) and only very basic math.,4

22411,very good course,4
22414,"Great course, especially useful to learn the specific vocabulary and get insights into Financial Analysis. I found some topics could have been explained more thoroughly, for example regarding the evaluation of discount rates or number of time period (we have the criteria, but no example of a method). Previous accounting knowledge is a requirement in my view.",4
22416,"It is a good ***INTRODUCTION*** to Financial Analysis, videos are clear and well edited and slides can be downloaded and are ok. Quizz difficulty is low, which is good for an introductory course; the final exam requires to calculate ratios and infer conclusions for a real company, which is a great practical exercise.However, students looking for a more in-depth course may check elsewhere for a detailed course on i) Financial Accounting & ii) Financial Analysis.",4
22422,Very Nice course for Corporate Finance,4
22423,A brilliant beginners' course for an introduction to accounting and financial analysis. Prof. Paul Kaufman is an added asset to this course with his simplistic definitions and examples. It definitely has a lot to teach and much to take forward in a corporate career.,4

22428,The information was laid out beautifully! Being prepared with this knowledge will help me keep the emotions out of giving feedback.,4

22437,Good course overall. Would be nice if the course offered review of questions we answered incorrectly. That would be helpful feedback.,4
22443,"I enjoyed this course and found the information on constructive work related feedback and suggestions useful.

22782,A basic overview of financial analysis starting from the structural underpinnings of accounting and moving into the frameworks of finance.,4
22783,Nice overview but does not go really into any detail. Some case studies would be helpful to see the concepts applied.,4

Students would definitely benefit from followup reading suggested by Dr. St Leger.Overall, a solid effort from the U Maryland team, for which many thanks!",4
22960,An AMAZING course for beginners. As a highschooler not pursuing biology in school this was still pretty easy to understand and enjoy (the reason I started it). Highly recommended for people wanting a light introductory course to genetics and a bit of evolution and those who can't take out too much time for doing an intense course.,4

23022,"The course is easy to listen and comprehend, and all material is pretty practical. However, it is rather superficial. I myself maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I didn't learn almost anything new from it (i'd say, around 5% of the information was new to me). I expected more. On the other hand, it's a good course for people with weight&lifestyle problems to figure out first steps towards a healthier lifestyle.",4
23026,Thanyou for the course .its informative. I wish there is more metabolic description and consumer behaviour,4

23083,"A very succinct, informative and pragmatic course!",4
23085,Simple and practicalI really enjoyed this course and how it managed to focus on the beauty and enjoyment of food as a main point in making healthier choices when it comes to diet. I only hope there is another follow up more in-depth course with more information on micro-nutrients and hormonal influence on obesity.,4
23087,This course was informative with great tips for healthy eating.,4

23132,"I am loving the Stanford nutrition courses. I think this course, plus the Child nutrition course should be mandatory for all human beings. What I wish could be done is that their would be offered more serious courses, ones where people considering the career would truly benefit from. These classes seem more general and light, which is good for people that just want basic knowledge, but insufficient for people seeking more than just that.",4

23192,"The course is very well managed and so informative from basic knowledge about foods and its nutrition then takes us a very fundamental but bold about nutrition and health. For those who does not like to read lot of books to come up with a simple and quick idea about how to have a health eating, this is a recommended one.",4
23195,this course is really helpful for people who wants to change their eating habits for the best. this course will teach you how to make first step to healthy food.,4
23205,"I found the information useful, good introductory course. However, not as challenging as I had hoped.",4
23212,"Too easy. The biology, history and sociology of food was the part most beneficial to me. Since I am a vegan from Sweden I tend to cook food everyday. The course seems to be mostly for people born in the USA. In Sweden, there are some problems with obesity and people buying higly processed food. However, the problem seems to be more alarming in the USA. Discussing the differences between how the average person in the USA eats with how the average person in e.g. Sweden, Greece, Japan, Brazil and Ethopia eats, would, I think, make for an interesting additional lecture.",4
23215,The course was really interesting and provide diverse points of view about the way how we eat. I really like the different perspectives provided by the presenters.,4
23235,Very interesting and informative but a little hard to follow when eating alone.,4

23293,"It was a very helpful course, giving an insight about our routine when it comes to food and health. It gives an understanding of how to take care of ourselves in the best way possible, and how easily we are fooled by media and the society to ruin our health in the long run. It is more essential than we think, to maintain a proper diet, so thank you for this.",4

23321,Simple but informational.,4
23327,"nicely made, but too basic",4
23332,"It's not a challenging course, but it is very informal at the same time. The interviews with the journalist throughout the course were my favorite parts because David was very detailed when it came to explaining how important food is a whole, compared to focusing just on nutrition individually. It's an introductory course, so I expected it to be an easy pass. Just take simple notes along the way, and you will pass the quizzes with no problem.Thanks Coursera and Stanford!",4
23333,The course is short but very helpful.,4
23335,"Very education, but short. I'd love to see more. Thank you for the recipes in week 5!",4
23339,"This course was great for an introductory course to food and health because it emphasized getting back to the basics of real food and cooking simply. It lost a star because I felt like there were certain topics that needed a more in depth and less cursory approach. They were almost dismissive at times for the sake of ""keeping it simple"" whereas a simple suggestion about washing produce to remove pesticides could've been helpful.",4
23358,This was an easy course and I found the information very helpful in making you aware of processed food. I think it could have been a bit richer by exploring some other areas of health and food. I felt like the main focus was on processed food. The good thing though I learnt so much about processed food and I'm making every effort to cut it and eventually eliminat it from my diet.,4
23359,"Very informative course, which has encouraged me to research the topic further and to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Based on my research, however, I believe a mistake might have been made. According to the instructional material, the only group of essential fatty acids is omega-3. Based on my research, however, essential fatty acids include ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid, and LA, which is an omega-6 fatty acid.",4
23362,"After taking this course, I know what the Nutrition Facts of food means and what type of food is good for health.",4
23365,Quite good for those in need of heathy living basics,4
23370,"A really comprehensive and complete course to a ""back to basics"" on our essential needs ! :)",4
23384,"Interesting topic and very good informationNot enough content (my opinion)Tests where way to easy, I could take them all without first watching the videos, and my grade ist above 90%. The questions are (espacially in Week 3 and 4) easy to solve with logic and a basic intelligence. Please work on making it harder! :)",4
23385,Good course. It would be nice to have 1 or 2 healthy meal recipes at the end of the course as an example. I like that I can work on the course as I have time. The only downside is posting comments for each chapter because it is not an active discussion.,4
23386,"Everything I learned or relearned fit with my knowledge of food and food systems with one glaring exception: I am a strong supporter of organic standards and regenerative agriculture. Therefore, I would be unable to recommend vegetables and fruits regardless of their pesticide residue.",4
23388,Hi thereThis course is very useful for basic learners and very useful to everyone irrespective subjects!!Thank you,4
23389,Informative and thought provoking.,4
23395,Good introducing regarding healthy eating and the dangers of highly processed food. I recommend this course for everyone interested in these topics!,4
23397,It is useful for our health and can practice English.Thank you very much.,4
23398,"I strongly recommend. If you don't have any knowledge about food - this course is for you. However, if you know some basic stuff you won't learn anything new, but still it is good reminder and very strucured. It is very short, could be completed in about an hour and a half. What I didn't like during the lectures - Maya (the lector) was not talking with her normal voice, but kind of slow and unnatural, which for me was extremely anoying. At the end, when she is showing some recepies it is so much better.",4
23412,Very helpful information for those who are trying to make healthy changes in their life.,4
23416,Good introduction! I wish it was deeper though,4
23429,"Basic informations about nutrition, but very useful. And things that you are not usually thinking when you go shopping food. Great!",4
23432,"This was a great course in learning more about how and why we eat the way we do. I enjoyed the detailed information I learned, and highly recommend this class.",4
23443,Straightforward and easygoing!,4
23445,"Simple and clear way to approach food, but it would be great if we could add more nutritional science and physiology based info",4
23451,wonderful course,4
23452,"I really enjoyed the first two weeks. It was all stuff I kinda already knew but was presented very concisely in a way that was easy to understand.The second two weeks weren't so useful and I completed them very quickly but I can see how someone who isn't too confident with cooking at home could benefit from them.Overall, a very interesting course that tackles an incredibly important subject in a succinct way. This kind of food education should be compulsory for everyone.",4
23461,Informative & easy to understand.,4
23479,insightful introduction to health and nutrition.,4
23485,"Very interesting and enjoyable, I think the mix between information about food and recipes for healthy food is a good one. I do think that for example adding recipes to lectures about certain types of food would make it an even better combination. For people living outside the US, the information about healthy diets might seem a bit US centered.",4
23491,i have some information i dont before know what it means so i am very happey to got this course,4
23492,Simplicity and good piece knowledge about fundamentals of food and related habits throughout the course keeps the person bound with the course.,4
23500,Knowledgeableble information covered under the topic.,4
23505,"It's a good course, I wished it was a paid course with a certification (a diploma) with more number of lectures that one can study in his or her part time upto one year. Dr Maya, your teaching style is excellent.",4
23507,Learned a lot of the history of food and procedures it goes through to come to our table. This course helped me start making healthier decisions day to day.,4
23509,Interesting and engaging. My only con is that a few pieces of the information was out-of-date.,4
23510,"it is VERY basic course suitable for people who really struggling to find their way to healthy food and even to its determination. Basic recipes are giving for home cooking. BEAUTIFUL illustrations along the course as well. BUT I hoped to find more scientific information about nutrition and suggestion which products might cause specific diseases. Would be also nice to have lectures from scientific point of view like: why it is unhealthy to eat before going to bad, which products digest slower etc.",4
23518,"very simple to understand, clear and direct information is delivered",4
23525,It is so useful.Especially the professor will teach you how to cook and I felt so hunger when I was watching.,4
23533,Very useful course for newcomers to nutrition!,4
23535,Easy to understand and do learned something in the courses.,4
23537,A little too easy,4
23551,"It is a very basic course, very useful for general public. But if your specialization is nutrition or public health, this course is way too easy and does not have enough info.",4
23552,"Very clear and well explained, but a little too basic.",4
23557,Very basic course with lots of common sense. But could be good for someone who never thought about their diet before.,4
23559,"simple, easy to follow, for everyone. Not really a ""course"" per se. Not many real nutrition ""courses"" on Coursera. :(",4
23563,"If you are looking for advice on how to live a healthier life I believe this might be a great course for you. However, if you are looking for depth in the nutritional science this course will be unfulfilling. I stopped after the 3rd week of lessons because this course did not contain the scientific information I was hoping for.",4
23568,wonderful info. thank you,4
23570,Very practical and applicable information. Great quality in the videos.,4
23598,Good introductory course covering a wide range of concepts. I particularly liked the lecturer - good tone and pace.,4
23599,Good introduction to the food and very easy to understand,4
23603,Informational and easy to follow! Thank you!,4
23606,"This was my first course, and I hope all future courses are exactly like this one! Maya has such a nice way of talking. The videos were easy to understand, without compromising substance. I also enjoyed the overall high-quality of the course. My only complaint is that some of the topics seemed a little bit irrelevant, such as the case study of a middle-aged, pre-diabetic man. I feel like that video should've been shortened by sevety-five percent and tacked onto the end of another video as an example.",4
23614,nice intro for people lacking basic nutrition knowledge.,4
23621,"Nice, easy to understand",4
23624,Good introduction course,4
23627,It is a basic course about food and health. You could learn the most important issues about food and our habits. You can learn easy tips about how to bu,4
23629,Very good introduction to a more healthy life style.,4
23630,A good basic review of healthy eating habits.,4
23637,Very engaging. Well presented and friendly. I would recommend this to high school students and really anyone who wants a basic primer on eating healthier.,4
23642,Very good Course for better understanding of daily diet and food habits.,4
23648,"Easy to understand, easy to follow up. Love the recipes, hence these just prove, cooking ain´t complicated at all.",4
23650,"Someone really put some work into this! Great if you (like me) do not have any clue on how to eat healthy.Somehow superficial treatment though, if someone asked me what i took out of this course i would say to best eat half vegetables and half meat/carbohydrates. I hoped for more answers on ""why"" questions, like ""why are vegetables necessary?"", or ""what vegetables are needed for what body function?"".Still, nice, flashy videos and great commitment of the editors.",4
23653,Great basic information about nutrition and health. I wish it would go a little bit deeper into each nutrient.,4
23654,Basic information useful for those without much knowledge of nutrition or want a review about healthy eating,4
23656,"Really enjoyed this course, thank you x",4
23665,"The course was informative, condense to be easily understood, and was well done. I left the course eager to learn how to cook!I think the course could have demanded / pushed the students a little more to think about this deeper.I am excited to try out the recipes!",4
23669,very helpful,4
23676,"This course was taught well, loved the videos, it was a bit basic but did serve as a great overview.",4
23680,the start has a steap learning curve but starts to flatten from the second week. Learned a lot though,4
23682,Good course in a sense of introduction to healthy eating habits. Would like to see more advanced courses with larger emphasis on vegetarian/vegan lifestyle,4
23686,"I liked everything about this course, from the presentation, to the method of teaching. It was great.",4
23688,"This course is informative course. Somehow, it may require some basic knowledge. Thank you and I have learned a lot.",4
23693,"Fundamental, but pretty good!",4
23697,"I really enjoyed the course, but i found out that there is not enough information about such aspects as vitamins, minerals and what happens to them while cooking, what methods of cooking are healthier, which helps most to preserve most of the nutritions and why, etc...Nevertheless, I really appreciate your job and it was amazing feeling to spend some time with you because it was helpful and i enjoyed listening to your speech, voices and the culture overall. The knowledge will certainly be useful! Will suggest this course to my friends :)Kind regards from your russian student!",4
23703,"Would have enjoyed to have been shown examples of breakfast, lunch, and dinners for people that are just getting started.",4
23713,Fun & easy introduction to basic concepts in Food and Health.,4
23717,"Good info, maybe a bit basic. Would love a more in depth follow up.Thanks for all your hard work.",4
23722,"It was really nice introduction, I would love to make higher level with certificate!",4
23725,"I enjoyed this course and learning, specifically how to adapt a healthier diet and the evolution of food in the US. The videos were interesting and the information was insightful and applicable to daily life. The only thing I might change in the course is having the professor incorporate definitions to some of the terms (i.e. nutrient dense, , metabolic abnormalities) in the videos, or as a supplemental document.I would recommend this course to others.",4
23734,"Good course, easy to follow and informative. I regret that the content was so basic, I would have loved more depth particularly when the instructor is so knowledgeable and such a good speaker!",4
23738,"Really interesting! Now a days I act suspicious about the food I'm buying. It's a journey to integrate this information to a healthy lifestyle, the workshop is great help for that.",4
23740,Interesting lectures with helpful tips for staying healthy. I would like to have seen more specific examples or supplementary articles to support the information.,4
23748,"Information: excellentVisual aids: beautiful but sometimes tedious and repetitive, sometimes unpredictable, more creative ways of visual aids can help understand and remember better.Overall excellent course.",4
23750,I found this course to be very informative. It is nicely paced and allows you to gain some insight into the whole issue of diet and health.,4
23752,Amazing content for beginners,4
23757,"Very good course overall. It gave me some good thought nuggets to keep in mind for the future. At times the course felt more like it was trying to sell the notion of home cooking rather than being about ""food and health"". Sometimes terms were hastily presented and maybe assumed to be common knowledge, which left me confused in one of the quizzes (""serum triglycerides"", for instance).The course touches on interesting topics that could've been elaborated more on, for instance how transfats are made.",4
23779,"Well, I was raised by a home ec major and a librarian, so I already knew much of this. But for those who weren't, it's very valuable.",4
23783,Nice and straight forward informationVery pleasant deliveryThank you,4
23784,"Great introductory course which gives a more nuanced view on eating. Everyone would be able to understand this and start to cook by themselves. Would have been nice if one week would have been dedicated to some myths, like the protein shake or gluten free diets which are very much debated.",4
23791,"Videos are very clear and very well explained... Nice animations, graphs, ... definitely a great piece of work.However, I have to say that I expected more content/theory on food and health inside our body rather than general advises on how to cook at home. I am a person that cooks already at home and does not like to eat much processed food, so majority of videos I found too simple and basic...",4
23795,its the best course on food i believe .,4
23797,Very informative,4
23798,Interesting to learn about the modern US diet and why it doesn't work. I thought it was a great intro course on benefits of eating at home but more important eating meals cooked at home.,4
23801,"This is a great introductory and time efficient course that allows anyone to get a brief overview of a healthy life style. This course, aside from the first video, does not go into the nutritional value of food or micro nutrient variables. So, if you'd like to get more information on how to cultivate your own healthy life style this is a great choice. However, if you'd like the more scientific side of things this course is not for you.",4
23811,"Course breaks down nutrition simply to someone who is new to a healthy lifestyle, or someone who just wants to refresh their memory on the basics to nutrition.",4
23814,"Great information, but in some instances I would have liked to see the course delve a little deeper into the topic. This was a minor concern however, overall it provided the information that mattered, and did so in a simple and ""easy to digest"" manner. Well done!",4
23820,I star reduced because it was somehow lacking in assignments and practical applicable steps to start eating healthy. A great base of information to build on and offer more in depth of what foods to eat and not to eat. Would also love more information on label reading and organic vs Other food. Extra Virgin vs Virgin Olive oil etc.,4
23822,"Its a good and simple intro. the the very important world of eating healthy, ergo being happy.I would complement it with Michael´s Pollan book ""In Defense of Food"".Excited to continue my learning journey...",4
23833,"Nice for a first approach, easy to follow. Good content.",4
23834,"Easy to understand, a simple guide that really orient me",4
23835,Simple and to the point. Good practical tips to lead a healthier life style while enjoying a variety of foods.,4
23844,Basic information but well presented.,4
23850,Michael Pollan is wonderful! Great fundamental tips. Music can be distracting. Maya's speech is a bit slow...Pollan's pace was stronger. Visuals were clean and easy to digest. Content was succinct and memorable. Appreciated the brevity of the videos. Thank you.,4
23858,Very clear and to the point. Easy to follow and learn.It will be longer with more in-depth details about the different topics discussed!THANK YOU.,4
23861,"I don't know what I expected. This course was quite pedestrian, but it *is* an introductory course.",4
23862,This s a very good course for the new so called busy generation.,4
23876,"I would have loved to get more information. Addtional readings, forums to share ideas and recipes, projects etcs about food, health and nutrition. Maybe homework would increase our knowledge! Some paper as final assignment would be helpful.Thanks for the course and enjoy your meals :)",4
23880,Very interesting,4
23888,"Awesome, very short though. A lot shorter than the first one.",4
23891,"In general, this course is great! Thank you so much for it.Great lectures, great videos, animations and slides.One thing I didn't like is the assumption, that cooking at home will do so much help in slowing down the obesity epidemic. Here in Ukraine most of us don't eat out, but obesity is prevalent nevertheless.",4
23894,I am currently pursuing this course and I find this course to be very simple for a rookie to understand and implement. It clears a large amount of myths that we have regarding different types of food. I understand that in order to gain full benefit of this course we need to implement the stuff presented in this course. So I will start the implementation and additional research required very soon.,4
23896,"Could be added more technical question, but I understand that the course is trying to reach as much people as possible.However explaining a bit more details about minerals, which was not mention, would be good. Extending to flavonoids and some other stuff which most poeple is unaware would be interesting.",4
23901,Great basic course. I hope it give more detailed answer about cases study,4
23905,"Very good basic course for everyone interested in the European Union. Here you can learn about the past and the present state of affairs in the EU, as well as get to know some future challenges. The course is filled with lots of EU-related facts and statistics and presents the EU from different points of view. I would say the course is quite a ""light"" one: there are no peer-reviewed assignments and quizzes are rather short and easy, but it definitely gives food for thought. Be aware that the videos are in French but with English subtitles.",4
23909,Introduces some good spatial analysis techniques. You learn how to integrate raster and vector data.,4
23918,I didn't love the final project for this. It took a lot of time due to some software glitches. Seems like that is unnecessary and should be better managed in the future.,4
23922,"Lots of contents, I really enjoyed this course. Good material and videos. Thanks",4
23929,"More in-depth work with ArcMap and associated principles. Redundant to a degree with the intro to the specialization, but good blend of instruction and assignments.",4
23937,"Peer Review system needs an overhaul. I would suggest increasing the number of reviews required by each student so you one incorrect (based on user error) review does not influence your grade so significantly.Otherwise, this is an informative and useful course.",4
23968,Not always as up to date as could be. Overall very nice overview of the different aspects of Global Health. Good course!,4
23970,"A very informational course. Gives a good overview of the concept. Only if they add recent developments and updates on infectious diseases like Zika and Ebola, it would be great.",4
23971,"Very interesting and insightful, with a broad range of topics. Thank you!",4
23972,A great overview to Global Health - though a bit dated. Still largely refers to MDGs and all....,4
23978,"I really enjoyed this course as it was an interesting blend of lectures, readings with practice quizzes and case studies. It gave me an overall understanding of the global health issues and I will refer to it whenever I need a revision.",4
23979,Very good initial overview on Global Health,4
24006,this course is really good. i enjoyed a lot.,4
24007,I think this course gives the basic & important knowledge about survey and data collection. Some can feel the course boring. But I believe the important knowledge boring sometimes.,4
24013,"An entremely good effort, gives you a wonderful introduction to the wonderful world of Survey Research in general and data collection overall. One of the plus point is that it directs you towards quite a few new sources of data that is pretty interesting if you are an active researcher.",4
24016,An extremely thorough overview on overall survey design methodology.,4
24017,"The deliver papers are great but slides are poor. In overall, a good course to begin learning about Data Collection and Analysis.",4
24019,"A good overview of surveys and data collection methods. The Total Survey Error framework is good, but its application isn't shown as strongly as it should be. Regardless this is a good primer for future material.",4
24040,"Fascinatingand slightly scary! Anyone who votes should watch these lectures. Some of the ""correct"" quiz answers are dodgy (illogical factually incorrect) but don't let this discourage you. Also, accepting peer marking is not for those with fragile egos or low frustration levels.",4
24046,"More detailed explanation possible. On the whole, very patiently taught by the professor!",4
24056,I have thoroughly enjoyed this session with Larry DeBrock. A delightful presentation.,4
24064,Detailed explanation about forensic accounting,4
24068,Was an informative and even fun course. However was too easy and I wish that there was more deep dives and challenges to push me further.,4
24072,"My review: 75%. It's a big picture course. Despite not so deep, it's sometimes a bit confusing, because the topics are aparently uncorrelated. Maybe in fact I couldn't catch it...",4
24073,Good overview of topic. Videos well presented. Poorly worded quizzes. Refers you to outside site where they want you to pay to access further material regarding actual fraud stories that they tease with a part of the story each week.,4
24076,Great Lesson and great mentor. Hope there's more case study on the next batch,4
24081,Very informative and educational. Case studies was relevant.,4
24082,Very well informative.,4
24085,very good introduction to the subject,4
24086,Very well explained and with excelents examples.,4
24098,A lot of useful information,4
24103,"Very basic stuff, but informative.",4
24105,"This course have improve my understanding on auditing, fraud investigation and others.",4
24109,Provides inside details each Internal Auditor should learn,4
24112,"Overall the course impressed me well,but even more coverage of broader topics/chapters in the course would have been an added advantage.",4
24115,Quite good but kind of too theoretic. Some practical examples would make the contents more understandable,4
24123,"Brilliant introduction to fraud examination, informative and intellectual instructors. It has really helped expand my knowledge of fraud. A+.",4
24124,It is very good for someone to have basic knowledge in this subject and want to stu,4
24130,Just buy the book and memorize it.,4
24131,very interesting course. Concise and easy to understand.,4
24142,"This is a good intro course which introduce the Finite Element Method step by step, which suited me perfectly since I hardly coded in c++ nor did FEM before.Nevertheless, as a graduate student, the pace is very slow, and the outline and motivation unclear, which would likely have discouraged me if I did not review video in x2, and stuck to second week lectures and onward.I would advise to introduce more outline and motivation at the beginning of the week lecture to keep students motivated.Apart from that, I recommand the course !",4
24158,A great introduction to the topic. It will leave you wanting to learn more.,4
24160,"The course was fairly good and covered different topics about big data applied to genes. The resources and the course content were useful, to get a good understanding about the field.The assignments weren't as good as I anticipated, I would have preferred more hands-on work.",4
24163,This course is good and useful.,4
24165,The course is helping to understand a lot about academic research.,4
24171,A good introduction to the Healthcare Marketplace though the pace of the class makes hard to understand all the economical concepts.,4
24174,"Great material, but presentation was way to fast and can benefit from some additional details and examples.",4
24178,"A very helpful course, it acts as a perfect accompaniment to the existing knowledge of any health professional.",4
24191,peer review is not fair!!!,4
24192,Very comprehensive and content-rich. A great course for the average citizen to take to expand their awareness.,4
24194,"This is a good course, providing quality information. It has a bit of a financial lean, as the professor has a background in this area; this was stretching for me as an engineer, but ultimately I found it helpful, as the financing of healthcare is an incredibly important issue! Unfortunately, the professor is a bit hard to understand; he does not speak in proper grammatical structure and often rambles or mutters, so even as a native English speaker, I had to turn on subtitles in order to understand the point he was trying to get across. Overall, after taking this course, I feel *much* more versed on the healthcare landscape and all the players involved therein. I recommend this course to students who want to better understand the general workings of the healthcare industry.",4
24200,There is no staff´s to help you through the course.,4
24208,Mentor review for the final project takes long time to be completed.,4
24216,"this is an excellent and rigorous course and a valuable preparation for working with data warehouses. frustratingly, the assignments contained errors, inconsistencies, and vagaries that left me wondering if the professors did this on purpose, to simulate real world situations. anyway, the bottom line is that this course offers a great opportunity to learn and practice. they say you get out of it only what you put into it. be prepared to spend 8 to 16 hours on the assignments. but it definitely was worth it. THANK YOU, PROFESSORS!",4
24218,It was very challenging. Not everything was well prepared. But overall good! Thank you very much!,4
24226,"Many Example and quiz problems have wrong answers, other all is prefect, simple explanation & great content",4
24228,The lectures do exactly what you need. He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems. The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz. It's not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better. It can be annoying for some examples though.,4
24235,I think it is a good courseany one can get benefits,4
24241,i think this course is extremely helpful if you want to refresh the subject without using the damn manual,4
24245,"An advanced course of fluid-solid interactions, probably suitable for first or second year graduate students.Personally I hope that the course can be longer (which is hard to achieve for courses on Internet) so more details can be talked about. Sometimes the students need time to respond to derivations of equations and physical significance of an equation.",4
24249,"Excellent course, making such a difficult subject very easy and understandable. But I really think that the pace of the course is fast when compared to the contents.Also the addition of numerical/ programming examples would be of great use",4
24251,"It was amazing, very interesting and well explained. Unfortunately I could not do the quices without paying the course, which is a pity. I would have rather done the course first and then decided whether to pay for the certificate. In any case, I learned a lot and this is very useful information I will use in my Ph.D studies. Regards",4
24257,"Great course. Very organized and performed.A more general point of view using non very complex examples and rich with applications.Congratulations!I suggest a second course using CFD and FEM, for example.Best Regards and thanks very much for this opportunity.",4
24262,It was a great course.However I expect more discussion in foro and the proffesors opinion,4
24265,It goes a bit too much into the details sometimes. Personal researches are sometimes required to understand what is explained.,4
24266,"This is a great course to have available. However, I do think that in order to truly grasp many of the concepts, you need to either have a good baseline statistical background (ie, more than one college stats course), or be willing to spend a lot more time looking up many of the concepts (though many can only be found referenced in papers). For those who are engaged in applied statistics/signal processing, this would probably be fine. The course was very interesting, but I do wish they spent a bit more time breaking down the statistical measures and more examples/figures/analogies to make the course overall more coherent, and encourage a deeper understanding from a big picture perspective. It would be helpful if they had optional supplementary videos that dive deeper into the stats for those who could use it.",4
24269,In general terms the course is very good. It would be great if they could include at least one real example of each statistic method presented.,4
24271,Some of the mathematical models and statistical models were hard to understand had I not taken mathematical and statistical classes on my masters. I really appreciated the slides for each individual modules; it made it easier to follow.,4
24273,"Statistics should definitely be a pre-requisite for this course. I study clinical pharmacology and my knowledge of stat was limited to mean, median and mode and standard deviation haha. good course though for whoever studied statistics.",4
24275,"The language is clear. The video edition is fine. The mathematical parts were illustrated fantastically. In my case , practice made master, meaning that I saw the videos several times and searched on wikipedia and googled words a few times. Maybe some ideas would've been better understood if it had been included the use of a special software such as AFNI or SPM, that's why I didn't give the five stars to the course.",4
24282,Terrific learning experience!,4
24284,"I found this course very interesting and useful. Even though it is more based on theory than in practice, it really manages to provide a wide range of ideas about different aspects that influence on education. It motivates active thinking about concepts that I personally had not thought about before.",4
24287,"Insightful lectures every week, but the assignments' grading criteria is a little too simplistic and does not push students to really think further about the future of education.",4
24289,thank you,4
24290,"This course let me the direction of future education and I, as a student in normal university will devote myself to this career.",4
24293,Insightful and reflective material; great facilitators.The sessions were a little less engaging in between because the facilitators didn't talk to/engage the user but were talking between them.,4
24294,"Really great course, with lots to learn. I recommend doing this course if you are self-led as a learner and motivated to develop your own thinking, as a lot of your learning falls to you and your responsibilities over your reflective blog.",4
24295,"great course except for the ""testing "" system",4
24296,"Good discussion video, faculties of UCL were excellent. should have more contents and further reading materials. Felt the course is more UK centric, also bit more insight to education referring to the old educationists should be added advantage! Thank you for this nice course. Need more such courses for teachers and",4
24298,"Very well structured, great lecture-videos with experts in their field. Love the vibrant discussion forums as well where i get to learn more about different education cultures from all around the world. My only one criticism is that it became to predictable - pre-lecture activity, lectures, discussion forum, reflection. rinse. repeat. thought perhaps the learning, and maybe the assessments could have been diversified more? Instead of personal reflections, maybe we could do reflect on case studies?",4
24303,it OK.,4
24310,Really helped to reflect my thoughts on education and how can we improve it. Got some peer reviews and they were really motivating and I am thankful for such great peer review system to Coursera,4
24312,Very interesting,4
24316,Good to know about education on future,4
24318,"I very much enjoyed this course, and it has an active forum with some good contributors but I found that it felt more informative and engaging on the starting topics, rather than the core question of what is the future of education. This may be more due to my personal interests rather than any fault of the course, however! Particularly enjoyed the first few weeks ""How do we learn"", ""What is intelligence and does it matter?"" and ""What makes a good teacher?"".",4
24319,"could clarify some more on the question it asks, for example, the question about intelligence.",4
24326,I enjoyed the course and its interactive nature.,4
24327,"Very informative. However, some videos have audio problems.",4
24329,"It was a pleasure to follow this MOOC course. It is a very good opportunity to assist some good experts talks and also share knowledge and experience with tutors and some peers around the world. I learned a lot by dedicating time to the activities and papers. Thank you all for your care and congratulations for the course. Regards, Arnaldo, Brazil.",4
24330,Well orgnized course with self-paced homework and essay writings.,4
24333,"so far I'm liking the course... i'm not really sure about the last assignment where we need to submit a TED kinda video... not sure how this complement the goal of the course overall.. but so far the videos and the journals are so relevant and make valid points to discuss and think about them, whether you are a teacher , like myself, or a learner or both",4
24342,Excellent course content supported with relevant excel sheets. Requires rigorous practi,4
24344,Great course. Highly recommend.,4
24345,Really good insight into the pricing of financial instruments,4
24347,"Good introduction to term structure modeling, arbitrage and other similar topics, quizes were challenging and required independent thought. Good course overall, the lack of guidance on incorrect quiz questions except for through the forum is the only reason for a loss of star.",4
24357,"The course in general is fine. Although it is not an introductory level, and users should be aware of it. By the time you finish it, you will have an idea of how financial engineering works and will understand the math behind the scenes. The required level of mathematics is not very high, and high-school maths are enough to follow the formalism. Also, several assignments are done in Excel, so basic knowledge of its features will help.",4
24361,Gorgeous,4
24362,very good course. the exercises are very useful to review the material but it seems that rounding errors can make the difference between right and wrong.,4
24363,"Eye-opening and powerful crash course introducing to the life of a quant. Problem is in the discussion forums, where there is very little interaction with mentors and week-long (or more delays) in getting feedback.",4
24366,Great course. Level of support from the mentors was non existent though.,4
24382,"Pretty cool course. I hope they come out with two course sequences, one based more on theory that doesn't back away from stochastic calc so much, and another on practical methods using something other than excel.",4
24391,"Good course for a dry subject. I feel that the modeling could've been more thoroughly explain. For example, the professor could've used cases to analyze/explain what relationships between variables signify in greater detail.",4
24394,It has better content provided than ours.,4
24397,"Nice course, covers a wide aspect of materials. However, much of theories are not that easy to understand, so it would be better if the instructors could add a little bit more real-world examples/applications of these theories.",4
24403,It is not an intro class. This course is challenging particularly when you are not an English Native. In this course the most frequently used model is binomial model that can be fairly dealt with in the Excel sheet.,4
24414,"Challenging course but I've really got a good sense of the mechanics of main financial instruments such as bonds, options, futures, swaptions, etc. Being able to do all the exercises in Excel is pretty convenient. Exercises are difficult because there is no feedback - it's either right or wrong.",4
24426,Inconsitencies in instructions and information for some assignments otherwise very good,4
24431,The course is good. Would be better if there are more examples given and lively interaction with fellow learners on the forums though.,4
24434,"Very well presented, structured and selected material, easy to follow, relevant and interesting. Quizz problems are well thought through and have a reasonable degree of difficulty and length.",4
24436,"have not finished it yet , but a very good course so far, a lot theory mixed with exercises.",4
24437,A very interested course. Only suggestion:a. if possibile more interation with the professorsb. being more realistic in the case studies,4
24465,I would like to see the discussion forum back. That will help debugging the answers to the quiz.,4
24469,This course provide with a lot of useful knowledge about financial market and different types of securities as well.,4
24475,"it's my first online course , i liked it too much . it was an amazing experience",4
24477,"Its a good basic level course, which discusses on how to think strategically and approach for the real time problem at hand.",4
24485,Great course.,4
24487,was an excellent c,4
24488,Great insight.,4
24490,"I really liked the material in this course! It was very helpful to gain a base understanding around big data and the potential insight and uses that come from tapping into it.In terms of the assignments and projects, I think the strategic approach to helping firms tap into insights from big data was a little bit vague.",4
24496,"It is a good introduction to data analytics techniques and methodologies. However, I think there is over-repetition of basic points which undermines the more subtle, yet significant, points.",4
24500,Just gives a very basic and layman level information about data analytics. Good course for people who are curious to know what data analytics is all about.,4
24501,"A more practical assessment should have been there. Although, 100% satisfied witht he content and the curriculum with insights from the veterans at PwC.",4
24510,Could have been more practical.,4
24520,"The simulation was very interesting, but there is a lot of theory leading up to that which was at times a bit overwhelming. Summary slides / videos would be helpful.",4
24524,Too many speeches with too few slides.,4
24530,Lear,4
24536,This course suit for beginner who wants to explore data analytics world on the surface. It is a good tool to introduce you to data-driven decision making,4

24556,Very well structured and presented - and great supporting notes,4
24562,Good summary in data decision.,4
24567,"An insight into pwc way of doing things. The course was worth the time, effort and investment. On top of all, it has pwc to ensure its value.",4
24570,A good start for anyone wants to know about data analysis,4
24585,"Good introduction to the topic, provides a high level overview of data-analytics and visualisation and their importance in the work place. After this course I'm inspired to dive further into the field and looking forward to PwC's follow up courses in the specialisation.",4
24587,Very good introduction into the field. Peer reviewed assignment could be better,4
24589,This course is very good and informative.,4
24592,Good to know the data analysis trend and useful tools.,4
24596,The course is helpful in providing a basic introduction to how data can drive better decision making in real business context. It provides a basic introduction to various tools and techniques. The best part is the final submission in 4th week which ensures learning from the entire course.A possible area of improvement is including more case study discussions during the course which help understand what kinds of tools and techniques should be used in which scenarios. Currently the course devotes very less time to this aspect.,4
24608,This was fun!,4
24613,Engaging intro course with superb visuals and virtual specimens.,4
24631,"very fun, informative and interesting. definitely recommend to any one interested in dinosaurs",4
24651,Clear simple language well presented. Keeps audience interested.,4
24653,Good learning experience,4
24658,This course is very important.,4
24664,Great course! Engaging and useful tips and tools,4
24674,THANK YOU!,4
24679,It was an enlightening experience.,4
24681,comprehensive overall view to the management topics,4
24685,"Great content but a little too slow in my opinion, still great input about management.",4
24686,"primarily thanks for financial aid,by getting financial aid from the couresera i entered to tis programmeafter get in to the course learn lot lecturers were explained well understandable mannerthank you coursera :) :)",4
24695,Excellent course for begineers,4
24700,Informative but there were less videos shown specially on real time situations.,4
24701,Many New things are available to learn. I am alrealy a management student but this course help to know me that i dont know anything and I am continously learning many new concept.,4
24702,"The course is an overview of the principles of management, but t's a great introduction to the principles of management.",4
24707,Great Course for those who wants to leant capstones of management! Good structure and materials!,4
24711,Start very basic but at the end it becomes VERY interesting,4
24715,A brief basic course. Good understanding of Management.,4
24721,The Fundamentals of Management is a good introduction into this area of knowledge.,4
24722,"That was fine. Not great, but fine",4
24726,It was really informative and brief course on management,4
24732,Nice course to know about basics of management,4
24736,great for beginners! simple explained,4
24737,"It was OK, but a bit too basic",4
24741,Clearly explained concepts and relevant references and resources.,4
24745,A good starting point for new or future managers.,4
24748,For a developing manager this has some great insight to help you work to become a great manager in this changing environment.,4
24749,"A Very Good overview of the ""Fundamentals"".One feels like they have all the information they need to start managing after completion.The Questions are fairly simple but the Content is Meaningful.Overall, I got a lot out of it, it's an enjoyable introduction to management.",4
24753,Very useful for me - a small farm manager,4
24755,"The course gives an overly simplified vision of management, but is still very useful as an introductory course.",4
24757,Concise. A good tool to learn in few minutes.,4
24758,too easy quizes(,4
24760,"I think management is not easy to teach compare to engineering. I didn't learnt many knowledge and not get plenty readings as well. Even I get some knowledge, it's just like I read an article or TED or Youtube. Since I have the inherent implication of China or East, I give it four star.",4
24761,Second and third function of management lost :(,4
24763,"Good information presented in a basic and unassuming way, with practical and easy to understand examples.",4
24766,Wonderful Content and well explained,4
24770,This course does not go in-depth into the selected management topics selected. I used it as a benchmark to make sure I am taking into account the most important / basic tools of management science.,4
24783,concise but great course. the teacher also uses some examples to explain. it really helps.,4
24784,Great course to give you some pointers. Not a difficult or a deep one but definitely worth its time.,4
24785,"Yes, this course is nicely tailored to know the fundamental of management.I enjoyed this course alot",4
24790,Really simple and easy to follow along. I learned things that will definitely help me work more efficiently in my business. I found it faster to just go over the slides instead of watching the videos.,4
24793,Quick primer of what management and supervising is about,4
24803,"I really found the course quite insightful, and was surprised with the amount of factors and variables that are taken into account when developing revenue strategy. I would have liked to see some mathematical aspect to this course.",4
24804,"Solid course, but needs a little bit of a more practical application of the theory presented. All in all fine upgrade for people that up to now haven't had the awareness of revenue management importance.",4
24807,"Course was very interesting regarding the application of revenue management and specifically reviewing ""Revenue Management Terminology"" within the context of past and present trends in the Hotel Industry, but the course and it's additional reading material were slightly dated due to the fact that ""Rate Parity"" was referenced many times and I understand those clauses non-existent on OTA contracts anymore due to their dubious legality. (It seems that most of the articles referenced were from 2013, and a handful from 2014/2015)Also, unfortunately, Augustin Cacot was a little difficult to understand at times, and I speak French!",4
24814,"Great course, lots of interesting material!However, I wish this course was not so fast-paced. If more time was dedicated to every subject and more examples were provided, that would make a learning process more effective.",4
24815,"A very interesting course outlining the important of good revenue management and flexible pricing to maximize hotel revenue and profits. I would welcome a few more practical exercises DURING the course and not only on the final quiz. Also, it would be good to have the tables and presentations on .pdf or . jpg format as details are not readable behind the presenter. Looking forward to the next course in this specialization, namely Demand Management.",4
24817,Very helpful. Only wish we had more opportunity to practice on a facultative basis.,4
24821,Last lessons were a bit repetetives. I suggest to introduce more real case studies or revenue strategy building process simulation.,4
24824,"You can get to know about basic points about RM, like user segments, forecasting and pricing.",4
24827,"Such a great course! Very interesting course with a lot of information on the renewable energies of the moment, its operation, numbers on it and advantages and disadvantages, also a lot of information about fossil fuels, in short an energetic vision of the moment.",4
24841,Truly enriching stuff.,4
24863,It is an excellent course,4
24874,"Very good and interesting overall, the slides are very helpful. The only thing for me is that it's going a bit fast sometimes. The content can be quite technical and for a social science graduate like myself it would be nice if some very technical things could be explained just tiny bit more. But overall it's understandable and clearly done.",4
24878,This very interesting course looks at both the science and economic factors that influence energy technologies.,4
24895,I though it would be a little more detailed. Thank you for the course!,4
24909,"A little too simple of a course, but meets the expectations!",4
24916,Solid basic course.,4
24927,It was really nice - I found the last week lectures most valuable.,4
24928,"Not enough teaching from the professors , just presentation slides. Which kind of reduced the human component of learning.",4
24929,Maybe som of the material i section 4 shoul have been given earlier?,4
24943,Good enough for a fast start.,4
24948,Great explanations for most subjects. The tests are significantly more complicated than the excercises covered by the lectures.,4
24949,Would've liked more on the truth table of the conditional.,4
24950,"A good continuation of Think Again I. However, final quiz had lots of bugs in it.",4
24953,It's a little bit hard for the fresh guys,4
24977,"Awesome course. I recommend it to all how like programming and biology, specially DNA.",4
24986,"This course gives a good introduction to some basic algorithms.The standards it sets for students, however, is very low. They ask you to download an already written piece of Python code and change a line or two.To get the most out of this course, I recommend implementing all the algorithms yourself, perhaps even in a different language.""Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences"" by Dan Gusfield will be very useful for that.",4
24999,Absolutely help me!,4
25003,I enjoyed this course because I learned about the more practical aspects of character design. The assignments were based of the same theory but didn't feel repetitive. The only thing I found was that the grading was veryyyyy easy.So: A bit underwhelming but fun and interesting.,4
25017,A very interesting experience. I got imagination level-up. Though it was really difficult to understand what should you do in each assignment. I've spent quite a while time to realize what to do each time. And some students did their homework completely wrong. But except of that it's a great course.,4
25021,Interesting course overall ! Suitable for beginners.,4
25031,"One of my favorite ones up to now, long and interesting classes with amazing artists.",4
25039,"I learned a lot from the teacher, and the guests gave useful insight into the industry",4
25046,"For the first course, you will only be drawing. You will not learn anything about programming video games. It was nice that they showed famous artists for cartoons, but the videos felt too long, with dialogues that felt like rambling at times.",4
25047,"I would have liked to get input on my work by an instructor instead of just other students, but it was a good exercise to hone my skills. I wouldn't pay for credit because I feel like my work isn't being professionally graded.",4
25055,I liked the talks a lot but didnt expect to be forced to draw :),4
25069,"An amazing course, I really enjoyed it ..very useful assignments .. opened my mind in different wayswould have loved references or so ..",4
25083,"Good course to learn how to use Galaxy. Only one problem, it was difficult to perform the final project wiht the knowledge we got from the course. At the end I didn't know if the workflow I used was adequate.",4
25084,"Good, but a brief overview.",4
25085,"I think the final project required much more domain knowledge than what the course actually taught.Peer review system can be sometimes very confusing. Some of the confusions can be clarified by reading bunch of past discussions, but it'd be much better if there is a single place (not discussion forum) where students can find all the necessary information regarding the final project and how to grade. I think this info must be part of syllabus.",4
25087,"I like the course, very useful tutorial to start working with Galaxy, as a programmer it gives me a lot of knowledge to help the bio molecular scientists",4
25102,"Overall very helpful. The peer review instructions for grading may need to be expanded; found helpful notes in the forum, unfortunately after submitted.",4
25105,"A lot of complaints about the final project for this course. To be fair, the course content wasn't directly relevant to the final project. However, there were parts of the course that communicated saved workflows, how to import, etc. In order to identify how to do what was asked I found an example workflow that could be imported. I also found an example history that allowed me to read through the approach and then complete myself. I was honest in turning in the assignment that it was based on an imported workflow. There is a big part of community and reproducible research to the Galaxy tools and I had no issue completing the project.",4
25106,Course was pretty simple but the project was the toughest and took me another attempt to pass. But i enjoyed it!,4
25112,Good intro course for people trying to understand data science role in Genome related data and other informations.,4
25115,"Very nice course. However, the final project is not very close to the course content. Still, it is very well doable thanks to the very helpful tutor / mentor.",4
25116,Awesome Course,4
25123,"Really interesting course! The introduction to Galaxy and all of the analysis tools is awesome. There is a pretty big cliff between the course content and the final project; it would be helpful if there were more detailed information along the way about what each of the analysis steps means (i.e., interpretation of the information, versus just knowing what file type to select at which analysis step). Based on the discussion board, many students had similar thoughts. Grading the final projects for others is a bit uncomfortable, given that no answers are provided for the counts, and there are multiple different workflows that could be considered correct.",4
25127,"This was a bit challenging, not in content, but more in organization. I felt like I was getting freshman-level lectures and than was given a graduate-level assignment. The directions and expectations could have been clearer but the TA was terrific in trying to help us thru our difficulties.",4
25129,"I feel dual emotions about how this course is organized. Although the Course Project was hard to perform without much background in genomics, it was the part where I learned the most - thanks to the staff and the other students in the forums.",4
25134,"Good course, great tool.",4
25137,clear content,4
25147,Good for students,4
25151,The course gave me a lot of useful information that really helped me to revise my resume and make it more competitive! Thus it was short and a bit simplified...,4
25154,"pretty good, would be better if some of detailed document in the video could be attched",4
25155,Good For under standing basic concept.,4
25157,It's an interesting course. I have learned and exploded many helpful things during study this course.Thanks so much for you all contribution.,4
25163,Wonderful and a must enrol for all those who are writing their first resumes.,4
25164,"Not bad, I knew some tips from this course, it was rather brief and informative, but didn't contain full information of resume writhing. So after finishing the course I can only orient on the samples given and on separate lifehacks, but not making my resume by steps.Still almost perfect",4
25165,Some information don't work in our context. But generally it's helpful to me.,4
25166,I have gained wonderful Knowledge. very good course,4
25170,really helpful!,4
25173,It was a powerful guide for building and improving a resume.,4
25176,A lot of content...great concepts I hope we review a lot of this things in course 3,4
25182,"It's a great course, with quality content. But I would like to see more practice videos for the tools.",4
25187,The course was very helpful,4
25193,Great course,4
25196,"Great look to the integration problems, drawing and theoretical exercises was not as good.",4
25197,I love open source tools description. It is really good designed course to refresh your basic. Good job from instructor side to make this course enjoyable.,4
25201,"A good course, but the learning curve in the middle shoots up so the hill is quite steep to climb. Some typos here and there in documentation, but overall a great course that really challenges you to think hard.",4
25202,"Pretty nice course, although installation and pre-requisites could use a higher note before installing since there would be a couple of tries before getting them working.",4
25205,useful information,4
25210,Week 3 wasn't taught well. And the assignment was too difficult. Other weeks were fine.,4
25216,"quite challenging, high paced lectures. It seems like an easy course because the lectures are quite brief, but make no mistake, there is no repeating of concepts or endless bla bla. To succeed in the assignments one is very likely to watch lectures again. Without any previous knowledge in this subject it is almost impossible to grasp everything by just watching the videos due to the new vocabulary and the information density. The assignments definetly take more time than indicated.",4
25219,"I think this course is great, however weeks 2 and 3 should be restructured to ensure students acknowledge topics properly. I had a bad time solving those week's asignments.",4
25224,"I like the course, and I learn a lot (having plenty of experience already). However, the assignments take far more time than the quoted 30 minutes, and a lot of time is spent installing and getting open-source tools to work - which I would have rather spent on actually hands on work on the subject-matter.",4
25225,"The instructions for installing the software are not very intuitive and can be very frustrating at times, so make sure to allot additional time getting it installed. The assignment time listed is FAR less than the amount of time to complete the assignment, again, make sure to allot additional time for completing the assignments.",4
25227,Good course. Give basic concept and practical experience in data cube designing and data integration.,4
25228,This course was not better than the first course. Not too much of practical included and mainly theoretical,4
25229,"Hello,Thank you for this well structured course. Exercises and tutorials are very useful to complement lectures and help increase our skills in the domain.Tools deployment and connection (Oracle database on Virtual box and pentaho data integration) was a nightmare.It would be great if you package all the tools needed for a given course into a predefined virtual machine image ready to be downloaded from the course.Kind Regards,Mouhammad Moustafa",4
25231,Excellent structure of the course and very interesting,4
25234,"Solid class overall, however video lectures do not provide enough background info to complete some of the assignments. Expect to spend much more time than the estimated 30 mins to complete.",4
25235,"I enjoyed the first two courses. However, I would have liked to continue but as a Mac-only guy do not have access to an Oracle database, which seems to be a requirement for the assessments and the case study.The first two courses went well on MySQL, so I'm afraid I have to leave here.Thanks and bye. If the MySQL option gets added, I'll be back.",4
25238,Great course to learn DWH concepts.,4
25239,"Very nice introduction to databases and data warehouses. The lectures are not very engaging, the plus is there are practical assignments for every week, where you learn the most. First you submit your own solution and then you provide feedback to your peers. I like the format of the assignments. What I dislike (giving 4 stars instead of 5) is difficulty in setting up the environment for assignments to complete - it took me longer just to properly install the software needed for assignments 2 and 5 than to work out the assignments. The lectures could be also improved.",4
25241,Overall - great course giving possibility to learn working on tools such as Pivot4J and Pentaho Data Integration. While I am more interested in Business Analyst approach - it certainly gives meaningful background to data warehouse concepts and data quality. Biggest disadvantage is in my opinion module 5 with rather difficult and unclear assignment. I wish instructions were more precise and whole assignment more analogical to presented examples.,4
25251,"I found this course to be a good introduction to reading a balance sheet, with a lot of personal examples.",4
25254,"This course focuses entirely on how to read a balance sheet. You will learn the three principal parts of a balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and equity), how they relate to each other, and how they describe the underlying position of the company. This is illustrated by the professor talking to a number of small businesses in the Urbana-Champaign area.If you have no experience with accounting or finance, this is probably a great place to start. It's a gentle introduction. However, while the focus on local businesses is interesting, a relatively large amount of time is spent learning about these businesses and their owners without necessarily teaching much about accounting or balance sheets in general.",4
25255,It was very very nice.I go forward more steps.I am so glad to take this course.,4
25258,I made the right choice when I chose to take on this course,4
25260,"I learned so much, and the format was easy to follow.",4
25262,"Thank you for the work and creative idea of presenting the information. I now feel as though I have an idea or overall gist of financial statements, however, I would like to get into the ratios and analysing part of these statements.",4
25264,"Very informative, enjoyed the course.",4
25268,"I think it's a good way to introduce the world of ""accounting"" but I think videos need to be more specific and I would have appreciated if there was some practical exercise and not only quiz! But all the informations are exposed clearly.",4
25280,"The content of this course reflects its title: ""Welcome to game theory""!",4
25283,A very great leture about Game Theory. Really appreciated,4
25286,a good course to learn the basics of game theory,4
25290,"Rather philosophical then mathematical. An accumulation of simple, but essential and interesting reflections on what game theory is and how it relates to reality. Thank you, it was very enjoyable!",4
25291,"Good intro to game theory. Many real-life examples, easy course to follow. Recommended.",4
25302,"Good introductory course; very high level, as expected by an entry level course. Basic mathematics only, which was good but also a downfall.Recommend this course, introduces some interesting topics and points. It has convinced my to pursue another course or two minimum in applied game theory.",4
25306,Good course to learn the basics of Game Theory,4
25310,For an introductory course to Game Theory I think it is quite usefull,4
25313,"Excellent course on game theory by prof.Kandori that will get you started on the concept, applications and some concrete assignments that took a bit of work for me to handle. I must do for those who are interested in a high level process theory with concrete applications.",4
25317,"Excellent introduction to the subject, good course to follow before diving deeper into Game Theory (as I plan to do). Small problems when showing images but nothing that ruins the experience. Dr. Michihiro Kandori is a great teacher!",4
25320,Great!,4
25323,"Excellent course and introduction to game theory. Some parts were difficult, but quality teaching needs to be challenging. I think there are areas for improvement, but I would overall recommend the course.",4
25326,Very good course. Should be followed by Game Theory II,4
25327,"A very basic course, and oriented more towards economics and predicting behaviors. The course sure is nice, but not what I had expected. Wanted something more on the logic side. The one by Stanford looks better-suited.",4
25336,I always wanted to know what Game Theory was and now I know. It is something that is a little hard for me to understand.,4
25340,Many thanks for teaching this course!,4
25343,"It is a bit complex, maybe it would be more feasible with more dynamic or visualizing resorces",4
25344,"I thought the course admirably fulfilled my expectations for a general introduction to Game Theory.It kept maths to a minimum and the explanations were clear and always backed up by examples.Seeed to be very little forum activity, don't know why... maybe that's just says soething about the sort of people who want to learn about Game Theory!It's a good length with a good amount of time dedicated each week. Sometimes it was a bit challenging, but all round pretty good, I thought.",4
25345,"pretty good starter's course, Professor explains information good, hope for more complicated one, less newbie friendly",4
25351,"This is very good basic course, a one star missing due to some difficulties in good enough explanations of some of concepts further used.",4
25352,It is good for any green-hand in game the,4
25355,Very good introduction to Game Theory. Works everything out with intiuition.,4
25359,This course explains game theory from the perspective of social science.,4
25363,sth not bad,4
25369,"Excelent project to close up the specialization. I loved the constant feedback and refining of an idea through the whole course.P.S: Had some problems with mi verification in the first week of the course, so I needed to retake that asignment; apart from that all perfect.",4
25370,"The course was nicely prepared and structured, in my opinion it lacked a bit of content compared to the rest of the specialization. But it's a good rounding up of everything we learned before.",4
25374,"Several comments, in general the course is well conducted,it is not easy to follow, but this is natural as it a very abstract subject. The exercise sets (peer-reviewed) where very instructive, but I think that the quizzes where a little too easy in comparison. I missed a little a more intuitive view, a broader view of the subject as well as a review of more advanced applications and developments, such as infinite Galois groups, etc.",4
25376,"Overall, this course has very solid content. In fact, this is one of the few (probably the only one) advanced mathematics course on Coursera. More specifically, in order to take this course, you need to have good understanding of group, field and ring. In other words, you are assumed to have taken general undergraduate level abstract algebra courses before.However, there are some aspects of the course that are worth improving. First, probably due to the nature of online course, I personally find learning Galois Theory online very challenging. The lectures themselves make sense. The practice problems and quiz, however, sometimes do not seem to be reinforcing the lectures. The materials on tensor product seem to be unrelated as well. Usually these are covered in a course on commutative algebra. In addition, there was almost none communication within the discussion forums.Overall, I would definitely recommend this course if you have good background in general abstract algebra. After all, Galois Theory has long been a capstone type of course. If you have some background but not solid, it is definitely still doable.",4
25383,"That's a great course for those who want to broaden their horizons in mathematics. Learning process involves a huge amount of useful information from different areas, such as linear algebra, fields and rings theory, and many more.But I'd like to share some thoughts with possible readers of this review.1) A learner should have a really strong mathematical background. I would say that it's a graduate-level course, and I couldn't recognize that from course description. Otherwise,2) One needs a HUGE amount of time to learn all the material thoroughly. Just to clarify, I'm changing my job now, so I fortunately have a lot of free time. And I spend almost ALL of one for this course! :) That's great, I'm ready to do that, but how many people have that kind of possibility? Amount of given information is enough for a separate specialization in Coursera terms, so maybe it would be good to split this course into several separate ones.. for sure, it fits into a standard HSE university course. But I can say that I do have some background in maths, but a number of years it was unused, so it takes time to recover a lot of things. Just my thoughts, but I see how discussion in forum is fading away, guess it means that a lot of people start giving up.3) And finally I would suggest to add some small quizzes within lectures as it's done, for example, in 'Learning How To Learn' course. In my opinion, it can help learners to catch more from videos.So, 3 weeks left to finish this course, so I'm starting a next quiz! Thanks to everyone and happy learning! Or teaching :)",4
25384,Actually rigorous and non-trivial maths.,4
25390,"Design Principles has been meticulously structured, although, I'd have loved to lean more on Typography. One feedback to Professor will be to update his content and include more contemporary examples.",4
25393,"Great, if brief course. Some occasionally ill-worded test questions. But this course piqued my interest for the ones that follow.",4
25398,Gave basic introduction to design principles but the assignments were very engaging,4
25408,Interesting materials.,4
25411,Some of the evaluation methods just allow other people how doesn't do to much work to just pass...,4
25412,This course really helped me understand what to ask of my Design team!,4
25413,Overall it was mostly good but the maths was not well enough explained and some of the course materials felt out of date.,4
25417,good tips for testing experiments,4
25420,"This is a great course with tons of valuable info. The peer-review projects are very hands-on, and you learn a lot by doing that. However, I wish there were more explanations for certain things (for example, for the experiments section) - or at least, more resources to get further info. Also, for Assignment 3, it would have been very helpful to have the answer key, since there is some confusion around some of the answers.",4
25423,"The first assignment was very confusing in terms of what was required, and it should be fixed.",4
25425,Everything is great apart of the third week assignment. I guess it needs to be changed.,4
25429,"This class was insanely insightful, and I found many of the topics covered very interesting and fascinating — towards the end of the course, specifically around designing experiments, I found that whole terrain to be pretty difficult to comprehend. I think the lectures have opportunities for improvement here.",4
25436,Another very good class in this specialization.,4
25438,Lectures are clear and extensively cited; assignments are interesting.,4
25439,very good course! the final was much more logical than the first course,4
25443,"Great for the first 2 weeks of class, the third week seemed really unbalanced though and all of the sudden was about 4x the amount of time to watch videos. I wouldn't have minded if the same material was spread to an extra week.",4
25453,Good explanation of few design ideas and technics.,4
25457,Really good introduction to interactive design,4
25463,"Can be very challenging if you aren't well-versed in the various problem-solving tricks used for MechE problems (how & when to choose axes/reference frames, how to visualize the motion intended by the sketch, where/when to assume friction exists or does not exist, etc). Discussion fora are relatively inactive for assistance.",4
25481,Fun course although a little too conceptual for my liking.,4
25482,"This course has a lot of info to offer. The instructor is enthusiastic and provides lots of helpful links to articles, books, and resources that are really useful. I also appreciate that there is a portion of the course dedicated to social issues in games, which often get overlooked or dismissed.However, the course appears to have been restructured at some point, which can make the videos confusing, as they refer to things you haven't learned yet or make you wonder if you accidentally skipped a video somewhere. That said, I also don't think the current structure is ideal, because what you're learning is sometimes at odd with the structure of the assignments—for instance, a game design doc isn't finished until a game is nearly done while a prototype should come early in the process. So why does the game design doc assignment come before the prototype assignment?Also, while I appreciate that the instructor attempted to make the quizzes and grading more fun, the resulting options are often misleading or unclear. For example, the typical grading options are 1) You barely did it or didn't do anything, 2) You went above and beyond, and 3) This is pretty epic. If the person satisfied the requirements but didn't add anything else, do they really only deserve a 1? I didn't grade that way, but the options suggest I could have. Also, if the question is ""Is this a zip file?"" these options don't make sense at all.Overall though, I recommend this course and give it 4 stars for the level and variety of information it covers.",4
25486,"It's okay, I like the instructor and I really enjoyed the assignments creating worlds and such. I found that Im not a complete dud when it comes to making stories, it actually comes easier than you think ,especially if you play games a lot. Towards the end of week 4 though, I was about done with all the theory and wanted to get back to some Unity work, so i bombed through those videos, and actually skipped social impact on designers (or something like that), but I aced the quizzes though. Kind of funny, the only videos I didn't watch are the only ones I got fives in xDThank you!Ugo",4
25494,This course is mandatory to design a good videogame.,4
25499,My difficulty in completing this course is that I am having to actually develop a playable version of a game. The information in the course is excellent but it is taking more time than I have to develop the playable version of the game I used for the exercises.,4
25502,"A lot of conceptual stuff going on, I learned what's a high concept document, a game design document, and the importance of prototyping!",4
25503,Lots of good information.,4
25511,"The course is great but there is some room for improvement. One awesome way to improve learner experience, I think, would be to provide one or two examples about what is expected to deliver for each activity (good/bad examples from previous courses, preserving anonymity?).I know a lot of creativity is involved in the process, but sometimes I felt like I was wandering in the dark, trying to complete an assignment without knowing whether I understood appropriately the instructions.",4
25527,"Nice lessons, but the ""teacher"" use too often the word ""right"", what is really annoying. I hope you caneradicate this terrible habit and fix the course materials after that.",4
25529,"good game design introduction course, lots of concepts, great!",4
25530,Peer review is really bad idea for such assignement when you are writing your very first design document. It's very subjective and peers cannot provide a valuable feedback on your work,4
25532,Very insightful course although the assignments were a bit redundant,4
25542,"Very interesting course. I am already familiar with software dev documentation, so a lot of it was not new for me. The style of teaching in the previous course was more pleasant for me. But I am well aware it is just a personal preference. Very good course indeed. Thanks!",4
25544,"The lecturer is very engaging and for the most part these lectures were valuable. A few of them bordered on ""why are we talking about this?"" though. Felt more like filler than actual value. I think this could have been condensed to three weeks without losing much.",4
25553,"There is a lot of writing here, but the course gives a better understanding of what is required outside of actually building a game",4
25554,Great content and great teacher. But I found the assignments and the quizzes not that great. I reckon the questions and corrections were a bit subjective and time consuming.,4
25564,"This is a great course, if you want to hear The Questions you need to Answer to make a good game design for your game. It does not give you the answers, but it gives you a road map to follow.Downside of the course are Quizes and Peer Reviews. Quizes sometimes have shady and non-clear answers, especially for non-native English speakers. Assignments grading criteria makes your peers to choose from 1 to 5. And 5 is ""you did so awesome, that you've impressed your peer very much"". And this is not happening often.",4
25566,"This was a very good course, however the assignments were too long to complete in only a week.",4
25572,"It's a really good course but I feel like you need more time to really do the assignments, one week between assignments is kind of little time to do all the design. Sometimes the lectures are not directly relationed with the assignments.",4
25575,"I would have liked that the written feedback in the assignments were mandatory, it would allow us to improve on our designs",4
25577,I learn a lot by doing assignments and reviewing other people's assignments. The important con of this course was some of its quizzes' questions which was ambiguous or badly framed.,4
25585,The information in this course is great,4
25588,"The course is not bad, right? It gives you interesting texts to read, right? And explains a design process, right? Is it OK to say right after each sentence? (English is not my first language, right).",4
25589,loving it so far,4
25594,"This course has made me more thoughtful and analytical, about things I did not really look at previously. Plus I learned to use Twine, it is a great tool.",4
25597,"Very good course, allows you to actually ""think"" and implement a game, which I love.Only issue is the grading. I would change the name of the scoring, makes it easy for people to give bad grades.",4
25608,"The templates are very good, but the course videos are too general.",4
25614,"This course has some great content and assignments that I'd never make myself do on my own, for that I rate the course highly.I did find myself often wondering exactly what was expected of me on the assignments, and during lecture I'd hear ""this is something to think about..."", but not what I'd like to hear which is ""here's what to do"".Overall a great fit into the game development specialization.",4
25616,"At the start, I felt this course was mostly uninteresting, irrelevant and unnecessary. Pretty much a waste of time. But as things progressed, I discovered there were lots of great theory and concepts introduced that play a critical role in how the game industry and professionals need to think and work.My only complaint after having completed this course is that the instructors didn't do a good job explaining why this course should be taken. Once you're in and working your way through, you should see the importance. But on first glance it sounds irrelevant.",4
25618,Once you set the video speed to 1.5 it improves a lot ;-),4
25625,"Very helpful information with lots of solid, practical advise (prototype! test!) and a few important questions to think about (genderfication? accessibility?) when designing. Excellent learning experience for game design documentation. Quite worth the time and effort. Thank you!",4
25626,"A lot was discussed, and many resources were offered, but I felt the general direction offered was too loose. When time came to do each week's assignment, I was not always sure how to execute.",4
25628,"The course has several mistakes; the instructor forgot to remove some of the clips taken wrong inside the lectures, and the project for week 3 was incorrectly written. However, in general the course is very appealing; it's the main part of making games. And if some may think that you don't need to take a class to ""learn to be creative"", this course was an excellent way to put my creativity in practice, learn about how game design works, and read many interesting articles and stuff from different sites, provided by the instructor.Highly recommended, it's a very fun course.",4
25634,"Great overview of how games are designed. Course includes brief overviews of key topics in a game such as mechanics, rules, story/narrative, input/output, and user experience. While not very detailed on each aspect the overview provides a starting point of the various ideas and components to consider when developing a game. Additional resources on examples of games and articles on the topics are useful in further exploring the concepts.",4
25638,great information from diverse teachers.,4
25641,"I liked this course, but sometimes the presentations was boring because show only letters and no images or graphics. But in general I liked very much the content. I think, that this course is very interesting and proffesional. I learned many new frames about GBV.",4
25642,"Excellent course, speaks not only to health professional looking to investigate introductory concepts related to GBV and VAW, but for policy professionals as well",4
25647,Pretty good,4
25648,Great learning experience! Beginners don't sweat it. Very good place to start with no prior experience.,4
25652,"Learning online was better then expected. Sometimes there was some hard tasks without all the hints, but searching for answers is a good way of learning. There forum isn´t very helpful though",4
25661,Excelent course for those starting from scract!,4
25662,"I enjoyed the course, but I the scripting part was still mainly, ""here's a script to add to the game, and then we'll look it over"". There was very little scripting until the project, which really didn't require much scripting either.I recommend adding more ACTUAL scripting, or a new section or course that discusses ACTUAL scripting.Otherwise, I did find it informative. I have a lot more questions, but until I see the final course, I can't say whether they'll be addressed.",4
25674,"The course teaches you the basics in Unity game development. It shows you the most important things, from usage of game objects, prefabs, camera and UI. But I hoped that it would be more extensive, that it will cover more things. Also the Quiz questions and final assignments were too easy.",4
25679,"Found that the course lived up to my expectations. It was a solid four week learning experience, where you get to know Unity. I do wish that the teacher would spend less time reading from a manuscript, as it hurt the immersion from the student's perspective.",4
25686,Great course! Congrats to the teacher!It was clear and I learnt a lot!,4
25691,"Best course for the starter,",4
25705,"Thanks for all, thanks for the opportunite.",4
25708,This is a strong start to game development using the Unity editor. This course covers the basics of game development from graphics to game programming using the C# programming language that the Unity editor uses. It opens the door for growth opportunities.,4
25711,"Good Course, but fairly easy to pass and repeatitive after week 2. Good intro for Game Development.",4
25716,Wounderful course. Congratulations!,4
25726,"Great introduction to Unity3D and common gaming concepts,",4
25727,Excellent introduction to Unity3D. Wish it went more into the process of developing games.,4
25732,I really enjoyed this course!,4
25759,A very useful course for beginners who have no knowledge of Unity. This is the best course to learn about the basics in the Unity and using the Interface. Scripting walk through was not enough. A few more exercises would have made it the best course,4
25775,nice course but needs more quizez in the middle,4
25779,"The way He explains is Good But it would be cool if he also Explains Every small thing in Unity. But yeah ,Great Course for a beginner though.",4
25786,"Great class packed full of info! The videos were fully explanatory in what they hoped to achieve, instructing in the basics of Unity 3D. An overall well balanced introductory course, my only problem was with a broken link to an assignment. I had to get the specific course materials from another student because the download link didn't work for me. I was hoping for a Moderator/Admin to get back to my complaint, but after a few days a fellow student that had the problem previously was the one to help me out. 4/5 Stars. Be kind to your classmates, you'll learn a lot from them as well!",4
25789,"Great intro to game development. I wish it had covered a bit more about coding in Unity as well as importing assets from other software, but overall very informative.",4
25797,"Introduction is much more than this course is, in my respectful opinion. When I read the information on the specialized program, I thought it was something more compact, more useful in the face of the video game industry.However, this program of courses is rather a paltry touchdown, an insignificant approach. I think it should be underlined that it is a course for those who have never had any experience in videogames development.Considering all this, is a great course. You have to be objective.",4
25803,Excellent introduction and good coverage as a start.Thank you!,4
25815,Some given assets need to be upgrades or provided for the latest version of Unity. Otherwise a great class well worth the time and effort.,4
25816,"Very good introduction to game engines, in particular to Unity 3D. There are several projects that provide hand on experience. The only negative side is that the first 2 weeks provide very little material whereas most of the work is concentrated on the last 2 weeks.Overall this is good experience for anyone interested in learning about the subject.",4
25819,"i liked and enjoyed very much but the discussion form is not good , i don't receive answers of my problems.",4
25821,"This is a very introductory course meant for people having absolutely no background in 3D graphics or 3D game development. As a student with some experience in OpenGL and concepts like 3D transformation algorithms and whatnot, I believe that the course clearly delves into the making of the games rather than having deep insight into the algorithms required for that which is absolutely amazing and easy to understand for a starter. However if the course takers are expecting a deep insight into the 3D world and the mathematics behind that, you'll have to rely on other sources like books on Computer Graphics. However as an introductory course this clears the required concepts to a required extent.",4
25829,Very informative and very hands-on. I enjoyed being in this course quite a lot.,4
25831,Great and very informative introduction.,4
25835,"Well this course is absolutely amazing, all the 3 projects were hard fun but week 4 was quite tough for me. Overall it's the best course to start learning Game Development.",4
25848,"Good Starter Course, will be Nice more Unity Examples",4
25854,Very interactive and extremely helpful.,4
25865,very good intro. to unity engine,4
25882,"Great course! It just has some small problems regarding scripts considering that most of them give some warning messages, due to the latest version of Unity which made some changes and deprecated some stuff.I've also felt sorry discovering that I can submit the tests and the projects only if I purchase the certificate.",4
25887,"I learned so much in this short course! I learned more than I ever thought I could about making video games, considering I'm a complete beginner. Great step by step videos for learning to make games in Unity, plus lectures about aspects of game development. It would not be very challenging if you are not a beginner, and there is almost no focus on writing your own scripts, so this wouldn't be the right course for someone wanting to learn to code their own games. I subtracted one star because there was no professor interaction (such as on the message boards), although the professor is very good in the videos.",4
25891,"It's a simple and straight-forward course that brings you through the basics pretty fast. If you have the time, you could actually do the whole course in a day or two, just coming back for peer review. There are no surprises and the projects are simple. The instructor even lists what the objects of each lesson and video are, so if you need to look back at a specific feature, you need only look at the titles and then watch that one video. It's also interesting to see what people think of when creating a second level, if they try to go further.",4
25898,Great course - You're learning the foundations of building games with the most ubiquitous game engine - Unity!,4
25906,Great course for introduce. Review the content of the four week.,4
25915,Good course with both theoretical and practical content.It lacks instructor and staff support.,4
25930,Solid course with a good introduction to Unity.,4
25935,"It was great to learn about Unity with step-by-step instruction. I think a little more code explanation would have been nice at the end (Like what an ""!"" meant before something...I figured it out, but it pulled me out of the lesson to have to look things up or wonder about them.) Very interesting stuff.",4
25941,great start for any one who would like to build his own game,4
25946,"We really need more coding on this one, perhaps half the time should be dedicated to actual coding. From creating environment grappling- hooks. As well as showing 2D gaming and how to work with Physics.The UI and the Unity Walkthrough on everything from Objects to Particles and animation was really well done. And the Tutor is very good at describing the differences between things, as well as alternating how to create things.",4
25948,"The course was really enjoyable, I learned a great deal about game development and Unity 3D in general. I loved the practical approach and getting to know the ins and outs of Unity a lot better. The very last project was the only part I didn't learn as much from. Where going through the code wasn't really helpful - as it's so complicated to someone like me who is very new to C# and coding in general, but I understand it would take too much time to go in depth and that isn't really what the course is about.Otherwise I had a fantastic experience and would definitely like to continue my learning with more courses similar to this! Thanks!",4
25951,"It was pretty informative. Some things felt too rushed, but I definitely learned how to use the basics of Unity.",4
25952,Course was very informative and helpful. I learnt a lot about unity and its tools and concepts. But there was very less scripting (coding) in the course.,4
25953,Good technical base introduction to Unity 3D and usage of standard assets for basic prototyping.,4
25957,"Great course for learning the basics of Game Development and getting into the Unity 3D Game Engine.Suggestion: The workload needs to be re organized, the first two weeks need little to no efforts while the last two weeks are more intense.",4
25963,"Excellent course to get started with. Concise and fun lessons with really fun assignments. I do wish the quizzes were slightly more challenging/longer.Would recommend, 8/10!",4
25971,Great introduction to Unity3D. Everything is taught in a very comprehensive level. I would have liked to see more fundamentals of C# scripting though.,4
25981,Good examples and great video tutorials. The learning curve it's well balanced and the workshops are well structured according the lessons.,4
25992,It was a great course.The topics were well understood and the techniques used to make the games are providing a good basis for further game dev learning (in unity),4
25993,Great introductory course to Unity ! I wish that we worked more on scripting .,4
25996,"I think the course is good. I could've wished for some more engagement from the lecturer as it often felt like he was reading from a script, and I might as well have read the script myself. I also think the course was very slow paced and I finished all the projects in a week alongside my MSc-studies as well as working part-time, I wish the projects would've gone more in-depth for those students who wished to put in more hours into the course.",4
26008,"Good course. A good intro to the use of Unity3D for video game development. A lot of the code is already given, everything is easy to install, so no coding experience is necessary prior. The teacher is very calm and teaches well.I would personnally have liked a bit more coding, but that's only me I guess.",4
26011,A nice introduction to Game Development. The content is great and it doesn't overextend to the point of scaring you off game dev. I would give this course 5 stars if it had a little more spice. Everything in the course felt too scripted. I would suggest doing some fun live sessions on the side or something to let us know we're not being taught by robots.,4
26013,"The only thing that stands between the 5 and 4 stars evaluation of this course is the fact that assignments should have a broader range of grades for the peer review (like 0-2.5-5-7.5-10).On all the rest, congratulations! It is a great course!",4
26031,"Great course overall, just an issue here or there, but great experience for the most part.",4
26035,Was hard to keep up with work as well.,4
26050,I learned a ton about game development! Fun course so far!,4
26051,"Good course that gets you going with Unity3D. Very simple to follow the hands-on lectures, just repeat in your own editor. The assignments are very easy, this is the easiest course I've completed on Coursera. Very basic coding involved, and you don't need to write anything from scratch. I will take the next Course offered by Michigan State University as well!",4
26060,"A very good intro, and everything works. I loved it",4
26063,"Excellent hands-on introduction to the Unity game engine, the development workflow and the many nuances of how these all work together for the artistic as well as the technical designers. I especially appreciate the instructor's careful attention to learner-centered demonstration, and for his respectful use of, as well as frequent nods to, Unity as a top notch engine for quality development. Packed with a great deal of information, and the demonstration of how to apply this knowledge, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is wanting to break into interactive media development, or is wanting to broaden their methods and application knowledge in this area.",4
26065,"Only hurdle was some downloaded assets that wouldn't work with the animator.Well paced, clear, and easy to pick up.",4
26066,Well taught course. Thanks.,4
26083,"The class started with great instruction and was easy to follow. Coming into week 4, the class sped up really quick and became a lot more difficult to manage.",4
26089,"The course works nicely as an introduction to Unity 3D, and some of the basic concepts that you may find later in game development.",4
26091,Very good course.,4
26097,Course very good. I learned a lot about architecture and game design with Unity .,4
26103,Excellent course about Game Development introduction. It will be nice if they include achapter about Mobile game.,4
26104,Great introduction into unity3d and game development.,4
26105,Very good introduction to Unity3d.,4
26111,"The instructor videos were clear and informative. The course had a balanced mix of game development theory and practical exercises. Solid introduction to the Unity game design platform. The projects increased in difficulty and time commitment as the course progressed, building on prior knowledge. The peer review of game files was challenging at times, but it was a good experience to create actual games.",4
26116,"Very informative, funny and practical.",4
26125,Good course to begin with game development if you are open to learning new things.,4
26133,"Would have hoped for a bit more coding without hand holding, but I did learn Unity basics well!",4
26139,good experience and definitely a great primer on unity. didn't really focus on coding until the last lecture; even then it was pretty minimal.,4
26142,"Well-prepared course that is easy to follow and teaches the basics of game development with Unity 3D. It was fun and engaging, and the instructor seemed knowledgeable. Recommended to folks who want to get started with Unity and game development in general.",4
26143,Awesome Awesome ! You have to pay for quizesThank you a lot for the cource like this,4
26144,"Love the projects and classes!, but i was expecting more interaction with the teacher due that we found some bugs in the content , we were able to solved using the forum, but i was expecting that the teacher step up",4
26145,Best unity tutorial I have seen.,4
26146,"Very enjoyable, and a lot of fun. Instruction is easy to follow, and the workload is quite manageable.On the downside, there is no interaction with the instructor or any course staff on the forums, so if you have any issues, it'll be up to your classmates to help you.",4
26150,"Good course, I learned a lot about Unity. However, I feel that it does not promote investigation by ourselves. Basically, the videos are the steps we need to do to complete one half of the assignment, and the other half is just about repeating those steps we were shown. Also, I expected a bit more depth in the scripts week, but I understand it's hard to add a lot of content for just a week. The course is still good, but maybe too easy.",4
26161,"This course is very good at explaining both how and why you would do things a certain way in Unity, something that is missing from most of the tutorials you can find out on the Internet. The professor explains concepts behind why you need to use certain components instead of just giving a list of things to match up to replicate the projects. I've rated it 4 out of 5 stars not based on the content, but because the response time, interaction, and feedback could be improved upon. The content is definitely 5 of 5. I took this during the first run of the course, so I'm sure that the course staff will improve on this in the future once they get a bit more used to running a MOOC on Coursera.",4
26165,"Pretty good, just wish it had more time to focus more on programming for this free portion of it.",4
26169,"For beginners of video game development tool (Unity), this course is a great start. I think it would be even better if it can have maybe one or two more weeks for more example projects, and cover more about scripting, computer visual, imaging concepts etc.",4
26191,Awesome teacher and awesome course.,4
26194,I really enjoyed the course so far. The explanation is great. The only downside is the video quality is not that great its not bad but it would be a lot better if it was better quality. Its very Blurry even in High quality. Although thats not a problem that did not stop me from enjoying the course.,4
26196,"I really liked this course. Although some of it depended too much on pre-made scripts it was at the level of games that make sense to a beginner without being to complex (like all of Unity's own tutorials are). Sometimes, it went to fast and I was quickly switching from Unity to Coursera to hit the ""pause"" button to give me time to catch up. I thought that it took way to long to download other participants work in order to evaluate it, but I think that is an issue with Coursera and not with this course.",4
26209,The quizzes are too short,4
26212,"great learning sets and again loved using all the tools introduced, but would love to see this updated with Spanner, Functions and other new features",4
26216,"Unless I missed something, the penultimate lab (startup scripts) seems to contain some errors or missing parts : the /proxy/proxy_cloud_sql script is not installed on the guestbook instance and there are some permission issues related to the SQL API. I wonder if the Startup Scripts labs shouldn't be positioned after the SLQ API lab, at the very end. By the way, it's not a blocking issue, just a little bit frustrating. Troubleshooting brings a stronger understanding of the various steps.",4
26241,"Great course to start learning html, css, and javascript. I personally would have liked a bit more in-depth discussion of Javascript as it went a little quick for me, however I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to learn some web development skills.",4
26245,"There was very less practice and understanding of AJAX compared to other topics like HTML, CSS and Javascript. Very less hands-on practice was there for AJAX, otherwise the course was very well set up and very well explained!",4
26249,The Javascript part isn't explained that nicely but overall it's a very good course.,4
26251,Very helpful and informative course!,4
26255,"Nice, but not the best.",4
26257,"As an Iraqi student I have to give huge thanks Yaakov Chainkin. He is enthusiastic and explains the materials very good. I hoped to know more about navigation bars, anything else was amazing. Also, I think the organization needed some sort of simplification. I really hope if this professor can teach in our American university.Thank you professor Yaakov Chainkin.",4
26261,It was great!,4
26262,I enjoyed the html and css portion of the cs but the java script portion is not for beginners.,4
26264,very good course,4
26294,"I loved this course. It filled in a lot of knowledge gaps that I had. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the JS portion went a little fast, and it was difficult for me to keep up with it having minimal experience with JS.",4
26302,"This is a very good introduction to HTML, CSS and at some extent to Javascript.The first two topics were very well explained in details. The classes had a good pace and every topic was made very clear. The exercises at the end were a good challenge that matched the level of the course and gave us that extra incentive to push a little bit beyond.The Javascript part was a little faster than the previous two topics (HTML and CSS). If only one thing should be corrected at this course I'd say that the same pace should be followed for Javascript.I'd definitely recommend this course as a great introduction and one of the best courses I've taken at Coursera so far.",4
26309,I would prefer more difficult excercises,4
26342,"I already feel like a web developer, all thanks to Yaakov Chaikin. Its been a wonderful and exciting course.",4
26346,best and very valuable course,4
26358,"Nice job, only that I believe they were quiet too fast with javascript and it wasnt well thought the way they did with html, css. Great Job. Cheers",4
26359,You learn how to produce a viable webiste and a lot of things that can help you develop your skills as a web developer.Sure it can get better because some things are not clarrified and u might have difficult time starting and learning the fundamentals and the logic of how to use the tools you are given.,4
26363,"The concepts are very clear conveyed. Even if you have no backgrounds on HTML, CSS and Javascript, it would be suitable for you.",4
26386,"I have just started this course, but I can already tell it is like no other on this site. It already feels immersive and I feel like i'm really part of the group. All the other courses seem harder to follow a long, but I feel great on this course.",4
26387,This is a very good course for getting your fundamentals. I like all the content it provides. It can be made better on the Javascript part where explanations can be made little slower or some more references may be provided to explain.,4
26390,"Concise, simple and well structured practical course to easily learn HTML, CSS & JS for web development",4
26397,I have godd experience during this course.,4
26400,"Great course! Good pace, enough challenge and nice teacher.",4
26413,really good course,4
26426,"The HTML, CSS and javascript parts are VERY enjoyable. The videos are nice and short and Yaakov is an extremely good presenter with lots of enthusiasm. There are a lot of review questions which builds up confidence. I personally found the ajax part to be over my head - because we are jumping into the code without a basic conceptual understanding of what the structures in the axaj wants to achieve. Thank you however for the explanatory links to the w3school ajax pages. I thoroughly enjoyed the course - and appreciate the manner in which you are making the course materials available. I also learned to use git in the process and this has been extremely valuable.",4
26437,Excellent course with great series of tutorials.,4
26439,I learned a lot of basics on front-end programming.CSS was through - the Java Script side felt a bit rushed.,4
26453,like everyone said this is awesome course. I just want to mention several things it can improved.1. assignments are too easy such that you can not really learn much through finish it.2. this course contains fair amount of content but don't go much detail into each topic especially the final week class video. it could have contain much more detail about how to implement the code and the mechanism behind it. Unfortunately that part is missing so you can only get a very sketchy whole pic and in the end what you learned from that part is just some funky words.,4
26454,This course has been very enlightening. I have come to understand the basic of how things work when it comes to web development through the use of CSS and JavaScript. Course materials were on point and the exposure was very educative.,4
26475,"Good course. I would recommend this to everyone who are interested in learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.",4
26484,"Good for beginner, except for JavaScript part where you will need to study JS externally as it may appear quite complicated without programming knowledge. Not so good for experienced desktop developer who wants to learn web: it's all too basic.",4
26496,Would like to see a second part for this course to pick up where it left up. Maybe even discuss further week 5 material and more. Maybe have more coding assignments for part 2.,4
26507,It was a good course and very thorough. I did get a bit lost during the Javascript module. A lot of detail in a short period of time. Would prefer if that module might be simplified.,4
26522,I feel it is too basic,4
26523,"Have completed 3 weeks, and find the course very good.Lot of effort to build the content, very clear and detailed and explanation and if you repeat it yourself while going thru the lecture, the concepts will be get much more clearer.Programming is all about practice, but this could be a very good starting point.",4
26557,Its Awsome...,4
26575,This is a very comprehensive course! I love it!,4
26591,"I loved the course, specially the HTML and CSS sections. The Javascript part was fast and technical, which made it hard to follow.",4
26592,"Overall very nice job! Rated a 4 because I feel the JavaScript was too rushed. I think the final usage of JavaScript should be reviewed with an eye toward a beginner programmer.I liked the website development theme and interview with the restaurant owner, but that disappeared along the way. Maybe the final week, instead of making the special random, could be something the owner changes that the code has to change. Perhaps that change could involve a change to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, although that might be ambitious.Again, nice job. Learned quite a bit.",4
26609,"This was a great course and gave me a very good starting point for HTML, CSS and JS. The only negative I found was that the JS module seemed a bit rushed and the assignments at the end of last two modules didn't really test my understanding of JS concepts very well. They were too simple because the starter code had a lot of things already written out. Making them more barebones and having the student fill out most of the details would be a more hands-on and useful activity in my opinion.",4
26619,"I feel that I need more explanation about the code, I don't feel capable to solve different problems on my own",4
26623,"A good course! I really had fun with this course. Mr. Chaikin is an excellent speaker and his course is clear, well organized and the videos are of excellent quality. This course could be further extended because the field is very wide. The only downside of this course is that I asked a single question to Mr. Chaikin and this is one of those Mentor who sent me wandering perhaps because he did not know the answer...I look forward to another course of Mr. Chaikin !",4
26627,Excellent course. Liked much for `Review your peer` & `real website design as assignment`!,4
26632,Great course,4
26634,"Assignments may be a little more challenging, otherwise the course is great.",4
26649,website is so slow,4
26666,"Nice course, very helpful!",4
26674,"It's a really nice introductory course and I have learned a lot. In the end, it's kind of loosing the depth though when it's comes to AJAX and applying JS for web development.",4
26680,Could've been more thorough. Basics still well taught.,4
26709,It's a very useful and modern course with professional team!,4
26714,Course is great!But I have to say there should be more practical excercises (writing code) through first and second part just to use html and css syntax in real world not only on quizes.,4
26733,only put Spanish subtittle,4
26759,A much appreciated course !!! This course give me a boost in my studies further in Web development. Will appreciate Johns Hopkins University team if in future you will provide the course on Node.js as well.,4
26769,"This course was a nice into to HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you have no previous background in programming, the js will be very hard to follow and is quite complicating. BUT this course will get you thinking and excited when you solve a problem!",4
26772,The AJAX part could have shorter sections of 5-6 minutes at most.The course could use more images/animations - too many explanations given at the code editor!,4
26775,The HTML/CSS part of this lecture are really amazing (5 star I would say). I felt that the JS parts were a bit rushed through and probably needed a separate course. I am also working on the side (as a backend engineer) and got the chance to apply whatever I learnt and not rely on our front-end engineer so it was great. Thanks for the course leader and the course providers for my first step towards becoming a full-stack engineer!,4
26779,"Most of the course was very enjoyable, but some of the lectures seemed to drag on without much happening and were pretty hard to slog through.",4
26789,"The HTML and CSS portions are excellent. The JS and AJAX portions move at a very brisk pace, making it difficult to understand and keep up. I have some cursory knowledge of programming and JS but it was still quite challenging to fully understand module 5.",4
26798,"Great course, though the javascript part is very fast paced and could be extended a bit more. As a beginner, sometimes it was very difficult to understand some code lines without using outside resources. Nonetheless, it is an awesome introduction course for beginners.",4
26817,"My first completion of a Coursera course, the materials are interesting. The JavaScript part of the lecture is kinda overwhelming, I wish we could have more practice and some more in depth or involved homework to help me understand the material and practice them.",4
26829,great teachings but somewhat improvement in the use of technology,4
26830,"Nice, the assigments were a little too easy in some cases and the last part with javascript it was a little too quick with all the code to make the webpage dynamic. But in general you learn all the basics to amke a full website with html/css/javascript.",4
26834,"Great course, covers a lot of areas. Things do get quite advances, particlarly later on in the Javascript modules so you might have to watch it a few times. Yakoov does a great deal of explanation in order for you to understanding, but somethings might not sink in straight away. The assignments are a great way to troubleshoot issues and their is great support on the discussions fourm. Would recommend. Thank you!",4
26848,"Well organised and presented, but the assignments need to be ""meatier"". There's almost no actual coding involved, very little scope to practice what we learned.",4
26885,This is the best Intro to web development course on Coursera. The other courses don't take the time to explain the whys.,4
26889,Javascript would be better!,4
26898,"I really loved the way HTML 5, CSS 3 and Bootstrap was taught! Great job there. I just wish javascript was covered in more detail.",4
26904,"I liked it, but still a little advanced for me. Starts simple, but I recommend starting somewhere else for Java if it is new to you.",4
26930,"Great course for beginners. First half is really good, but the second half looks slightly unaccomplished.",4
26939,"Besides the Course been very good, I thing it could be a little bit harder. After watch the lectures of Module 3, I got sad because the Assignment didn't asked for a lot of things we have learned.",4
26958,Very good session on the basics and Javascript. This gives overall good idea on the Web application development.,4
26973,"A good course for beginners, consisting mainly of following along as the instructor demonstrates code. The assignments are short and largely restricted to modifying supplied code. This is a necessary restriction of the peer-review grading process: the problem must be highly constrained in order for an untrained person to quickly grade it. You could certainly learn a lot by completing extra examples from a book or other resources, but this is not required to pass the course.",4
26976,"This was a good course. The most valuable parts were the practical tips: using the Chrome developer tools, showing console.log(), etc. The first two assignments were challenging and fun. The last two on javascript were a bit less useful, but overall a very good course.",4
26979,The instructor is great and I had fun watching Yaakov. I've also learnt a lot of stuff. I wish course would be a bit longer and contained a bit more challenging assignments. Especially those ones which are in the middle of week.,4
26983,"I wasn't being fair on my review, it was my mistake that I didn't see this is a part of a bigger course. I feel like it doesn't deserve 5 stars because the way the exercises were made didn't help me retain information. I feel like the students should do more.",4
26993,Assignment were very easy,4
27015,so far its great just a step to fast sometimes .,4
27052,"The course is a good opportunity to get started with html, css and javascript. Personally I would have liked more time doing more smaller assignments. If you are totally new in this it might get somewhat fast. But of course that's the reason to start the challenge!",4
27084,"Good Course, the professor goes into the inner workings of HTML and CSS.",4
27095,"This course was great in terms of material composition and the lecturer! I learned a lot and will definitely recommend it to others. I'm also taking the AngularJS course, because I really liked this one!On the down side: in my opinion, the assignments (especially week 3 & 4) could be more challenging, as the course is targetted at web developers, so people familiar with coding. I found them quite easy. I understand that the last assignment was aimed mostly at forcing students to view all the lectures or get familiar with the provided code, but doing something bigger for the assignment (or at least without such obvious hints) would be a nice challenge and bring more value to the certificate, I think.Splitting week 4 into two with separate assignments is also worth considering, as there was a lot of material covered in the last week, in my opinion (but I may be biased, as I went through the last week in a hurry, because I was late with my assignment).",4
27097,"First of all the instructor had a really well put together material and equipment (sound was clear, the slides made sense, there was live coding in some lectures).The assignments where challenging enough in weeks 1, 2, and 3.For the 4th week however, I found the assignment a little difficult due to lack of explanation caused, in my opinion, by the fact that the we only had one week to introduce JavaScript and ajax.Overall I definitely recommend this course to someone trying to enter the web development scene",4
27099,Very eay to follow and an excellent profesor,4
27101,Fourth week of the course was too much to handle and imbibe.Could not practice and complete within stipulated time,4
27104,The course was great. Everything is explained simply yet with a great amount of detail. The staff was superb in their support and responsiveness. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the length. I feel like the JS/AJAX portion could/should be two weeks instead of 1.,4
27127,"The Ajax part was my favorite part of the course, i'll not give a five star because third week for me was a little to much talk, i know its importante to talk about getting specs with the client or following a wireframe, but we have another courses for that, and sometimes thas was not how it happens in the real world",4
27130,Nice course. The last week should be split into two with more comprehensive js examination.,4
27145,i like the course,4
27157,"The class is very well put together and the instructor does a great job explaining things. I enrolled in this class just to see how things worked on coursera and wanted to do that with a simple starter style course.Personally I think that this course should have stayed away from ui-toolkits and js frameworks (maybe just using something like normalize.css or reset.css). Maybe going into more things like @imports and writing maintainable html. css, and javascript. Anyway, it is minor i guess because in the end you still had to do some overriding of styles so you did write some of your own css.All-in-all it was a fun first course for me on coursera.",4
27166,Very good course!Assignments deserve to be longer and more challenging though,4
27183,"The content of the course is excellent. Descriptions are also excellent and very complete. The course has been created so that most people can understand what's happening here (even if you're new to programming).I'm only giving this 4 stars because there are some things that make this course too slow, in my opinion. I don't think you need to mention which file we are working on [after the first couple of times] because we can easily see that by the name of the file and the browser of Sublime. Those are a few seconds that are a waste of time.Secondly, I think that the questions in the practice questionnaires are a bit too easy. I didn't feel like they prepared me enough for the project at the end of week 2. You mostly ask if something is true/not which is too easy to guess. I think you would greatly improve the quality of the course if you designed some mini-situations. For instance (not sure if Coursera allows it), show a mini mockup and give 10 lines of code. Then ask how you will add another div to the top right of the mockup so that it aligns with the current code without breaking. Making those exercises not the same as your lecture code is going to help improve self-awareness. Currently, I think that people find it way too easy to select the right answer, since it's easy to remember what you said and what not.I also understand that you wanted us to like the page for good reasons (because you look an extremely radiant and happy person) but I think you oversold it a bit. You should have mentioned that once or twice, but no more. Seeing it in a few of the examples wasn't quite my cup of tea.On a good note, I was extremely [pleasantly] surprised when you did that real world project thing. That was an amazing idea and you're executing the details quite well (not writing 100% code on-screen, etc.). I really like how you sometimes say that we should look up the reference by ourselves, since that's what most programmers do (I study CS and after 3 years, plus a 6 month internship at a big company, this can't be more true).I'm definitely giving this a 5* if you fix the questions to be harder and a bit more different to what you said in the respective video. They should make you think. Also, some of them could be open answers, requiring you to recall classes/code by memory (or cheat by watching the video). It would be nice if the answer was in some reference, so people could learn to use that too.",4
27186,Awesome course covering fundamental concepts!!,4
27207,Excellent Course but i was expecting some more content !! its very good,4
27208,A lot of demo !,4
27214,"Loving this course so far! Fairly in-depth, yet still easy to follow. Lecturer is easy on the ears and keeps one captivated",4
27227,"Really good course with useful information and case studies. Introduced new concepts that I was unfamiliar with. However, a few of the lectures were a bit tedious and difficult to concentrate on.",4
27228,An important course to take given the current situation of climate change.,4
27232,"Pretty well presented through different views, sources and media. What could be improved upon is putting some effort into tying the disparate parts together and making a coherent course that flows seamlessly from part to part and shows how everything is connected to each other.",4
27233,Good introductory course. I felt the wording of some of the quiz questions to be uneccessarily ambigous.,4
27250,"Great broad introduction, with links to resources for deeper investigation.",4
27253,Nice course. Learnt a lot on topic. Eye opening.,4
27261,"great course, clear and dinamic.",4
27267,Really liked the peer review process.,4
27268,A useful elementary course.,4
27280,I really enjoyed this course and definitely recommend it. The instructor was great. I am removing one star because I feel that it needs a little bit more of real problem solving and a small amount more of mathematical derivations.,4
27282,Complex. Bu,4
27285,Very interesting course. Thanks Professor Larry DeBrock!!,4
27286,It is well organized.,4
27291,Really good course!,4
27299,Please unlock case solutions in advance so we can assess our peers correctlyOtherwise great class with great references to other videos as well,4
27307,"Good course. Coming from a traditional art historical context/content. Which is still a very valuable methodology in this age of ""Visual Culture""! Thank you.",4
27309,I learned a lot from this course! I loved how analytical it was and it was great to learn about the historical contexts of gender on the canvas. It has already made some of my museum visits much more interesting and thought-provoking. I will say that at times it would be difficult to follow the lecturers is the only issue I had with this course. Otherwise it was awesome.,4
27312,Very well illustrated and organized course. Points made very clearly. Good learning experience.,4
27314,I'm really enthused with the lesson cause I feel I had a general view before about this subject and now I m approaching the core. It;s been an issue that I was thinking a lot the last 2 years.,4
27316,"I really enjoyed this course. An added bonus--I now understand what ""sensibility"" really means as related to the novel, Sense & Sensibility"" by Jane Austen. I hope this team comes up with a part 2 or another class.",4
27325,The course is very interesting but includes essentials and basic principles only! That is why 4/5. But in terms of quality it's 5/5 only!,4
27332,this is a useful course,4
27333,"It was a useful course. A pity that the instructor makes so many mistakes when speaking, which makes sometimes a bit confusing to follow.",4
27334,"More in-depth explanation would be better. Reasonable projects, overall. Well structured.",4
27335,"Thanks for the great course. IT was just right level of easiness/hardness. While the quizzes were basic, the homework quizzes were hard but not unsolvable. These actually motivated to further spend time on familiarizing with the tools, whch is essential for home usage.Sometimes the videos had their length when we watched somebody else typing... that could have made better.",4
27336,"Awesome course. The skills taught will cut across not only in genomics but also, in other aspects. The discussion forum was amazing! The mentors and people who were doing the course at the period i did it were very helpful.",4
27341,"Coming in as a veteran coder of 2 decades, I thought this would be ""easy"". And, had I completed it using my own C/Python code, it probably would have. However I made the decision to stick with ONLY the command line tools and actually ended up learning a lot more about basic unix tools that I rarely get to use.Be prepared to knuckle down and REALLY learn a lot about the specific commands and what they provide as there are a ton of them. The instructor goes into a ton of detail on each one and the course is laid out in a nice flow starting with the basics and ending with a very challenging exam at the end that showcases an entire RNA-seq technique.With a bit more polish, it would be 5 stars, but as it stands there is a bit rough around the edges.I think this course should be #2 in the specialization as the underlying concepts of RNA-seq and how the tools fit together would have been invaluable while taking the current #2 course on Galaxy. I think that I can now go back and get 100% on the final project armed with the RNA-seq techniques that were not originally covered in my first run through the Galaxy content.",4
27342,"Th lecturer could be a little more engaging and the materials used during classes, if made available would help following it better, by replicating the examples being shown.",4
27350,"This course covers used of command line tools such as the Tuxedo suite. Just what I was looking for. The subject was well paced and the material covered appropriate. I felt confident at the end of the course that I had almost mastered something valuable. The discussions were not very active and I felt rather isolated, so I'm taking one star off for engagement.",4
27359,Great insight into Sales forecasting. I liked it,4
27362,This course was very informative and gives an good knowledge of the basics of genetics.,4
27365,This course covered a lot of ground & will be a good jumping off point.,4
27381,"Really enjoy the course and thanks for sharing ! However, if the story line could be a little bit more clear, I think that will be more helpful for the process of learning.",4
27383,The course concludes the elementary knowledge of Game Theory. But it might be a little bit difficult for a new learner to grasp the key point. The lecture sometimes could be too much academic.,4
27385,"This course covers basic knowledge about Game Theory. But if you want to go deep on the topic, more efforts are needed beyond the course. It is good for beginners.",4
27390,The Questions in the weekend quizzes are not that challenging and the lectures are also not concentrated on complicated (Real life scenarios). Good for an Introductory course,4
27391,"Some of the material could have been re-recorded to remove the mistakes, but overall good work.",4
27392,"The course overall is good, with plenty of insights into game theory. However, I wish there could be more concrete examples for concepts such as Bayesian Equilibrium and core. The examples given are too special and is not in accordance with what is given in the exercise.Thanks for the lecturers and mentors!",4
27402,"An intriguing introduction to game theory, with a good number of resources and useful videos. Notes could do with better explicit explaining and more examples, but cross-referencing with the videos and putting in the work is more than enough. Definitely recommended.",4
27404,Good Course,4
27417,"This course is very basic and not intensive. Overall, it's good!",4
27418,"The topics that were explained very lucidly and clearly. The real-world examples helped develop an intuitive understanding of the course material. However, I think more topics could be covered in an additional few weeks.",4
27422,"Solid course. My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math/logic. Game theory is a math-heavy subject, and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math, a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols (from set theory, probability). It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas, but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch. Otherwise than that, the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching. I highly recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about game theory!",4
27427,"the course is really well organized but the mathematical skills are required for usual skip of steps by the teacher. if there are supplementary material, it would have been better!",4
27428,May be it is only my perception of education but I'd appreciate a lot if the course provides more examples and deep review at least for a few of them. But theoretically it was more than full and interesting.,4
27433,"Treat this course as a ""things you need to learn for a basic grasp of game theory"" and you'll love it. A bit rough if you don't have any set theory experience or math backgrounds; pick up some supplemental material from gametheory101 and you'll be fine.",4
27435,"In my opinion, some lectures do not fully explain the theory or do not show enough practical application of the theory. And I am not talking about ""real life application"", but the ones given later on the test. Had to refer to the internet on multiple occasions to fully understand the material.However, have to say, pretty good course overall. Give you the idea, of what type of knowledge one needs to ""understand"" the game theory. Help to build your mindset.",4
27437,It is necessary more examples for to understand more clearly the topics.,4
27440,"Great and clean outline of content, but more examples coupled with the theorems which are quite hard to understand will be better.",4
27442,"Actually, this course is a great one to take. Professors have explained these concepts and main ideas very clearly, therefore students can understand it very easily, even if they do not have previous knowledge about game theory. I want to say “thank you” to all the three professors for making such a concise and intelligible course.However, I would like to give some suggestions about this course. There is an obvious gap between the quizzes and graded assignments. Sometimes the quiz is very easy and it just requires you to have a basic understanding of the concept, while the assignment is even more difficult than the examples included in the videos. I think this course would be better if the staff can improve the difficulty gap between quizzes and assignments. And for people who want to enroll this course, an exercise book with detailed solution would be helpful for you to learn it better.As for the content of this course, there are lots of formulas from Week 5 to the end, which are a little difficult to understand. I fully understand this because math is always abstract, and formulation is an essential part of it. I think this problem can be solved by providing more ungraded quizzes for students to practice. They can have a better comprehension of the content through practicing.Anyway, this course is worth taking. Through learning it you will gain not only the knowledge about game theory, but also a new way to understand relationships around you. Happy learning!",4
27446,"A perfect introduction to game theory, especially the exercises make you think about the subject.",4
27447,"Had lots of fun doing this course. The lectures were all top quality and never bombarded us with too much information at once.Kudos to Kevin, Matt and Yoav for a memorable experience! :)",4
27456,"Really interesting course but I have some recomendations:1)I've missed that the professors would have done more example exercises on every lesson2)The value of the certificate to others (ie to find a job) is how hard is to pass the course or the minimum knowledge that the student adquires. The evaluation system makes it very easy to cheat (with 3 attemps every 8 hours for the practice sets or the exam). With test-type answers it is very easy to pass the course even if you haven't watched any lesson video or learnt anything.3) For point 2 I recommend that the check system on practice sets and the exam could be able to accept numeric or simbolic answers (not test-type) so that it will have infinite answers and nobody could cheat the system (in Edx I've done some courses that have this system). Another option could be that every attempt that you make substracted 10% on the calification of that practice set, so if you've already done the practice set twice you could only get 70% tops on the third attempt.Thanks to the staff!",4
27460,"I liked this course, but sometimes examples showed in the lectures were much easier than those you needed to solve in a quiz.",4
27469,Very good and useful course.,4
27471,"Great course, specially because of the professor, who has an incredible ability to explain it really simple so that you will understand concepts right away.",4
27473,"Short but complete course about project management, I like.",4
27475,Simple to understan for beginners in project m,4
27476,Very good course with clear explanations and good pace.I would add some more extra material to cover some aspects that are not given in deep during the course but overall is a really good course.,4
27480,The content was excellent but it requires a high interest/attention span on part of the students because very few teaching aids are used.,4
27490,"good class, watched all the lectures, just won't do peer review.",4
27506,I have really learn a lot through the participation of the course and would like to sincerely thank the people conducting the course to make the course so enriching and also interesting.,4
27507,"The material is good, but the format of the case study submission has allowed numerous cases of cheating and plagiarism.",4
27526,"Only a more large, and longer course, would be better, it's a great course.",4
27531,"The content of the course is very interesting. The final task could be more ambitious, however - just to inspire greatness.",4
27534,"Great course, but simplistic.",4
27538,Very good. Very useful,4
27545,very interesting,4
27547,"I thought the course had good overall information and provided an online mapping tool using ArcGIS despite access and technical issues which I recorded in the forums. I felt getting rushed at the end of the course for the major map project and peer review and final exam all in the last week. The map project itself should be Week 3, peer review Week 4, then final exam Week 5. All students should use the same ArcGIS Online too for the final map project, instead of allowing everybody a free-for-all to use whatever map tool they wanted to including images. I was steered to be more lenient in reviewing submissions of simple PDF or image map without interactive content. This made for an awkward and rushed peer review with little time to address access or technical issues. The final map project should be standardized for all students using ArcGIS Online for an equal playing field and applied learning.",4
27565,simply interesting,4
27568,Dr. Boyd is very engaging and his graphics are helpful to guide you along. I also love the variety of guest speakers that appear in his class!,4
27569,Really good!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
27587,it was great but weeks 4 and 5 should be a lot more challenging and cover more topics.,4
27595,great and useful,4
27616,a quite practical course for DP and ER.,4
27623,It is indeed a wonderful learning experience especially with respect to using practical tips and tricks for disaster preparedness,4
27624,Very helpful to know different perspective of disaster,4
27625,the course is great. also I would like to thank coursera for the fee-waiver opportunities without which people like me could never afford to take such high quality and up to date trainings!,4
27628,"Interesting study, it covered things that I all ready knew but also presented others that I had not considered. Overall a good place to begin.",4
27629,It could go a little more quicker into the Medical aspect but otherwise very good.,4
27631,Amazing practical information. I would have appreciated more showing of the water purification system.,4
27633,Excellent Course. Everyone should take this course.,4
27635,"Very good course, but sometimes goes into too much detail for things that are quite common sense.",4
27636,"An engaging and highly informative course. My only concern is that the required reading was not available, and there were several broken links for optional reading. This needs to be looked at and repaired as soon as possible.",4
27637,"The course was informative, but seemed to be geared towards individuals not accustom to survival situations. I would enjoy taking a more advanced, in depth program.However, the course was clear and I enjoyed the assignments. Some of the quiz questions were based off of information which may have meant more to the instructor than it was significant to the students.",4
27641,"informative course, although I found the assignment to be somewhat redundant and insulting to the student's intelligence. It's common sense that anyone what automatically know to make a list of survival items and an escape strategy in a disaster situation!",4
27648,"Kind Regards,Reasonable for target audience, good self awareness review and expansion of cultural and professional base.",4
27657,Very well presented course. Enjoyable and informative.,4
27660,Than You so much this course has really influenced my life at such great heightsIt has also made me give more recognition to our Bible Family for all their great accomplishments.,4
27662,good course,4
27677,"I disliked really slow speed of formulas derivation, simple operations like cancelling out terms are done in multiple steps. Like for children that only starting study mathematics. Otherwise great course!",4
27678,"Very good introductory course, clear and well designed, with a nice emphasis on the key concepts of the special theory of relativity. The mathematical background required is very light, hence the quantitative analysis of various examples and situations is limited.",4
27682,Good course for introduction to special relativity. I expected more related to E=mc^2 derivation.,4
27695,Not much of mathematical inclination. But the Prof. is really of high standard and he makes sure that you understand everything by the end of any topic as he will run by each topic more than once. Its an introductory course but induces a great amount of interest to learn more!,4
27713,"This was a great course which is taught by a passionate and patient lecturer. The whole 8 weeks covers the first half of Einstein's famous paper in detail. The pace can be slow, but of course you can always speed up the videos. The mathematics is very approachable - school level algebra is all you need. The only other prerequisite is a basic understanding of light and electromagnetic waves.",4
27729,"A comprehensive introduction to the subject, somewhat spoiled by the unrelenting reiteration of the most basics concepts in the earlier parts of the course. A bit of a pity, since the lecturer is a fairly engaging speaker when he is not busy interrupting the flow of his argument with mind–numbing repetition.",4
27731,"This course is superb, covers easyly all the aspects of the special theory of relativity",4
27735,Very in Depth for if it is your first time learning. If you have already read about General and Special Relativity it doesn't tell you very much more than what you already know. Either way it is a great course.,4
27750,Good for beginners. Do all assignments even if its optional.,4
27751,Very useful classes,4
27759,"I loved the course, it really help me a lot to understand Graphic Design and to find inspiration in the things that surround us, which mostly are composed of basic geometric shapes.",4
27784,Very well conceived and useful! A great intro to Graphic Design.,4
27803,"Good introduction to graphic design. The videos have a lot of ""mouth noises"".",4
27805,I learned some stuff and this was one of the easier courses I have taken.,4
27807,This Course has opened my eyes to different simple concepts I had forgotten or not quiet understood until now. I am going to work through all of the 5 coursed for Graphic design. this was a great start.,4
27815,Good basic introduction to the topic.,4
27820,"I really loved this course, it really pushes you forward to create and it is a really good course for beginners. I would only love for the review part to be morechallenging in order to get better at your work in the future",4
27828,"learn a lot of fundamental information about graphic design, and really do a great help for me to learn a designer's view.",4
27840,Great examples and excercises. A good way to get into the graphic design. I enjoy every assignment and it gives a lot of ways to keep doing graphic design.,4
27852,"I found the course rather interesting and useful for the beginners in graphic design, however I think the students need the feedback from the instructor. I missed some professional critic during the course.",4
27863,This course sets a decent foundation for anybody interested in pursuing graphic design seriously.,4
27868,I was hoping they would taught me softwares in order to do my assignments,4
27871,"Very basic introduction to the ground floor of Graphic Design. Get in, get it done, get out. I like how precise it was.",4
27890,Great overview of graphic design for someone who does not have any experience in this area. Encourages creativity and new ways of thinking about every day objects and representations.,4
27898,Really Good,4
27899,"very important for both new designer, who want to enrich their knowledge, and experienced designers, as a refresher.",4
27903,Very basic but important knowledge.,4
27912,Good explanation and very basic,4
27932,"I didn't really liked the course of the first week but than I really came to enjoy a lot the course about pattern and forms in particular which was a completely new way of thinking how to create for me, very interesting and full of possibilities.",4
27933,"A decent course, but flawed by student reviewers with subjective opinions.",4
27935,Overall great course. Some knowledge Adobe Illustrator and file formatting needed.The Audio is out of sink from the video on many lessons.,4
27944,"IT IS A GOOD BASIC COURSE IN DESIGN, NICE FOR EXPERIMENTING.",4
27945,Very basic information but a good beginner's course.,4
27948,"This is a great course for all-time beginners to learn about the most fundamental principles of design. It is not, however, so much a compelling course if you have any notion about design in general or color as it is as bare-bones as it can get. I have really liked the lectures though, and the projects, though they could have been a little bit more challenging, were good examples of a real-life practice.",4
27953,Its a great course to start understanding the basics of design and know what graphic design is all about. the lectures are very well explained and the assignments are all very easy to complete.Its a very well structured course.,4
27954,Very good introductory course to Graphic Design. A good staple to get familiar with the very basics before starting learning more.,4
27963,Over all a good experience to get a solid understanding of basic graphic design aspects.,4
27970,"Some of the videos seem a little repetitive, but all in all it was a great overview of Graphic Design. T",4
27971,"As a self taught person in Graphic Design, it was interesting to put words to my basic knowledge. I found particularly helpful the lesson about composition.",4
27973,"A lot of the material given in the lecture was intuitive, but I thought it was extremely valuable to see all of the different examples the instructor showed, and the peer review process was also helpful (not only to get feedback on your own work, but to see the way all your classmates approached the same prompt)",4
27976,Enjoyed it.,4
27998,Great way to get acquainted with the basic tools of graphic design. I will be sure to use them next time I am creating a presentation at work or in my personal life.,4
28000,"It's described as ""fundamentals"" and that's it. Very basic. Everything is well explained. In my opinion, it could be a little more in depth.",4
28005,Excellent introduction to graphic design. The instructor is engaging and interesting and the topics are broken down into easy to understand segments with excellent examples. Assignments are interesting and really helped me work with the different topics.,4
28007,Its a good course for people who never look at design but its a lot surface. Of course if you want to know the main aspects of design very quikly it course for you.,4
28012,"A very good introduction to this specialization, with fun and thought-provoking exercisees.",4
28034,The instruction videos are pretty good. The course gives a good overview of the fundamentals. It delivers what it promises.,4
28035,A very good course and has helped understand a lot about The said subject :),4
28039,Awesome course,4
28047,"simple and easy to complete it, powerful information covering multi topics of graphic design ....but still need more declaration of tasks . thanks",4
28049,"A great course to learn to design. It's not a software course, which is perfect. Just what I needed it. Unfortunately, it's too short.",4
28055,"I thoroughly enjoyed the class. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because, I would have liked to have seen one of the design projects reviewed by the teacher or a teacher's assistant. I appreciate the peer review, but hearing from someone with experience can be very reassuring.",4
28056,"I really enjoy the exploration journey of this course!Especially the moto of the tutor : ""The best part to create it's to have fun in the process!""...Thanks a lot!",4
28072,A very precise and interesting overview into the world of design and graphics.,4
28073,Good explanations and great tasks to accomplish. Really didactic.,4
28093,"This is a great intro course for anybody new to the subject. I look forward to expanding my knowledge with the base of information provided here. I also really loved the assignments and the deadlines; I've been trying to learn the fundamentals on my own, but having the structure of this class really helped me to make progress.",4
28101,"Covers the topic very well, but keep in mind that it's only an intro. The focus is on introducing concepts and language.",4
28107,"Good course. Interesting clear lectures and interesting, enjoyable assignments.",4
28108,"Very interesting and well done course. If I can suggest, we should have feedback from the professors on our assignments. If this is something impossible, considered the huge amount of persons applying for the course, he should at least check some work and give a feedback in order for us to understand if the works done are made in a correct way or not.",4
28109,"It has been 40 years since I took my last art course (and that was in elementary school). While I enjoyed making posters in high school and college, those were done by hand. I had ZERO experience with computer graphics, and was quite nervous starting this course. I liked the way the instructor eased into it - bringing less experienced artists along slowly, and constantly encouraging us to practice and experiment. By the 4th week, I figured out my computer's basic graphic design program, and was really enjoying playing with designs. I look forward to taking the other classes in this specialization.",4
28117,"The material is really good for beginners. In order to make it more useful I think all the tasks should be mandatory, there shouldn't be any optional ones",4
28124,"The materials and knowledge of the fundamentals from this course are helpful. However, the assignments and peer grading threw me off. I did not like the fact that your grade depended on students' review of your assignments. It is all subjective. Good course materials, poor grading system.",4
28131,The course itself was great. The only thing lacking is that all the assignments were reviewed only by peers.,4
28133,"Clear teaching line and complete content makes it a wonderful choice for starters who are interested in graphic design. However, as the name of the course indicates, it is not an advanced tutorial for those who wants to enhance their design skills in a more specific area.",4
28135,Great introduction of the fundementals of graphic design! I recommend it - the videos and instructor are clear and concise. I look forward to the next course in the specialization.,4
28142,Maybe too basic sometimes. But the teacher explains everything in a very good way. The platform works amazingly.,4
28144,"I loved the course, although I think the instructions for various briefs should be more precise and/or someone should be available to clarify the instructions and answer any questions from students (regarding the briefs).",4
28153,"Information was very good and presented in a clear and intriguing manner. I do wish the professors or someone could give some oversight. Some students were nice, but some were very nasty to each other. Ironically, the people with the worst work were the nastiest.",4
28156,I enjoyed the course as a,4
28157,"An excellent introduction to graphic design. The videos were useful to clearly show the concepts. There were a number of assignments, many of them optional, which allowed you to practice and integrate the learnings. All material was taught at a level that made it accessible to a true novice.My only hesitation on giving this course 5 stars was the lack of any presence of teachers/tutors in the course discussions. There was a lot of questions about the final marked assignment, with many posts on the discussion boards. There was no response from anyone other than the participants in the course. The issue was not clarified and students were left to interpret (and peer review based on that intrepretation) the instructions on their own.",4
28164,Explanations are simple but covers many aspects. The assignments are also simple but quite useful to practice what it is explained in the video lesson. I really enjoy with this course and creating the composition suggested in the assignments.,4
28167,IT's a nice introduction into the design world. I enjoyed it.,4
28168,This had some really good fundamentals and some really helpful exercises. I recommend this to anyone who would like to understand a little more about Graphic Design.,4
28170,The strongest part of this course is that it prompts the learners to apply the designing skills.,4
28173,"The course was very interesting, hands on orientated and it offered me a lot of useful information. I have really enjoyed it! It was also a good motivation to practice graphic design more often, explore the realms of shapes, colours, typography etc.I was really grateful for the peer reviews, but I missed a bit more professional approach sometimes, for instance comments like ""I like it"" or ""It is not that bad"" does not tell me much about my work. So in these cases some feedback from someone who already is a graphic designer and knows much more about it than us, students, starting with the graphic design, would be more than welcome.I also missed advices on where to find out more on a particular topic.Overall, taking this course was a very positive experience and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in graphic design.",4
28183,"This course is a good start in understanding the basics of graphic design, I felt it could go a bit deeper into the materials but its a good beginniing :)",4
28188,"I would like if there was some instructor feedback. That would be great! I loved the course, really useful.",4
28205,Great intro course!,4
28210,Simple and clear enough for beginners.,4
28215,Great introduction course. I wish there were links to relevant literature on the topics. Some exercise formulations are not instantly clear.,4
28221,"It is a great course, simple yet complete. However, it would be nice if we had more contact with our lecturers, and if they graded our assignments instead of other classmates. They are not as experienced as our teachers are.",4
28228,"Course is pretty good as a starting point. Makes you start thinking on different lines and gives a good introduction about the various aspects involved. Getting reviews from other students also helped a lot.So overall, i quite enjoyed the course. Thumbs Up!! :)",4
28235,Assignments could be more fun and hard but the course was very good.,4
28250,"ProsThe information is good. This class is good for learning the vocabulary in graphic design. I already understood more general terms like scale and form. I learned new terms like figure/ground and visual contrast (or how graphic design defines it).ConsThe teacher's pace for some of the videos is slow for the amount of information. On week 4, the pace slightly quickens. But overall, it's really slow.VerdictI would recommend this course for learning the terms of graphic design or getting a basic understanding of design principles. I also found the assignments fun. If you have some understanding of the basics of design and art, you do not need to watch every video. Feel free to skip on videos covering terms you have a general idea about.",4
28255,Its taught very nicely and its an eye opener. :),4
28257,Although very basic the course helped my to discover the bases of graphic design. Willing for more!,4
28260,Nice class. Quite inspiring at times.,4
28262,I learn a lot about graphic design and I'm eager to learn more,4
28272,"I loved this course, even though (for me), some things were quite repetitive and unnecessarily lengthy.",4
28274,Really good course. I would have given it 5 stars but it could use a little improvement. Too many optional assignments perhaps. They should have been required. The class just didn't engage you enough. That being said I've signed up for the next ones.,4
28279,"Four stars, because there is always room for improvement. But this is a well structured course and gives a great grounding for anyone looking at graphic design.Thanks to those who put this course together, great work.",4
28280,The course is pretty good and not difficult to take. I've learned basic graphic design skill via this course. Looking forward to taking more classes here again!,4
28297,"I was unable to follow up bc of vacation and some busines travel, I wish to do it again one day.",4
28302,I think this course was great- it really got you exploring and experimenting. I do think that there should be more REQUIRED briefs. Two of the modules out of the four were quiz's which was a little disappointing. I also think there needs to be some online help. In the last brief there was a large discussion as a lot of students were confused about the task and nobody stepped up to help clear the air- this is the reason I gave this course 4 not 5 stars.,4
28308,"Hey, that's pretty good.",4
28310,I'm really excited to complete this course and have a better understanding of graphic design!,4
28312,"The fundamentals, like the title says. Very well explaineI wish there was more info on what software to use for the assignments for those of us more used to traditional mediums rather than digital.",4
28314,"this course taught me a lot about graphic design. i was so astonished about all the meanings from composition, shape and color. nice for beginners",4
28320,The professor is great. That is the best part of this course.,4
28322,"Great course that teaches you what you need for graphic design.It is a good approach to graphic design.The reviewing system encourages you to talk to your ""classmates"", there is a very friendly atmosphere.However, it is a bit difficult to get feedback from the institute and the teacher direclty.",4
28329,"Very helpful, I love it!It would have been 5 stars if it had been longer.",4
28343,Amazing classes to create some interest over the graphic design! I finished and aprove.,4
28349,Notes made available would have been very handy.,4
28357,"This course was very well designed and extremely suitable for peeps of all backgrounds. I suppose the only drawback was that I didn't find the course challenging enough. But I went to design school for a few semesters, so I was already pretty familiar with the concepts. Overall, very good practice and a nice refresher. Thanks, Michael!",4
28361,The course is being great so far and very well taught/instructed by Professor Michael. I hope it will be an important asset to my future career in Arts.,4
28375,Michael (the lecturer) did a wonderful job delivering the lessons in an easy to understand manner. The whole course was easy to follow. I don't recall any ambiguity in his teachings and his voice was clear. I also enjoy some of the assignments because I surprise myself by producing some great images. My main problem is the instructions of the assignments that causes a lot of students to be confused (there are many complaints expressed in the Discussion forum).,4
28380,"The course introduces you to the vital basics of graphic design. Sometimes the information provided is not enough for me as a practicing designer, but I guess it would be OK for beginners. Maybe the main thing about the course is that it constantly encourages students to do a lot of design, and it's definitely inspiring.",4
28387,Videos explain very well all the contents.,4
28394,Very good to understand the basics of graphic design,4
28414,Great entry level course! Big thanks to Michael Worthington!,4
28424,A very detailed course with good analysis frameworks.,4
28428,Very Good!!!,4
28432,"I think it's a great effort for presenting us all this research, videos, activities, etc. but sometimes is heavy, boring, long, I think you could resume de course, so we don't loss interest. Thanks a lot anyway!",4
28441,"very good, interesting, you can apply the learned lessons in your daily life from the first day",4
28468,"I can see the hard work of Prof. Raj and his team. More of cognitive inputs are there please try putting more tools, tricks and techniques to be more happy. Thanks.",4
28491,Prof. Raj teaches the course well.,4
28503,"Overall, this course contains some great, potentially life-changing advice. I would definitely recommend it. It loses one star for the production values of the videos (lots of stock photography, annoying sounds) and the unnecessary length of the instructional videos for the assignments.",4
28527,"Great course but there are too many videos (maybe they can be zipped into one longer video instead of four to five short ones) and readings and I think this course should have more practice, more exercises, more field activities.",4
28544,It was a nicely designed course. Though I believe it could have been made more compact.,4
28552,An excellent course! Inspirational and educational. Highly recommended!,4
28556,"I was scepticale at first but Raj explained all sides to his ideas so well that I had to keep watching. Every time I thought of important questions, he'd explain it 1 minute later. The only concern for me personaly was that he choose creative wordings over clarity & simplicity. I also aticipated better strategies and explainations to sin #5 for toxic people, psych pain, accountability but besides this everything else was beyond expectations.",4
28567,"The course is very detailed. The theories and philosophy is supported by lot of research, talks by expert. The course is overall has lots to offer, the only improvement needed is on the aspect that it seems like a very theory driven and a serious course, the fun part is missing in it.The orator of the course has immense knowledge and does offer lot of take aways. I actually would have named the course as Scientific method & theories to achieve happiness.",4
28583,Great!!!!!,4
28587,Very interesting and engaging course,4
28596,"Rich, great and intense course. Be aware of the implication of the students before enrolling in order to be stressed about the exercice that need you to work / think of it every week.Thank you for the content which is really rich.",4
28613,I am really enjoying this course. Its so nicely planned out and put together. Prof Raj speaks so eloquently thats easy to follow him. I love the way instructions are provided to submit the assignments. In other coursera courses I have mostly quit because of the lack of proper instructions during the assignments and also additional help. Not this one.What I dont like is the pop up quiz. Its not that the quiz is bad but the pop up destroys the flow of the topic. You could have executed the quiz just like the polls where there is a pause by the Prof and then comes the quiz. It would ensure a coherence in the videos.But overall a great course.,4
28619,Interesting and insightful course indeed,4
28630,"Lots of interesting information & exercises in this course, plus an enthusiastic teacher. Very enjoyable.",4
28637,Great course,4
28639,I learned a lot. Now to keep on practicing.,4
28648,Excellent course for first responders and those who just want to know how to react in an emergency,4
28653,"Excellent course content, a little longwinded on the videos, and therefore more diffuse than it needs to be, however a hugely important topic, and presented multidimensionally in a way that draws in the latest research as well as ancient wisdom .The happiness framework gives a clearcut way of action-ing Happiness hacks into ones life. Even the apparently simple task of Defining Happiness makes it clear how we are unclear & confused about happiness, to the extent that we keep measuring the wrong metrics.Ones that could never result in happiness!",4
28656,"This course provided an insight to the ultimate aim of human life - Happiness. In order to reach that dream, you need to take certain actions, it speaks about those. More than anything, it urges you to be open minded to everything.",4
28670,great course,4
28697,The lectures were interesting and insightful and the practical assignments were very helpful.,4
28707,Good course.,4
28709,"The content it has been very exciting, dynamic and enjoyable. I like how the information is structured and all the sources from professionals are gathering together. Great class for everybody! definitely much more than a Happy Life course. The only thing I don't love about it is the music introduction in every session, which for me is a little too cheese.",4
28728,"I am definitely enjoying Professor Raj, a fellow Texan :-) . I enjoy the guest Skype segments and the book suggestions. I like the Budda quote and the cartoons. Suggestions for improvement.... Make fewer, but longer videos. In my opinion, I lose learning time by watching so many short videos, because each video has the opening animation and closing credits. Also, there really is no need to have someone else give the assignment, she is beautiful and pleasant, but it's distracting and her audio is different than yours, so when wearing ear buds, she sometimes blows my ears up, she's so loud. Would be interested in seeing what else Professor Raj teaches on line.",4
28736,"I liked it a lot. Not sure I learned a whole lot new, but isn't it so helpful to spend 6 weeks immersed in practice? I think so! He clearly had way more info than he could go through in six weeks -- you could tell by the number of guest speakers, extra research students could do. He did a great job condensing and picking out the most basic and core elements. A lot of group effort -- first course I've taken where I've seen how MANY people were involved in pulling it off....",4
28739,"Thank you! I enjoyed the content and learning more about happiness. I found the music a wee bit corny, though.",4
28740,"This is probably my fourth course at Coursera. And the first one I could complete properly. I have had to leave the rest because of the time and effort they asked for, and for a working professional, it's just that much harder to give in so many hours!With this course, I feel at ease watching the lectures and felt the tension melt away rather than having an add on pressure. The best part is that I finished this course within 4 weeks rather than the stipulated 6 weeks(which shows how good Dr. Raj is, kudos to him!)The only thing I felt missing was a sense of feedback from the professors, like in a real classroom. When people indulge themselves in courses involving such vigour and enthusiasm, they expect to find a feedback from the professor as well. Maybe a sense of real time involvement. But then again, I'll congratulate Dr. Raj and the team at ISB for making such a brilliant course. I have already made many of my friends sign up for this!Cheers.",4
28742,Good fun & very thought-provoking.Deductions for sometimes lousy sound quality of videos and inane placing of quizzes.,4
28748,"A very good course. My only suggestions would be to extend the course for a week or even two. The time and amount of work needed to complete the last week's assignments were inconsistent with the other weeks. To have done my best with the final quiz and assignment, I should have spent a significant amount of time reviewing material from previous weeks.",4
28774,Good Course,4
28777,Interesting class with many useful ideas and techniques.,4
28786,Lectures are short and engaging. Good info. Great prof! Would like a little more evidence for some of the concepts presented but overall GREAT!,4
28791,"Very good, practical, just to the point, with lots of quotes and evidence on studies that suppport course affirmations. Really enjoyable!",4
28793,Very interesting course! I would suggest making the explanation for the exercises shorter.,4
28797,"The course was great, it was really interesting and fun. But the final exam was somewhat lackluster, writing it was not even close to enjoyable",4
28806,"So far, so good! Just about to start week 2 of this course and it has been good so far.",4
28832,"The Course seems to be a great one and the way it has been delivered is fantastic...Although, I know there is a lot of content to be covered to make it really impactful but I felt the duration is just a bit longer than expected.",4
28857,"Good course , For Living more better",4
28860,Very interesting!!!!,4
28870,Great!,4
28898,This course was fun and it re-opened my eyes and mind to how happy life can be if we remove/ take control of our own mental obstacles.I would recommend to anyone who's cup isn't full.,4
28913,I loved this course and enjoyed it.,4
28917,"the contents of the course were very good. It is essential material that everyone should learn about as early as possible in their life. It should be essential learning in each school. All the material is based on scientific facts. there are, however, reasons why I did not rate this course with 5 points. The amount of material takes a lifetime to digest and adopt. To cram this into a few weeks was not the appropriate way to teach it. there were way too many videos one was supposed to watch within a single week. Sometimes even the summary videos for a single week took 20 minutes. That is just not right. I was so busy memorizing the material that I did not find the time to adopt it in my daily life. what a pity. it will take me many months to really digest the material",4
28918,"I've taken about 70 MOOCs across multiple platforms. Of those 70, I've completed about 12. Of those 12, about 4 were good. This is one of those four. Sometimes the videos were a little long, but the work was inspired and the science behind the content was great. I did every assignment (rare for a MOOCer, as you probably know). This was totally worth my time. I hope you find it to be worth yours. Enjoy!",4
28925,Its a good class but a little fast paced. The teacher is enthusiastic and energized.,4
28954,Very warm and interesting course which does make an impact on your Happiness levels,4
28978,"A life of Happiness and Fulfilment has been a real great experience, a time I could offer myself to explore and dig deep into happiness.I think Prof. Raj plays a huge role in motivating participants to move forward, even the more suspicious about the value of compassion, mindfulness, loving care.Prof. Raj teaches with passion and always finding balance between being and acting professional but I am so grateful Prof Raj knows he can dance, and tell us jokes, be super friendly and yet be his perfect ""self"".Thank you prof. Raj, I enjoyed your classes and the guests you brought to us.Alohaf!",4
28981,A little tough but very interesting. A must for everyone!,4
28982,It really boost the happiness level in life and really a great guide in handling the complex situations and circumstances...,4
28983,Because all of us owe it to ourselves to be a bit happier than we are now. I'm finding this class is allowing me to give myself permission to be happy. This is making a difference in my daily life. I laugh more often & louder.,4
28997,"Made me feel more happy, so I would recommend it",4
29004,A welcome change....Brilliant concept in the world of technology and data crunching this course makes it so easier to detach to materialistic things and follow your heart and do what you really like....,4
29005,Fantastic and fun!,4
29010,awesome course,4
29017,Engaging videos. Clear path with easy to follow directions for practices,4
29019,Very good and inspiring course!,4
29041,"A very engaging, enriching and pragmatic course on happiness and positive psychology.",4
29042,"Excellent course ,gives great insights of life and how to being happy.",4
29050,I loved it!!! It help me a lot to understand what happiness really is to me!!,4
29054,"Well presented and interesting course, I've taken some great points from this that I hope to integrate into my day to day life.I didn't feel there was much value in the self assessments, perhaps there are a Coursea requirement?",4
29065,"Thanks, I really enjoyed this course.",4
29077,"wonderful course one of its kind, very beautiful and effective presentation, smooth flow , life changing content",4
29083,"it is great, only having problems with finding quizzes and the app. the rest is what I was in need of",4
29092,"This was a very good course and it offered many reasons why people aren't happy and techniques on how to change. There were some instances where it was confusing and/or the information was too segmented. I liked that the videos were short, but sometimes that contributed to the segmentation of a lesson. I would recommend this course to others.",4
29093,Nice one. Since it gives some confidence to advance.,4
29106,The course was informative and I really enjoyed through out.,4
29109,"This course is excellent and well taught. You will learn fascinating facts about how dogs think, the importance of social skills as a dimension of cognition, and much more",4
29113,"Solid entry level course to dog cognition. I would have preferred that it focused more strongly on dogs, and payed less attention to how information about dogs can help us understand humans. The section on general domestication was phenomenal, and the bonobo to chimp comparisons were incredibly helpful. I would have appreciated deeper analysis on what each of the five cognitive domains for dognition were, and what they actually meant.",4
29116,"The material is interesting, if not all that novel, but the professor is incredibly repetitive and boring to listen to...to the point where the lectures were almost redundant, and if the content had not been so interesting to me I would have greatly disliked it",4
29117,This class was full of great information and is really cool for any animal lover especially dogs!,4
29118,"Intersteing thing to know about the dogs that dognition ""method"". I liked Brian Hare as good communicator.",4
29131,A lot of information and joy .I do recommend it.,4
29132,"This course was short and interesting. Maybe the presenter tried a little too much to sell his book but I still watched until the end and found out many new things that I now notice with my dog! I really think this helpted me understand my dog in a different way, but I do wish there had been more studies/facts about dogs (longer course I guess). I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about how dogs think.",4
29140,"The course is nice introduction to the study of dogs behaviour, with easy to follow lectures and exercises, after finishing you understand that dogs are smarter than we think.",4
29145,"Great information, slower to get to the real goals of the course until the second half of it.",4
29157,"Well presented interesting information, reasonable quiz questions (though some were not phrased in an easy to understand way. Highly recommended for those with a interest in dogs learning and training.",4
29169,"-An absolutely fantastic course, very highly recommend it to anybody who owns a dog. My only complaint is that in week 5, the teacher gets quite a bit overboard into all of evolution. There is no need for this, because the course is on Dog EMOTION and COGNITION, not primate and human evolution. I felt I was a captive audience for his own unnecessary preaching on primate evolution. The best example I can give is the classic times when a person would invite you over for dinner only to sell Amway. Other than that, the course was wonderful! Great teacher.",4
29179,this course was very interesting and fun. It's unbelievable how dogs are amazing and how we just took them for granted and didn't even know!! Lucky you you came to the right place; Dr Hare will teach you all that. this course is really well made and will teach you a lot about the basics and way more. I highly recommand it.,4
29181,"I really liked this course. It was really fun. I learned a lot and I will put it to good use with my dog, Boomer. I also haven't got a chance to do Dognition so I will try to do it, It sounds so fun!",4
29187,Wonderful logical explanation of the new dog cognition theory. I'm excited to see how this knowledge & research will affect dog training in the future.,4
29189,I really liked this course!,4
29190,"Great insight into the research done at Duke and around the world. Could use more focus on raw data and experimental designs although what was presented seemed fair for a course trying to reach a broad audience, including non scientists.",4
29192,"It is a very interesting course. Does not tell you how to train your dogs but makes you understand the way dogs, human, great apes and other species think and solve problems which is very interesting.",4
29193,"This was a good course. The lectures were a good length, they were interesting and very easy to understand. The lecturer was articulate and easy to follow. I liked the way the readings supported the course and the dognition stuff will be really useful. The citizen science material was also interesting. A useful and practical course that was fun and interesting to do.",4
29197,The course was fun and very informative. It made me more aware of what my dog was in historical and evolutionary terms and made me more appreciative of him in general. But it did not translate to actual things I could do with my dog and did not give me any real understanding of his reactions.,4
29207,"I learned a great deal from this class and Dr. Hare did a remarkable job teaching the course. The reason I gave four stars instead of five is because Dr. Hare continued to promote his book and Dognition, to the point that some lectures began to sound more like advertisements. Besides that it was a wonderful experience, and I have no doubt the knowledge gained will be useful in my own work with dogs.",4
29210,Very interesting information about dogs that's also a 'myth burster' of sorts for me. Dr. Hare 's video's were not only well made but also well spaced. I found a few quiz questions difficult to understand even though I paid close attention to all lessons. But hey- I passed the final quiz in first attempt so Its all good! Thanks Dr. Hare & Duke University for making this 'different' course available!!,4
29212,Interesting and useful!,4
29217,I didn't come away with much understanding of how dogs think - I don't have much experience with dogs and I was hoping to learn about how to have a good relationship with a dog before I decide whether to get one - but the science is fascinating and I am glad I took the class anyway.,4
29225,"Very informative, unfortunately Dr. Hare had a lot of filler words (ah, umm) in his videos, but typically receded towards the later part of the videos. As opposed to other reviews I do not feel like the incorporation of his book and website burdened the lecture, many professors in universities use their own book for their courses and I feel like Dognition would greatly help students be engaged in the course, they do have a couple games on their Youtube page if you want a taste before purchasing Dognition. I feel like this lecture has more to do with cognition than with emotion, and unfortunately I went into this lecture thinking it would be more about dog psychology. So don't dive into this course thinking you'll know a lot about dog psychology as emotion and cognition are just parts of psychology but it'll definitely give you some insightful information on dog cognition.",4
29226,"interesting course with new insights which will change your perspectives on the evolution theory of dogs as well as general cognition. People exaggerated about the book comment, yes it is mentioned, but not ad nausium",4
29227,I haven't completely finished this course yet but so far so good! Great information; presented very clearly and keeps you interested.,4
29232,I chose to take this course on Dog Emotion and Cognition as it reminds me of doing my volunteer work at Peace of Mind Dog Rescue.,4
29234,"For anyone that has lived with a dog, much of this content will be common knowledge. The value is the scientific and technical studies done to validate those assumptions.",4
29238,Little high on the scientific data,4
29243,I was expecting this course to be just about dogs. It was still interesting. Thank you.,4
29270,It is very helpful to get a better understanding of dogs....,4
29272,Detailed and insightful course delivered in a very engaging manner.,4
29282,Good beginning level class and a nice reminder of how complex learning really is.,4
29284,It was a lot of fun!,4
29295,"Excellent, I learned alot",4
29299,very good and easy to follow learnt a lot,4
29316,Really interesting stuff. I was a little concerned after watching week 1 & 2 that I would know most of the material already but in week 3 things really started to pick up and now that I am finished all the lectures I am so glad to have taken this course!!!,4
29324,Great class!,4
29327,So much interesting,4
29332,Veryh fun and interesting class. I learned a lot.,4
29340,It was very interesting and classes were fun to watch.,4
29349,"The material is so interesting that even though you're learning a lot, it doesn't feel like hard work. The only possible drawback is that it keeps referencing this citizen science (a similar concept to crowd sourcing or open-source) program called Dognition. Dognition's this website that allows you to play games with your dog that test its cognition, and uses the data from it to better understand how dogs think. You don't need Dognition to learn a lot and get a lot out of the course, but if you don't have a dog to play with or feel like spring for the fee (which again, are highly optional and not needed to learn from this course), you will miss out a bit. But other than that, it's fascinating to learn about how dogs think and how that's unique among the animal kingdom.",4
29367,I really enjoyed the material of this course. Well worth the money paid. I feel that I learned a lot. I definitely suggest reading the book also. The only issue I had with the course is that there were a couple times wording on the quizzes were incorrect/misleading,4
29394,Lots of fun and very inspiring. Like it,4
29395,"I like that is not only about dogs, but also on apes (including humans).Easy to listen to.Would love more articles or other reading materials in this course besides the book.",4
29398,The course was informative and enjoyable. I would have given it 5 stars if a free certificate of accomplishment were issued as in other courses.,4
29400,Brian provided a great course that informed and entertained. Good for those with many levels of animal interaction and familiarity.,4
29410,Intersting,4
29411,"The lecture make me understand more about my puppy, thank you",4
29413,Everybody who loves animals and who wants to understand better his/her pet should take this course. When you discover all your dog's potential you will be a better owner and a better person.,4
29415,Fun and informative learning experience,4
29417,"Very nice and informative course; it is perfect for people with very basic knowledge of biology, evolution and animal behavior. Maybe some aspects should have been treated in greater details to meet the needs of more advanced learners.",4
29419,should know,4
29420,The content was interesting but the lectures could have been taped in a more engaging manner.,4
29432,"I love some of the discussions in this course, and i think that students can be prompted to contribute even more. Perhaps make contributing to a discussion in each module an essential part of the course?The content is well-structured, going from a general overview of evolution to canine cognition. I would have liked to see it go even further, questioning the assumptions behind some of the recent research publications in this area instead of just including it in this course. A little more critical reasoning doesn't hurt.",4
29441,"I could give you 5 stars if you issue the Statement of Accomplishment to students who passed this course by free, at least... Anyway, the course was so great and interesting to me ! Thank you so mu",4
29443,"I found many interesting insights into how dogs became man's best friend and into dog cognition. However, some of the points were belabored far too long; in addition, problems in dog behavior--such as biting etc.--were not really dealt with at all. For me, the promise of knowledge of dogs leading to knowledge of self remained unfulfilled. I could also have used more practical insights into how a dog can be guided (trained) to become the ideal companion.",4
29444,"This is a fun course. However, there is not much content on dog emotion, and lots on evolution (not limited to dogs). It is straightforward and slowly enough paced that no one should be afraid it will be too difficult for them, and the instructor is enthusiastic and eloquent. I have a PhD in a related field and I learned quite a bit, so I would recommend this course to others.",4
29449,"I enjoyed this course and found it very informative. I would like to see more practical information related to dog training in the material, but I understand that is not the purpose of this course.",4
29459,It would be better to provide detailed explanation for the cases and questions raised in the slides.,4
29461,"A very interesting and useful course. I had some difficulty distinguishing some of the biases - it is like some of them are nested within others, which makes choosing the one that is most relevant to a situation quite tricky.",4
29464,"Best course,very good study material.",4
29467,The course was good and the material was interesting. I wish that the course were more video-based however. There are some videos but they are meant to be played at specific points during the reading.,4
29474,Interesting course about behavioral biais with many examples and cases. Altough I expected a course more oriented into financial decisions on how to learn to avoid financial bias and make better decisions I still learned a lot.,4
29476,Interesting course. I just wished there was more interaction and discussion and that there is further clarification regarding the length of the course.Right at the start Ms. Rasiel mentioned a 14-week course. I feel there's more to the course but I wasn't able to take advantage of it. There were also some videos that seem to start mid-way already.,4
29481,"This course has very interesting and complete content. However, for begginers it can be a bit hard to take all quizes successfully at first attempt, due to the high number of concepts addressed in the videos and articles. Some concepts seems obvious at first, but a begginner can get confused among them. Maybe the material should be better organized in topics, in order to facilitate the comprehension of different ideas. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course.",4
29486,Very useful especially as an introduction to Behavioral Finance. Week 2 would have been better to be split over two weeks.,4
29487,"Comprehensive course on behavioural economics with a focus on getting those constraints in thinking and alternatives for rational thought explained in clear language. Although some prior knowledge in economics comes in handy, this course is clear enough to follow and complete for those with no experience in the dismal science. The video's are clear, the reading consists of college slides and the examples give a clear reading of complex processes.",4
29497,"3 weeks was a bit of a rush to get everything done, but the course was very informative and met expectations.",4
29500,"This is a great starter course/primer for behavioral finance! I would like to thank Dr Rasiel for the contents of this course.Recommendations for improvement:-Create a single sheet defining the biases contained in the course for easy reference.-Add more examples and retrospectives that explain the similarities and differences between the biases.Overall, I really enjoyed the course and look forward to additional courses on Behavioral Finance.",4
29505,"It's a great course, clear explanations and simple videos.The missing star was lost on the way that misleading or undefined bias are presented, especially during the different decision phases.I would like to propose to discuss a case of a stock share in a timeline, to see whether this ""panic"" or ""overconfidence"" applies, and also in global macroeconomics (e-g. the PIGS bubble, the debt bubble)",4
29509,"A different and interesting perspective to look in the field of finance. Content is little confusing and more of self study component, but overall it's worth.",4
29526,You could include a flyback transformer design example in optional lesson.,4
29530,Good Course,4
29533,"The quality of the lectures is very good but the material of the course has some little deficiencies, at least compared to the previous courses of the specialization:-Some slides are not completed. Dr. Khurram Afridi completes these slides in the lecture, but there are not the slides with the final result. I had to take screen captures to save this final result.-Subtitles impede to watch correctly the video when explaining in the subtitles area. I had to switch off the subtitles to be able to watch the video correctly.-I missed the pdfs of the homework assignments. I like to work on them off line, so I had to enter into the assignments to be able to see them.-I also missed the questions alternated during the videos as in previous courses.For these reasons I only give 4 stars instead of 5.",4
29554,the op-amp part was very good. better than others. I do thank the teachers.,4
29555,It is very good learning source to present generation.,4
29556,"Good introduction level course. There are space for improvement though: Content-wise, I wish the instructor can give an introduction or summary on different types of transistors, at least compare MOSFET and BJT transistors; Other aspects: the instructor and mentors could answer questions more promptly. There are questions left unanswered for more than two weeks and questions which never got answered on the discussion forum.",4
29565,"Starting from the Scratch of Diode Information to ending up with Transistor analysis indeed is a great way to either kick off or brush up the concepts in the field of Electronics. This course led me to design fundamentals in Analog Circuits along with good portion of focus on CMOS Design that can be helpful for Digital Design as well. Over and All, It is such a nice course that I will strongly recommend it to my peers.",4
29567,"It was usefull to recal my knowledge of electronics. The course is not deep, but it's that you want from ""introducting"" course.",4
29572,The only complain is that it kind of feel uncompleted,4
29575,very good course a lot of,4
29577,Good for new learner.,4
29578,I wish we could have feedback from coursera organizer as well for further improvement.,4
29584,It is great course for beginners who wish to learn how to write the essay. This course will build your foundation and their idea of peer review and topic practice will help you to make this foundation solid. I have greatly effected with this course and now i am able to write a 5 paragraph essay in a well manner.Thanks,4
29585,"If you are looking to just take a class here or there, yes you can, but if you want the 5th course open to you you must complete the 4 courses before. Had I known this I would have started that way, instead I took 3 and tried to take 5, it does not work that way. If you are looking at cost, be sure to review the those options. While I didn't think I needed the other courses, I found it helpful to refresh my memory and it also helped understand the direction of the course material and assignments in detail. Even though it may look simple, always take notes during the lecture videos because by the time you get to the quizzes you might find your self stumped and the notes are great reminders on the outline principles of the subject. No, taking notes will not give you the answer, its not designed that way.",4
29588,very helpful for academic writing！,4
29589,"Course material was good. But, I was hoping the essay corrections and feedback will be given by experienced teachers/instructors, was disappointed at this as it was given by the fellow students!",4
29597,"I like this course a lot, Professor Tamy Chapman is very good, she explains everything in a way that makes it feel easy to understand. But I would like that the teacher was the one to review our homework submissions.",4
29602,"A very good course for those who want to learn English composition or essay writing, or both. If you are looking for developing your writing skill, you must give it a try.",4
29603,"Great course, I learnt a lot of writing and improve my skills.",4
29607,Good course definitely recommended,4
29608,"Very Good. But still, I think we need the feedback of the professor.",4
29611,"All I wanted was to understand what a basic thesis question was, and what was considered an acceptable, basic, entry-level academic essay. I think this course delivered well enough. I only audited it, and I have thought since that I should have paid the money so I could have gotten more feedback on the assignments.",4
29620,Very good for beginners in essay writing.Thank you.,4
29623,"The course wonderful and just suffer from some shortcomings. First, it assess by the peers, sometime people just say ""great"", ""wonderful"". It surely don't help students who come here to improve themselves. Next, sometimes it is take too much time for assessments. There is no forum or somewhere that you can discuss about the course. There in one to ask about your ambiguity.",4
29641,Good course. Too bad we can t access to everything for free.,4
29646,Nice introduction to essay writing. It gives several tips and examples.,4
29651,"Very good!!! After the course, I feel more confident to writing an essay.",4
29656,"Nice course! But in my opinion, it needs to give more practice exercises for each sub topic so that student doesnt think the course as fast paced.",4
29658,This course really helps improvise and develop essay writing skills.,4
29665,"It was a fun course, and throughout the course I learnt the fundamental basics of essay writing. Only thing that could be improved on is to put some example essays for students to read as an assignment, and go through it afterwards. Also to talk a little faster.",4
29669,Easy to understand for the beginner.,4
29670,"It's a good course for anyone who wants to start writing as it shows you the variety of methods. I personally gained a lot from the lectures. Likewise, the additional links and the assignments were very useful. Thank you!",4
29671,"I learnt a lot in this course that surprised me. I went from being terrified of essays to managing to write one a few pages long. Thank you. My biggest issue and why I didn't give it 5 stars if the grading is via peer review and this meant a long wait and lots of begging PLUS getting only one word reviews such as great. Not very helpful. I would like a person who is experienced in essay writing to do a review, but I do understand that, by sheer numbers of students, this would be non viable.",4
29675,I believe that this course make me more comfortable writing. I like the lessons and the teacher is very clear in explication.,4
29676,"It is a good course in overall, it gave me an opportunity to practice writing and refresh some useful informations about how to write an argument. Minuses of the course: there is no indication of how long it might take for assignments to be graded, some of the students rush through their assignments so it is waste of time to review them instead of an opportunity to learn from others as it should be. Perhaps the non-granded assignments could be more though through to help the learning process?",4
29680,"This course was a little confusing, specially because this was my first experience writing Essays.On the other hand, the feed back was super slow. I still don't know how did I do with all of my assignments.",4
29681,"Getting Started with Essay Writing helps me improve my writing, and changes my point of view toward essays.But we need a feedback on the assignment essays from the instructor or any specialist, the peers review is not enough.Thank you!",4
29688,"it is very helpful, and if could have more details about sample essays, would be better.",4
29690,It's a good course and it has a great structure !,4
29692,This is a great course to advance your English writing skills.,4
29694,"I think the course is very good, but the peer review grading should be improved! Sometime, people have to wait for more than 3 weeks to get their assignment graded, or they don't know whether they will get the grade. Thanks!",4
29702,For those who find it hard to write good Essays. This course is made for you.Great and very informal.,4
29709,"It is a very good course. However, I must admit that is discouranging making the course because when you do the course free you do not have the opportunity to make all the excercises. Despite that, it is very good.",4
29715,I liked it. The content is clear.,4
29717,IMPROVE YOUR WRITING SKILLS HERE,4
29721,"Very good lecture videos,sample essays and quiz. I enjoyed taking this course. It helped me a lot how write the essay. I would like to thank",4
29736,Simple and effective. Great course!,4
29738,"The course itself is exceptional. Instructor elaborates everything perfectly, but it takes really longer time to receive peer-reviews to pass the course. Also course doesn't have any forums where students can post that they need peer-reviews (which can be helpful to finish the course in timely manner).",4
29748,This is a helpful course,4
29749,The instructor way of guiding is highly commendable as a result the concepts can be easily comprehended.,4
29752,"I enjoyed this course; although, I only participated in the free version.",4
29755,"Easy to understand introduction to essay writing. In future versions of the course, would be advisable if people were trained in how to give constructive feedback and there were measures implemented to ensure that people provided feedback. Sometimes I received gibberish as feedback such as ""erg"" or ""uyt.""Training in feedback could include a sample list of common types of errors that people make or ways to give positive feedback that is specific.",4
29757,good. must be followed.,4
29763,I've learn to write the proper essay,4
29765,Thank you for this course I have learned a lot!,4
29789,"It is super nice, but still needs more challenging concepts, sometimes I found it was mostly information I knew while it could be something I never paid attention to regarding the subject.",4
29810,"Leaning from thesis sentence, supporting ideas and topic .",4
29813,The course is very well organised.Ideas are clear and precise.Not too much talk to say a little.,4
29818,I feels interesting when learn in this course.,4
29822,"As far as I know, this course is unique: it is the only one that lets you build your knowledge of modeling climate change by building your own models. I'm giving it 4, not 5, as the forums are very quiet. Prof. Archer has done a great job of providing infrastructure so students can focus on the physics. Assessment is a combination of a grader, to check your code in particular cases, peer review, and quizzes that will be easy if you code works. You can probably bluff your way through the quizzes, but it's easier to get your code working and then read off the answers to the questions. Peer reviews also give you a chance to see how other students have solved the problems.",4
29823,"This contains some very interesting and challenging exercises related to ""Global Warming I"", which are fun to work on. It contains no real instructions about python, and I think it would be better to at least have some guidance there. However, the course info is at least totally up-front with that information.Although this course is related to ""Global Warming II"", it is not correlated with it. It would be a mistake to take them concurrently, since GW-II moves much faster, and is a much shorter course. This was not clear to me when I signed up, and it should be made clear to students at the beginning.I like Prof. Archer a lot, he seems like a good teacher. However, aside from brief introductory lectures (and the selection of great topics for simulation) he plays a rather small role in the course. The student is pretty much on his own. There is no TA or anyone monitoring Discussion questions. There are some places where the ""Model Description"" notes are incorrect and badly misleading (notably in Week 4). I pointed this out, with others, in the ""Discussion Forum"", but we got no response and there was no correction. There are other places where information is unclear, but there is no one to turn to for clarification.",4
29840,FANTASTIC AND ILLUMINATING COURSE,4
29850,I gained a lot of - especially technical - knowledge regarding ebola and I also enjoyed the field experiences communicated by the participating doctors.,4
29870,It was an amazing course but the language was very difficult,4
29880,"Was a great evaluation of what we know sofar and detailed look at the suggested medical practices, whilst provoking a deeper discussion of the bigger picture elements (such as global impacts) simultaneously.",4
29883,Lots of content and interesting interviews though there may have been a superfluity of them. Oftentimes I found myself not paying attention because I was waiting for important information to be delivered.,4
29885,"Nice course!Very elaborate and well detailed.Except for some videos that get stuck for some time making the lesson longer,it was a nice course.I also thank you for giving me this opportunity to get a certificate from Amory University which will help me as an EMT-I.Thank You.",4

29891,"Some excellent material here relating to ethics and Ebola, more focus on the nature of the outbreak and not just the disease. Well worth taking this course. The videos are sometimes rather long and could be more concise.",4
29892,"Very good, broad introduction to many of the issues surrounding this epidemic. My only criticism (and why I only gave it 4 stars) was the unbridled self-congratulatory tone and Emory-centeredness of the course. I realize this is probably a function of why Universities create these free courses. There is a marketing aspect to it. But it did get a little tedious.",4
29896,I really appreciate that the instructors have strong journalistic backgrounds—truly helpful for impactful writing!,4
29898,Great advice o writing best practices. Done with humor and memorable quotes.,4
29899,Very well explained and easy to follow.Learnt a lot from this course,4
29901,"I learned that content strategy is a marketing plan with content, not just the content alone. It is a great course.",4
29906,"Content was fantastic, however delivery was quite dull, two talking heads and chapters from a helpful, but rather dry book. The best part was the assignment. Could be spruced up with some printable versions of the text screens, or even better, a workbook to use in figuring out how to use this at home.",4
29909,Its nice course to begin with Content..,4
29921,Great course!,4
29926,"Hello,This course is very interesting and content are very usefull.As improvement points I would like to mention:1-Some videos are not anymore available2- A general update is necessary to take into account the last years big chances and evolutions on the energy politics and economics dur to the stabilization of oil price notably and all its impacts.",4
29927,"An excellent overview about the complex issues of international energy, its economic and geopolitical implications. I highly recommend it.",4
29931,best course for beginneer,4
29942,Overall a good introduction to the current state of global energy supply and demand. It covers basic information about the controversy of nuclear vs renewables though personally I would have liked a little more detail on this point,4
29945,Very good for general understanding. Information is a little bit old.,4
29952,A very informative and concise course that gave a very basic idea on what is going on in the Energy industry today.,4
29958,Very good introduction to global energy situation.,4
29971,"Great course, but can be somewhat dry at times. Yet, highly recommended!",4
29985,It is not actualized to the current conditions.,4
29993,"English Composition I is an extremely detailed, comprehensive, easy-to-follow and well-thought-out course to help aspiring writers as well as academicians. Dr. Denise Comer, the course instructor, has a very engaging style. She is also very encouraging and makes everything sound very easy, which makes one confident that he/she can do well. Other experts have also shared their insight through videos which are very helpful. Readings and various websites provide guidance and assistance throughout the learning process. The grading system is also thorough. I suggest that if possible, lowest scoring students should be given some kind of a personalized feedback in order to encourage them to do better or address their weak areas. I will definitely recommend this course to other people.",4
30003,the lecturer's voice is too low,4
30018,"The course content is excellent, but the peer review quality can be improved. Course Mentors are kind and helpful, however, the system is not functioning well sometimes.",4
30022,Cool,4
30023,Areas of improvements:common mistakes made and how to overcome themsentence structure and vocabularylearning from prose to better refine writing style,4
30029,"Good introductory course! It gives an overview of the global financial market-as the course name suggests. The math problems are a bit hard though. Improvement can be made for the pop up quiz during the lecture--it suddenly cut the lecture; thus disrupting my concentration. It think it needs to be properly placed during the lecture so as to help in reviewing the lesson, not disrupt the student's focus.",4
30036,"Overall, the course is fine, however there were several annoying typos / rounding issues, which would prevent you from getting the correct answer.",4
30047,A great course for dummies like me to learn the basics of investment industry.I would appreciate if they incorporate more examples to explain and make things easier.,4
30048,The course was very informative. Could have been better if more reading materials along with more real life scenarios were included,4
30049,Good course to have an overview on the global financial markets and instruments.,4
30050,"I like that the course material is divided up such that someone who is busy with a day job can also find time to listen to the lectures and do the quizzes. Also like that the course gets you familiar with the way the financial market is organized and helps one get familiar with the terms. However, I personally felt there was insufficient coverage on the math and many of the quiz questions were not at all easy to understand the terms and apply the formulas. There need to be more examples of such problems so that there is more familiarity with the math especially for those completely new to this field.",4
30054,Great starting point for grammar and punctuation. The teachers point out essential information to understand the rules.,4
30056,Good to review some key concepts of the English Grammar.,4

30091,A great way to revise grammar an punctuation from scratch!,4
30096,"This course provides a very good introduction on punctuation and parallel sentences. Also, it introduces how to write good essay. My suggestion would be that the course could reduce sometime in the week1 learning and add more content in the sentences writing. Thank you.",4
30101,It would be improved if students can have some reviews from the teacher,4
30103,It would be grate if they can offer a course about explanation of more English grammar and Tenses (especially Perfect Tense),4
30106,very helpful!,4
30110,"This is really good. I expected a tedious review of my grammar subjects from grade school and high school. I am pleasantly relieved that the emphasis is on the areas that will be commonly used in academic writing; that is, sentence constructions.

30267,"Paced perfectly for me. A great review as my knowledge of what underlies our language system is well hidden after years of use.

30367,Some very useful points. Would recommend to anyone who struggles in understanding punctuation.,4
30380,"The course is quite informative and useful. However, I think the charge of 60e is too high since the skills introduced are both elementary and limited. 10e would be a proper price.",4
30386,"I would like to thank the course Instructors, It is really fruitful and enjoyable.",4
30387,This was a very good class and helpful. I only had some issues with not being able to see some things on my app like the practice exercises.,4
30394,A really helpful and detailed course. You really can go trough it for four hours and gain quite useful knowledge about the punctuation and the correct way of structuring your essay.

30453,"Very useful and straightforward course on the basics of grammar (but just the basics of Verb Tenses; was expecting more of it in terms of grammar topics - Passive voice, Conditionals, Reported speech etc.)It's basically a Punctuation 101 course which focuses heavily on proper sentence structure and syntax - got a great deal a good stuff out of it, though. Warmly recommend it to everyone who is not confident in his basic writing skills.",4

The lessons are simple; the examples were good for understanding and to the point. The course-content, video and audio qualities are good. Links to extra materials are also provided towards the end of each week.I felt the assignments were too simple. They were reviewed by other students and not by the course organisers. Though peer-review is a good practice, comments from the teachers would be much appreciated. I would prefer more options for discussion on a topic, other than through the assignments alone.",4

30633,"This course is really helpful especially for people wanting to write English articles better. The course outline is well laid out, videos are easy to understand, and exercises are very helpful for practicing your punctuation. The only negative point for me is how the teachers use a very strong American accent that some of the letters in a word are not pronounced anymore, like 'meanin' instead of 'meaning' and 'writin' instead of 'writing'. It doesn't really affect the teaching, though. All in all, this course helped me a lot and I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their punctuation and review their English grammar knowledge.",4

30923,"A concise review of punctuation and (some) grammar associated with punctuation rules in the grammar. A perfect choice for anyone wanting to review punctuation rules swiftly. However, those who would like to review grammar of the English language might not get all what they wanted from this course, which covers only what is relevant to punctuation.",4

31018,I enjoyed this class!,4
31024,"Good for the basics. Good lesson format. Although, the group component was unnecessary.",4
31025,"Of the English grammar courses I've enrolled to, this is the easiest to understand, not to mention enjoyable.Don't hesitate to enroll!",4
31026,More excercises could serve for more practice,4
31036,Excellent course to brush up your grammar and punctuation.,4

31059,This is going great so far!,4
31066,"This course is simple and easy to follow. The lesson that had a great impact on me was about commas. When I learned about it's proper usage, I realized how long I'd been using commas in the wrong way! Thank you UC Irvine for this course! ;)",4
31067,It's a really good course when you are trying to understand more of the grammar and improve your writing,4
31070,I wish it was more in-depth at times with some grammar that is slightly relevant with the course.,4
31073,Excellent course! You can make it even better with concise handouts for every lesson which highlights all the main points for personal future use.,4
31080,I enjoyed this lecture. Thanks!,4
31087,Please add a forum so that people can share their thoughts; this kind of course requires lots of general discussion!,4
31089,On week 4 and I have learned quite a few things already!,4
31092,It was a great refresher course. It was quick and to the point.Thanks a lot.,4
31108,This course has a very good structure and has many useful practice options.,4
31112,It's ok.,4
31119,"Good content, but without a creative didatic.",4
31124,It explains various grammar rules in a very clear and concise manner. Eager to learn more of English grammar.,4
31125,Comes in very handy when you want to improve you English fast.,4

31143,"The course makes you learn:a) when you have to use Simple Past or Present Perfect;b) punctuationc) how to write in clear way.There are problems with IT platform: video often stops suddenly and sometimes it is difficult to understand where you are arrived in the course. Besides, sometimes you don't immediately understand what you have to do for passing to next step of the course.To sum up, the teacher is good. IT staff could do better.",4
31153,"The course focuses on some of the most important aspects of English grammar which are used frequently. Also, these are the topics where students tend to make mistakes. However, few additional topics could have been added to the course",4
31157,Thanks a lot.It was helpful,4
31165,"Very good, simple, understandable course, for everyone who want to improve his English.",4
31173,Graded assignments only for the ones that purchase the course are unfair. Coursera should always allow people to do everything even if they don't purchase. Purchase should only be required for certificates.,4
31175,An excellent course by a fine teacher. The fifth star is dropped because graded quizzes are not available unless the certificate is purchased - unlike most Coursera courses in which I am interested.,4
31182,It improved my knowledge on economic policy making aspects and help me in ready statistics better.,4
31185,good form of assignments,4
31187,The Course is simple yet informative. Sometimes we ignore very simple yet strong concepts. This course is very good for beginners. Also useful for those who wish to brush up their concepts.,4

31206,"Really i like this course, because you can learn more with the software created for this seminary! but i would like that this course would have a second part, that would be awesome!",4
31214,"Excellent explanations, and very creative assignments such as the policy simulator and the peer-reviewed assignments.",4
31219,"Best course yet, a simple to understand teaching approach to a complex concept.",4
31224,"Good course, well structured. Just needs some technical improvements in order to be able to review wrong / right answers in quizzes.Nice to have a second more advanced course in this topic.Joaquín",4
31225,Please reconsider the peer reviewed assignment as it is not very transparent and inefficient.,4
31251,"it is a great course especially for those who like to work upon different models and practise their on results. Gayle has been outstanding throughout with her complete, clear and crisp explanations and diagrammatic representations. It provides a great insight into real life applications and reasonings. Great effort ! Kudos !",4
31264,Subject is Great .. but no Verified Certificates,4
31270,Very interesting and fun to learn!,4
31290,"I Love this course, and I need more reviewing from you",4
31351,Course was good but I thought more could of been added to the content to make more understandable. For ex. videos,4
31357,Good Course. Would have been nice to have some more interactive bits.,4
31372,"I really enjoyed the class. The videos were interesting, entertaining, and educational.",4
31374,"In the first week the course gave a bonus video called Teacher Talk. This could be gave for each week, a great lecture based on theories and techniques taught during the course, recorded from real world classes.",4
31386,"It was a great experience!!! I recommend it, i learned a lot",4
31387,A thoroughly enjoyable and useful course.,4
31406,A little too basic in my point of view.,4
31413,"The discussions in the last three week were shallow. However, I liked the first three weeks. I really appreciate your work. Thanks",4
31418,Very interesting and useful course.Thanks a lot !,4
31423,"thanks for every thing , the most thing i loved in this course is to not being an actor , and i hope you to find a more better way to activate students and teacher communication",4
31426,It was a very useful course. The ideas were simplified by giving simple examples which are not easily forgotten!,4
31441,Easy to follow and understand,4
31452,"Great teachers, fantastic techniques and information. My only complain is that the certificate doesn't comes with the number of hours.",4
31453,"I like watching these training videos, I leaned a lot from it",4
31467,"well organized, user friendly, brief but informative, based on videos (nevertheless, a transcription is always provided), if you are fond of metaphors you will definitely enjoy it. you have a choice to prepare a video clip (if you prefer the spoken language) or an essay (if you prefer the written language) for each assignment",4
31495,"I have just finished the first course of this specialization. I don't expect it all to be as easy as this was for me. I'd say the coolest thing, the way I see it is that, throughout the whole course, they never talked about grammar or rules, rather about how we learn best; how students are affected by teachers; pitfalls of teacher burnout, how to's a few, and how not to, yes, but they mostly stayed toward the positive. Sure, there were some things which might be a little exclusively for language teaching, but I'd say, more, really, the things they explained were about teaching and learning in general. Anyway, I can get that grammar stuff out of books , on the net, or even on the Youtube. It's what makes me a good or a better or a worse or a useless teacher I want to learn. And up until NOW, it's exactly THAT they've been helping me with. One real waker-upper was when they suggested that neither the world, nor the classroom is ever (and never going to be) perfect. THAT was a load off my mind, and one of the most encouraging teacher helps I've EVER had: like, ""Don't look at what you don't have, but what you DO have is what makes you a ""professional""! (even if the lights go out!) Many Thanks! ---Rey Hudson",4
31521,Very useful!,4
31524,Energetic teacher and well organized schedule,4
31541,"I found this course very good for new teachers, but a little repetitive for experience teachers. Still, a great course implemented with knowledge and enthusiasm.",4
31551,Really fun and easy. The course was cleverly presented and I appreciated the emphasis on some of the notables in the field. It wasn't very challenging or it would have been five stars. Nice.,4
31557,"easy for new learners, but practical and meaningful!",4
31571,"Thanks so much, I really got a great benefit that will help me while teaching :)",4
31617,hi its ayesha all i can say is every teacher should regardless of subject and field as language is a meager part of any learning experience,4
31635,The only thing is I would have liked to have the chance to give more detailed peer reviews.,4
31638,I liked this course very much,4
31641,Very helpful contents with videos of the length long enough to learn and short enough to keep learning interesting.,4
31653,"A nice introductory course. For people that already have some Teaching or Language Acquisition under their belt, there may be some feeling of review. However, there is also valuable information and fresh angles on how to look at some aspects of language learning and teaching.",4
31665,The same reason with course 2 . This course is perfect . I would recommend this one to my friends if any one needs it . But not friend around me,4
31674,"Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses. The peer assessments are potentially interesting but, in practice, the majority are so trivial--3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures--as to be hardly worth reading. Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading, the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted.The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others. . . not. I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I'm a boring old sod!",4
31675,"The previous Coursera forum format was far more useful than the current, new, format used in this course.",4
31681,"I know that it would be near impossible to do this on a website like Coursera where thousands of people are probably enrolled in your course, but it would be great if there was some real evaluation (teachers or experienced alums to comment on the quality) of our essays/responses.",4
31692,"I think it's a really good opportunity to be able to obtain a TESOL certificate online and this course seems to be able to do it very efficiently. However, I have found the approach of the style of the lessons a little bit slow and too dramatic- and somewhat even childish. I'm sure the planning of this certificate program is to ensure that people who take it will remember it so that they can really make use of it in their profession- so they probably avoided long and boring lectures. But still, I must admit that the lessons look a little bit annoying sometimes :) Still, thank you for the opportunity.",4
31757,"Most of videos are great but I think instructors can provide more details for each one, because most of ideas are general and normal.",4
31790,"I learned some great techniques in this course, one in particular is to the 80/20 rule. Language teachers should allow learners to talk more, and teachers talk less! My only drawback is that I could not see my own responses to Essential Questions or feedback from my peers.",4
31795,"Great! If this was the first I'm excited to start the others. The content is very instructive, a lot of concepts and useful tools. They should add more content per week, because is too little material to study per week. Thus, sometimes it seens to be boring. But it's ok.",4
31810,"I liked a lot, thank you very much for share your knowledge with us.",4
31819,"I really enjoyed this course. The videos are really informative, yet entertaining.",4
31832,"I liked the course and I found it useful . I will recommend it to my friends. However , some of the instructions are not clear. I understood that I have time to catch up till Dec 21st. But now, My assignment and editing are not accepted and I want to know what I can do.",4
31839,Good basic course for anyone interested in starting to study language teaching,4
31846,"This course is really good for the ones, who, like me, want to learn more about teaching English for basic learners.",4
31848,"On overall its a very good course, but assignment submission was a bit confusing !",4
31854,"The course is good enough--a means to an end. The 4-part, six weeks apart format is kind of bothersome because the wait period sort of dampens the momentum and enthusiasm created during the first course (especially if you complete the whole thing in a week-end). The course is well put together and infused with a little humor. The visuals are good and if you're in the right mood, the course is enjoyable and ifun to interact with folks from around the world.",4
31858,"The course is very inspiring and educational. I do appreciate that coursera and ASU can put this course on site. It synthesizes education theories and actual teaching experiences. However, I do think this course would improve a lot if teaching practices could be incorporated because for teaching professionals the teaching itself is the most important thing.",4
31866,Almost lost me on the first week but so glad I stayed because this course contains some real gems.,4
31874,First of all i would like to thank everyone who was involved in making of the program. İ think the program has been creativlely well presented. İ am already looking forward to Global Health : An interdisciplinary part two :). Thanks,4
31879,Very interesting course!,4
31887,I simply love it. Learning a lot.Thank you,4
31897,the instructor is very motivating in the way she presents the material. She really made me enjoy the course!,4
31900,"Quick, direct and with some mind opening ideas!",4
31901,Interesting course. Good quick way to gain a better understanding of the conflict between Israel and Palestine.,4
31905,It starts off a little slow and videos are very quiet but then it becomes really interesting and the short videos and change of presenters make it very easy to follow.,4
31906,"Amazing course, this really amplifies the roots and causes of the origin of the creation of the state of Israel. A little bit too much information that I belief can be sintetized, but overall still great to give the student a really solid overview on the context of the British Mandate of Palestine.",4
31908,a bit tedious but lots of information,4
31909,"An excellent course - as an introduction, it covers the material in a logical way, and presents critical views on actions of parties on all sides. Has whetted my appetite to know more about the history of creation of Israel and to explore particular avenues that couldn't be covered in detail due to introductory nature of course.",4
31917,"The course was extremely informative and managed to explain complex circumstances very simple.I highly recommend this course therefore. I was able to learn new things about the history of Israel which were never brought to me like that by history teachers. Great opportunity to broaden knowledge.Suggestions:Although the course was very good structured sometimes sophisticated history terms in the context of Israel and Palestine occurred in a video and were explained properly one video later. But because they were explained shortly after and it happened only like three times I would suggest to have a little box with terms like Lechi or Palmach, White Paper from thetime they occur first right beneath every video.The interviews with the experts of each fields had sometimes an odd audio recording and one person therefore spoke louder then the other and I had to turn my speakers on full volume sometimes. If the course gets rerecorded one day I suggest to look into those samples in particular.Thanks for this great course.",4
31931,Great way to learn. Tests are to hard,4
31935,There is a problem with subtitles.Sometimes they are different from speech.,4
31937,good for people who wanna know the brief. would be better with more details and sorties,4
31943,Excellent course. I enjoyed learning about Israel and will help with understanding world events.,4
31944,Very good class though at times it could be hard to hear some of the audio lessons,4
31950,"A good synopsis of the history of Israel. I enjoyed learning about this subject, and especially enjoyed the interviews and conversations.",4
31953,The teaching for this class is 1st rate. Much information and nuances given,4
31956,"This is a great introduction to Israel and Middle Eastern politics. It's not too tough- everything is broken down into very manageable 7 or 8 minute lessons, so it's easy to acquire a general understanding of the factors that led to the formation of Israel. Students looking for an in-depth examination may be disappointed, but if you're curious about this fascinating and very relevant chapter of history, this course will give you a good overview, and leave you hungry to learn more.",4
31957,I found this course to be very interesting. I took this course simultaneously with the one from UCSD on the Holocaust so they enhanced each other. I especially appreciated having a lecture in which Anita Shapira participated - I had already read 'Israel: A History' so it added an extra dimension to that. A couple of small niggles - a) I think a warning for those that don't speak Hebrew that they need to use the subtitles facility(something I've never used before) b) I think some of the English spellings may be ambiguous when translating from Hebrew because of the special use of vowels.All in all I enjoyed this and hope you provide more courses relating to the Israeli/Palestinian situation. Many ordinary people are very uninformed and vulnerable to misleading propaganda. Courses like this are vital in informing non-Jews.,4
31959,"Interesting course, but rather too short and not going very deep",4
31967,"I enjoyed Part Two, but not nearly as much as Part One. This change is not due to the professor or the course material; both are excellent. It is the music itself. I simply do not enjoy most of disco and pop artists like Madonna, Janet Jackson, Brittney etc. I hope I do not sound snobbish (or sound like my parents), but mentioning the Beatles and former mousketeers in the same sentence or course is laughable.",4
31974,"Similar to Part One, but continues with the history of rock into more recent times (1990s). Very short course compared to the other one. Pros and cons from Part One apply to Part Two.",4
31982,Great course,4
31986,Impressive study....,4
32000,"The lectures were not too advanced to understand and held a very high standard. My only critique is that the language of the lecturers was sometimes difficult to understand, which at times caused me some confusion. I will recommend this course to others and I enjoyed taking it.",4
32013,It was okay....kind of hard to understand the teachers....,4
32018,"This course does a great job in explaining where the Nazi ideologies stemmed from, and what the Jews' journey entailed from when Hitler rose to power to the concentration camps.",4
32024,"If you are wanting to understand the Holocaust, this is an awesome, informative course.",4
32027,"This course was very educational. I thought the illustrations were helpful. My only negative comment was that the quiz questions were a little confusing at times and difficult to know what answer to choose. At times, multiple answers seemed correct based on the material presented in the lessons. I do plan to take Part 2.",4
32029,"The course is very nice, I love it. But the teacher speaks without intonation. But the course is super great!",4
32031,"Very good content, but technical issues (poor closed captioning, ambiguous question on the exams, a couple of readings that were a little esoteric for an introductory course) led me to mark the course down a star.",4
32032,Very interesting!,4
32033,"It is a nice course, very well organized for those you are eager to learn about the theoritical aspects of linguistics, such as semantics, morphology. Every video has several quizes, just like every module. I would surely recommend it to anyone.",4
32039,It's fantastic to have a brief look into the intriguing Linguistics. There's so much to learn. But some of the readings and test might be too difficult and improper for a beginner.,4
32047,"Excellent course, though I found it difficult. The exercises that required listening to students speaking different languages were particularly hard for me, probably because I speak only English and my ear is poor. Nevertheless, I persevered and feel I got a great deal from the course. I would like to take the next course in the sequence, if there were one.",4
32048,Great introductory course. Helped me a lot to understand what linguists do even if I didn't quite get all the key ideas which weren't all explained in depth enough. The examples from languages are helpful but require quite a good ear so I guess it takes some gift for languages.,4
32049,"Great course. Even though it says An Introduction... I found it demanding.By the way, when I started the course it was possible to see the number of hours a week needed to complete the course (3 - 4 hours) on the course description. However, now it's not possible and I need this important information a.s.a.p.Thank you!",4
32062,"Interesting content, but still a bit buggy...",4
32067,"I learned very much in this course, and I am thankful for the opportunity to have taken it. I found some of the quiz questions to be unnecessarily difficult because of how specific they were to the videos of the language informants, but overall, I enjoyed the course and the wide range of supplemental materials that are offered.",4
32073,"A nice refresher for people who already have a linguistic background, and a nice introduction for beginners also. My problem was all the weird questions about the informants. Some of the questions are really hard to understand which makes them impossible to answer. I'm glad I took the course though!",4
32080,"Sometimes it was hard to understand the concept the professor was trying to make, because some grammatical forms were wrong and therefore the whole concept misleading. Otherwise very interesting course and thank you!",4
32084,"The course was very interesting and well laid out. The only problems I faced were technical issues during quizzes and forum posts, but the course content itself is excellent and a good starting point for exploring linguistics and human languages.",4
32087,"I liked the couse a lot, but I think the quizzes are very tricky and there are questions that you have to deduce more than to know. This is OK as part of learning, but it turns a little difficult when English is not your first language. Also, there were some errors in the quizzes, especially in week 3 and 4. It's very interesting to listen to the informants, but I find difficult to answer the questions about them. I'm not familiar with those languages and it's very hard, and I think that's not the point of the course, like to know how to say ""grandma"" in Abruzzese or how many ways there are to say ""son"" in Chinese. So, it may be taken into consideration. Anyways, I really liked the course and I hope it can grow for the best. Thank you!",4
32088,101 linguistics,4
32095,"Very nice work on the various fields of Linguistics, high level interviews, but rather laborious and time consuming quizzes.",4
32098,The interview with Chomsky a real treat.,4
32100,"Introductory insight into Linguistics. The professor takes you very briefly about the variety of subdivisions in linguistics , which , each by itself being a big subdivision within linguistics. Enlightened with basics of all these different approaches of investigating languages",4
32101,"I enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I wish there had been more interaction in the discussions, though.",4
32104,"Firstly, I'd like to thank the professor for bringing us such a great class on linguistics! The course gives a general introduction on what linguistics is about in quite a balanced depth, not too deep to scare people away while not too shallow that you may feel boring. The missing star is due to some vague instructions of quizzes.",4
32105,"A great course, it contains very broad discussion of the problems of linguistics.Quite demanding quizes force students to watch videos carefully and to read the required reading. This leads to better understanding of the matter.The videos in the course are great too, the explanation of prof. Oostendorp is very lively and entertaining. The interviews with specialists are unique.",4
32110,"Interesting way of presenting the basics of linguistics. Helps a lot to organise crucial informatinon in one's memory. Lessons, however, are too similar.",4
32113,"The course is a lightweight introduction to Linguistics. If you are absolutely new to linguistics, it will provide you with enough information for further research and self-development. There are some really interesting facts provided by the required reading of the course.What I mostly liked about the course is the list of additional literature. What I mostly didn't like are quizzes - I little bit too reliant on the question formulation. The only quiz that I really liked was about syntactic analysis of informants' sentences.",4
32121,"VERY good content and classes! Some questions in the quizzes are confusing, and there was the trouble with the required reading for Week 3. The first Honors assignment is confusing - specially its very last input question.",4
32126,some problems in quiz part are confusing... but nice course in general,4
32143,Material is excellent and very interesting. Test questions can be confusing and poorly phrased.,4
32146,"Excellent explanation and transition overview of how economics are growing. However, I was not from proper economic background and so Faced some difficulties in understanding special terms used such as crawling peg, anchoring etc. Worth it if you can do handwork and have a spark to learn global perspective of emerging market economies .",4
32151,"This is my 1st course taken. I´m from Panamá (507) so my native language is Español, and this course was very easy to understand. And Professor Doug E. Fresh, knows how to explain the different terms very well. This was my Sunday nights favorite activity, I increase my avatar knowledges. I RECOMMEND THIS COURSE INSTEAD OF THE NETFLIX TIMEWASTING ACTIVITY. Did you know that Netflix is a Disruptive Technology. BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEYOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (I can´t give the 5 stars because there are some video miscordination in Module 5)",4
32153,A good refresher well explained though good examples.,4
32155,It is a well prepared and organized course for basic information and knowledge about the subject.,4
32157,"This is a great way to remind oneself the key concepts of strategic management. However, for a complete newbie some modules might require more detailed explanation.",4
32159,It's a good course although I wished it used more strategic techniques.,4
32163,Tough but useful,4
32166,"Good course when you want to get to know some basic mechanical physics. Examples are real world scenarios which makes everything much more relatable and exciting.Course has very little math in it so it's easier to follow for beginners. But if you want some math exercises and examples then you need to find some other course/book to help you.I think Louis hasn't visited the page for a while, because he hasn't given any comments in discussion forum for a while. There's some activity in the forum by community, but not the author of the course.",4
32167,"I really liked your course. One thing that I think would be great is that if you could add questions on the video about the definition of a term, by opposing it with another term. Example: Weight vs Force, or Net Force vs Frictional force.",4
32193,"this course brings to me a explanatory answers to the ordinary physical works surrounding us, i can say that is a fundamental stuff for beginner who love physics. It's naturally good.",4
32201,Great course! The instructor is funny and engaging.One major disappointment is that the graded assignments are inaccessible unless you pay to earn a verified certificate. I do not like the idea of being forced to provide an ID and set up a webcam. That should be optional for those who want a certificate and not penalize those who are taking it just for the enjoyment of learning. I am only allowed to access the videos.,4
32205,"This course is excellent, mostly because its professor, Louis Bloomfield knows how to both entertain and teach to people who are not at all expert scientists or mathematicians. It's a lively class that keeps you engaged with his irreverent pedagogy. I do wish it would continue, however, so that I could have some lessons to accompany the rest of his text book!",4
32211,Great begining for physics,4
32214,It'so interesting and helpful!!!,4
32226,"This course was very informative and I loved how enthusiastically everything was presented but one thing that put me off was the length of the videos. I understand that you need to cover all the information but when I look at an upcoming video that is 30 minutes long, I don't feel as encouraged to start it. Maybe if you could separate those type of videos into smaller sections of 5-10 minute videos.Another thing that bothered me was when I took a quiz and got something wrong but couldn't figure out why because it doesn't have an explanation and I didn't know which video to watch. Maybe they should give the video name and start time of explanation (e.g. How Would a Ball Fall on the Moon? (5:36)). If they did that, it would be easier to find an explanation to a question.",4
32235,Best physics teacher I ever had!,4
32246,"It is good that the professor was able to connect physical laws to day-to-day events and phenomena and help laymen like myself understand them through simple, less technical explanations.However, it would be better if the questions in the quizzes can be explained after attempts. Though I could retake the tests, sometimes, it is through sheer trial and error that I got some answers correct. In this way, true learning is not achieved.It would be good if the answers to the quizzes could be re-explained with parts of the lesson vides to draw the links. Sometimes, that link is not obvious. It is not immediately clear which part of the lesson pertained to which quiz questions and that made reviewing the lessons after getting answers wrong not helpful.I speak from a perspective of a student who has not taken physics since 14th grade.",4
32250,Accessible to almost anyone! with a functioning intellect.,4
32256,Highly informative in a simple manner,4
32263,Interesting material,4
32268,"The course is very practical, and gives many great every-day tools for understanding how things work. Nevertheless, I feel it lacks mathematical references. For example, I would like to see proofs, examples with actual numbers and etc.",4
32276,"Really cool course, explaining some basic physics ruling everyday life",4
32283,"Interesting topic, with useful case-studies, removed a star because it feels too much like the speakers are reading their text, with frequent errors in the words / corrections / hesitations = doesn't feel natural enough. Most probably due to the danish-english language effort...",4
32299,"Really good course, learned a lot of hybrid development",4
32303,"Some things are not updated. Some things should be reviewed deeper. It is a good course to start developing hybrid apps, but should be updated.",4
32330,Very good course. Most of the new features and technologies were well explained. Maybe a little more hands-on exercise will not be a bad idea.,4
32334,It's hard to setting up development environment correctly,4
32337,Last section with the emulators needed more guidance on how to install. I received few errors just trying to install the platforms emulators in my pc,4
32343,"The course could be explained much more in depths. Certain concepts are explained on the surface and remained not so clear. The teacher is very nice, however, he could explain the material in much easier way",4
32344,Great course,4
32346,Its good,4
32349,Not as good as previous courses from this specialization,4
32354,Not too difficult,4
32357,"Good course, but the development cycle is hard and I had to suffer a lot when it comes to the device emulations . I know the time is short, but I would be happy if you can provide a course or some helpful links. The first two weeks are nice to develop, because of the ionic serve --watch.",4
32365,Realy good,4
32368,Recommended for any learner - I'm in awe of the professor and how he neatly explains everything at a clear pace.,4
32378,"This course serves as a great introduction to mobile web development. Notice that multiplatform in this case means iOS and Android (no Windows Phone) and you do get a bit of hands on work on Android SDK and XCode, although mostly for setting up both environments. Professor Muppala is again outstanding in the class, covering a wide range of topics combined with multiple exercises which in my case really furthered my understanding. One thing I believe could improve would be having either at least one assignment forcing you to deploy to Android and another one to iOS. In my case, it was just too comfortable to simply deploy to an iOS device and barely look at Android. Also, the vibration function should not be part of an assignment, as not everyone will have a device to test it and neither of the emulators really use it. One final recommendation for those pressed with time: I was able to follow Professor Muppala quite easily while playing the lectures at 1.75x (it's funny how slow he seems to speak when I set in back to 1x :-) ).",4
32382,"good course indeed, but should have information about places we can fin help especially parts where we run emulators.",4
32386,I took the initial offering of this courser. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. My only suggestion would be to clarify some of the grading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment. I would definitely recommend this series of courses and I am looking forward to taking the final course in this Full Stack Web Development series.,4
32387,great course,4
32390,"Good course, although felt like it didn't quite cover enough fundamental material concerning Ionic framework and how it sits within the scope of the specialization.",4
32397,A pity that the submission are now blocked for not paying students.,4
32399,Good course.Unfortunately the last week's worth of material wasn't particularly insightful or useful.,4
32406,Great course !,4
32408,"Would have given full, but the assignments are paid..like WTF!!!",4
32413,"Very good, connected also to relatively recent outbreaks. Maybe some miniquiz/few question after each block would be nice to sum it up and help with preparing for quiz after whole week.",4
32414,Really interesting course if you want to be more informed about the dynamics of global disease transmission and emergency responses,4
32419,Very thorough and comprehensive course--all lessons are in easily-understandable English,4
32420,"Interesting course, I am a geo-information specialist and I took this Course to gain some understanding on epidemics so as to be of influence in mapping and modelling their spatial patterns. I have loved every bit of it especially the last part- Zombies!! I needed to hear more.",4
32421,"Pro: All topics seem to be covered, full overview of this field.Con: Please, please, get rid of the childish drawings and get som serious artwork.",4
32429,"Thoroughly enjoyed Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Disease. As a final year student doctor with an interest in infectious disease, I found this course was a very engaging and enlightening way of expanding my knowledge of infectious disease. My perspective of Epidemics and infectious diseases had greatly broadened. Would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Epidemics, infectious disease, healthcare, or microbiology.",4
32436,"Of course, its a nice course but the calculations were little more for me to understand as I am a Medical doctor. I enjoyed the course. Thanks one and all for helping me to understand the course",4
32438,"Great course, will def be looking for more like this.",4
32442,Some of the lectures were a little dull but the information was fantastic!,4
32444,"Really nice introduction course. I am however a bit disappointed it did not went deeper in how the models of diseases spreading are built, and that the course overall does not go into much detail. A bit more technical detail (maths, biology etc.) would make this nice course a awesome course.",4
32446,I felt that this course was more information driven and just getting to know facts and facts and more facts . though this course is designed for anybody to do I feel a student would do better if they had past experience and knowledge about a few common diseases.,4
32460,The test difficulty was a lot easier than the actual course content.,4
32474,"It is a great course, really interesting, really easy to complete though some of the topics are a bit challenging. Overall a great achievement to finish this course. (Although I didn't receive a certificate but at least I finished the course)",4
32478,"Fantastic Course! great content and compelling presenters. It really opens your eyes to infectious diseases and all perspectives it braces, science, social aspects, biology, ecology. I recommend for bio/science folks.",4
32479,very intresting,4
32481,"Nice course. I sometimes wished the lectures had more in depth coverage of the material instead of so many ""big picture"" statements. But overall, the course was a nice overview of diseases. Thank you to the instructors!",4
32486,Really good material. Lectures are fun to watch and easy to follow.,4
32492,Nice course and extremely we'll presented. Cood ideas and the presenters also did a great job.,4
32501,"I liked the course, with its many different speakers and approaches.The one thing I missed the most was seeing the models in action. Even if the course isn't aimed at scientists or programmers, there are free online simulations where one can adjust model constants to see the effects interactively without any knowledge required.See NetLogo at http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/, for which there are forest fire, disease spread in networks, cellular automatas and many other interactive simulations. Insight providing questions may involve finding the value of a parameter such as the epidemic can't spread, for instance.For more formula oriented optional exercises, I would recommend something similar to Differential Equations in Action from Udacity. It's a relatively easy course implementing the SIR model, physics and ABS. An exercise could be ""modify the simulation to consider X% germs get resistant after each antibiotic treatment"" (either in NetLogo, or Python).",4
32507,"Great course, but I think It could be more vivid like its predecessor",4
32511,"Overall, the course was good. Somehow, the concepts were not as clear as the basic game theory course. Definitely more advanced.",4
32512,Great course. Nice retracing of some notions of the course Game Theory like Pareto Oprimality. Nice idea doing some examples on auctions and voting systems. Nice proofs,4
32529,Not challenge enough!,4
32540,Very helpful frameworks delivered in a great way. Could be made better still by more in the way of materials and assignments to engage with. Quizzes are fine but don't allow the thought engagement of case studies one can work through even if ungraded.,4
32551,Helped me a lot in order to pass my next Chinese Test.,4
32554,"Well, course greateI've looked at Landscape of Google Clould ML productsWanted more deep Tensor Flow cases",4
32560,It's a short but good course. Good instructions and delivery. Good introduction to Big Data and ML on GCP. Would have liked more assignments as a formal requirement to complete the course. The codelabs are disconnected from the course. Glad to know other courses in the specialization are under development.,4
32568,"Some latter sections felt as if they were not shot in sequence, thus disrupting the flow. This fact notwithstanding,the program is an overall a good overview of the platform.",4
32571,"It is certainly a good course offering a broad overview of the Google cloud platform. However, it could offer more depth in all the modules covered.",4
32574,Very good course. Got a lot of useful insights. - Quizzes are fine and just right amount. But needs more challenging lab exercises for practice.,4
32575,"Good presentation at a high level. Suitable for people with experience, since it doesn't go into details. I think that people new to the concepts will have to do a lot of reading, or take things at face value.",4
32577,Great course with real projects and examples. and easy to follow. It would be better if you also provide the slides of this course so i could read again. Thanks.,4
32578,It would be very helpful to provide all the presentations and labs as a slide deck for later recatch on the GCP foundation,4
32583,Unusually short one but intensive. Focused on Google products. Has opened my eyes toward GCP offerings and how they can be used within ML area. As outcome you will have GCP account on hand plus bunch of ideas how to use it during 12 month of free trial.,4
32585,"Good introduction to using GCP services for machine learning. Utilizes google code labs for hands on exercises and outlines resources for further learning. Could use some improvement on quiz questions and course flow, 1 week 6 module format is different than many other MooCs.",4
32589,very well organized content and materials. Good presenter as well.,4
32592,"This was a good overview of the services Google Cloud Platform offers. There were a few bugs with the quizzes, but overall it was put together well and had a lot of information for a short course. I think it is a good introductory-level course for a person who has some background in Data Science and cloud computing, but not much experience with Google Cloud Platform. The tutorials and exercises are quick walk-throughs that can be completed in 10-15 minutes each. They give you a feel for how the Google Cloud APIs work and what some of the capabilities are, but don't go into much depth. This is an ideal course for a person who is considering using Google Cloud Platform but isn't sure what the advantages and capabilities are.",4
32597,Very good introductory course!,4
32599,Its a good overview. I am looking into health informatics for a possible masters course. I learnt a lot. I wish there were more practical examples of how informatics improves healthcare delivery,4
32602,A very interesting course. Obviously the faculty are well versed in the field. Would have been much nicer to have informaticists from other areas participating instead of all from the nursing field.More on data visualization would have been great!,4
32603,Very helpful for healthcare informatics professional,4
32604,the lectures were very useful and practical...enjoyed the course,4
32613,An insightful and challenging course. I really enjoyed it.,4
32619,It is a pretty interesting course,4
32620,"I felt this course was well developed. It certainly captured some of the growing areas of informatics throughout healthcare. I would have liked to have seen a broader scale of examples such as how informatics is impacted other avenues of healthcare - such as in clinics, pharmacies, etc. There are several links in this course which are broken, so I was not able to do the additional reading on the sites I was being directed to. Overall, I felt the information discussed was direct and to the point and all of those who presented the material was helpful and knowledgeable.",4
32645,Excellent introduction to the business of games. Opened my eyes to just how much I have to think about when I decide to make a game development team.,4
32649,I find the course material at Coursera all very good. What is lacking is the peer review system. I understand that there is no way they could offer these courses at these prices. It is however the only reservation I have.,4
32652,"The course content is good, although it is very ""USA centered"". It is very good for people with small experience in the professional market, no just the games area, but all areas.Casey is a great teacher, he makes boring stuff be less boring.The only negative point of the course are the assignments. Again, like in the previous course, the assignments are too subjective, too personal, hard to do and evaluate.Unlike last course (Game Design), I really recommend this one, useful stuff.",4
32660,Awesome course! But I think It was a very short course. I wish it had more content.Very expensive course for this amount of content...still I really like it =).,4
32672,Great content and great teacher. But I found the assignments and the quizzes not that great. I reckon the questions and corrections were a bit subjective and time consuming.,4
32675,"I felt this course was much more fair and the assignments were more realistic than in the previous course, it was better structured as well.In general this course was very helpful and instructive.",4
32677,"The Good> A lot of content> Provided a lot of outside reading material> Passionate professor> A lot of good refreshers (about CVs, teamwork, business practices)Suggestions> I hope in the future more time could be spent on monetization theories and practices> More emphasis on mobile games (as much as I dislike them)> Maybe some type of ""case study"" examples about games from conceptualization to publishing",4
32680,"The material was interesting and the professor was engaging to watch. But unlike other Coursera courses, I never did see any replies from a staff member to any of the questions posted on the forums. Other professors on Coursera reply to threads themselves or have a TA reply for them. I understand that one person may not be able to reply to all threads if the forum is active. But at least those asking questions to get clarification about the assignments should be answered. The class forum was not very active during this session and could have been easily watched more closely by one person.",4
32684,It was good and useful to get a better idea about the industry,4
32685,"Course assignments have nothing to do with the lectures. Most of the assignments could have been copy-pasted stuff from the previous course in this specialization. Same as with previous course - review point organization leaves too many space for individual opinions. Assignment with a video clip is something I didn't expect at all. I had to download a bunch of free software to make it, and I didn't make it good enough, because I'm not skilled in using those programs. Of course, it then reflected my average score, because review point system is too much oriented toward personal opinions of others. I felt this course gave me the least out of this specialization, and I also felt this course scratched a lot of things, but didn't quite get into many details that could have been mentioned (maybe even instead of the assignments that were quite dull to me). There is a section of clips that is a bit useless to those outside of USA. Unlike previous course, this one was at least doable inside the expected work hours / week (except for the video assignment which took me a bit more), and that's why I'll give it 1 point higher than previous course.This review might sound a bit harsh, even though it's not the intention. With a bit of polishing, it could become really great, but it really could use some of the improvements I have mentioned above.",4
32688,"Very good course, I learned a considerable amount from it.",4
32690,Great course. Unfortunately it is not so in the deep as hoped.,4
32692,I believe the final assignment should be a Business Plan for a Game Developer Company. It would sum up all that we learned throughout the course!,4
32694,"Very well designed and thought through.A lot of information that you can continue to develop by yourself.It gives you the tools and talks about processes which you need to surround yourself with.The only thing I lacked was a bit more in depth for some of the latter assignments. Having a template would both be distracting, but also give you some examples on what the level needed would to be to be able to pass the assignments.",4
32698,"I liked the course, it was not just about business with games but all the soft aspects related to making games as well as the ones more related with creating the company an so forth.I enjoyed the course very much.",4
32704,"This course is good for someone that's interested in starting up a company - for video game development or really any kind of self-employed, consulting, freelance or even small business company. I've been self-employed for 15+ years and can honestly say I didn't learn anything that I hadn't already known. But my experiences in entrepreneurship and this course both are similar in content, meaning the class is a good resource for those who don't know where to start.",4
32706,Very interesting course in the business aspects of video gaming. Perhaps a little bit basic (for undergrads) but it has an awesome experience,4
32707,Game video pitch is the most interesting assignment. I have got chance to see other students' ideas.,4
32709,"Many of the issues from the previous course have been fixed in this course. Not bad, but there were still issues with the video content not matching up well with the assignments. Especially in that the assignments are never talked about in the videos, especially how to create the papers that are asked of the student.",4
32711,I like those part focusing on business of games.,4
32713,Better than the second one. It should focus more on the specifics of the game industry. It provides much generalist advice that can be gotten in much better depth in other entrepreneurship content on CourseraI missed a section on what are the main players on the gaming industry and a brief discussion of each,4
32722,"Great introduction! Lots of details! However, this is just a door to sustainable development, it is more of a conceptual framework instead of something that is tangible, more and deeper study is needed.",4
32730,"Great content! Invites you to go further on the subjects and shows you a different approach on sustainability ""design"" that the one you are used to see in your company or city's vision.",4
32732,very nicely put together the contours of urbanization its challenges and some glimpses into the solution framework.,4
32736,Really enjoyed the course and would highly suggest to anyone interested in sustainable city design.,4
32738,It's a good course to know the actual Green economy activity in the world and the aplications. You can take advantage to implement so many ideas in your life and in your city. Thanks.,4
32745,Give good introduction into how we go about making a green and sustainable city.Provide some interesting insights.,4
32746,"Very insightful, great lectures, challenging assignments. Highly recommended.",4
32749,"very interesting, with a lot of great examples of what is done around the world.",4
32763,"It was a good informative course, but at times it gave me the impression that it was more concerned in showcase the research done at Lund than exploring of the subject at hand.",4
32764,"Good understanding on energing concepts, experiences from Scandanavian countries and gets me exploring possibilities in our environment/ cities.",4
32768,"I enjoyed very much this course as a interdisciplinary topic with many very concrete examples from cities all around the world - especially from Scandinavia and rich partnerships with NGO and other organisations.I was a bit more time consuming than the previous MOOC I had followed because of the readings in addition to the video, but also what made the course very rich.",4
32772,"Lots of great material. Very much enjoyed the course. One challenge, keeping current with all of the new programs and projects around the world. Thanks!",4
32776,I did enjoy this course.,4
32777,"I thought it was a very informative course with some great speakers and topics. Each weak gave different topics related to sustainable development of cities. The reason I'm only giving it a 4 was the organisation of the course on the Coursera. The deadlines according to Coursera and the intructors differ, causing some confusion. As well as on the discussion board students from each of the past lessons are put together.",4
32781,Great introductory course to understand citites as sources of solutions instead of sources of problems.,4
32786,"It is a good introductory course, but I think it should go deeper each week content. Being slightly more technical. I recommend this course.",4
32796,"Overall good course (the first MOOC I ever took, so inexperienced in grading these courses), but some areas of improvement remain.I would however suggest less redundancy. Too many papers/videos start with an overview of the problems we are facing, but I would think most students are aware of these problems coming into the course, and if not, they need not be repeated so many times. Also, some of the papers seem to use a very redundant and roundabout way of communicating information, with a lot of repetition and sometimes over-contextualization. Shorter sentences/readability do not make for worse science. :-)",4
32797,"Good course, relevant topics, however they could have been elaborated in a more detailed way.",4
32800,"Comprehensive. You get a firm idea about the direction about the upcoming green urban wave. However, could do with more practical specifics rather than just ideas and guidelines.",4
32810,Structured course.,4
32811,"Very good, however the inclusion of conference talks tend to be less interesting than professeur targeted lessons.",4
32823,This couurse Is very Useful For Beginner in Web Desgin I Really Enjoy With Studying it,4
32837,"I really like the way that Colleen presented the materials. A lot of histories and related information. Since I have some experience in coding, I can follow along. But I think the course will be difficult for fresh starters.",4
32845,It was awesome!! I learned a lot with my own pace!!,4
32849,I learned the basics to,4
32850,This course give a simple guide how to start learn HTML. The instructor even teached and spoke rapidly but she teached me with in honest way. She have given many tips and advices about how to start learning HTML. Nice!,4
32857,Quite helpful in getting back in touch with html5.,4
32861,It would be better if there are more interactive practices.,4
32865,had fun with ur studies thank youfor helping,4
32870,I really liked this course however I would rather to have more help in the FTP or Cpanel part and more coding aswell.,4
32872,Course is taught really well.Lots of space to practice before really going to the next concept.Request more solving sessions,4
32876,I love this course :),4
32901,Well presented lectures!,4
32902,"Intended for beginners, I think people who have never programmed or written any web pages before get a good overview.",4
32905,Great course for beginners!,4
32922,Awesome lecture really enjoyed it thank you very much,4
32929,This course helped me a lot to learn about coding based on different browsers etc. HTML5 is required for any front-end based jobs.,4
32934,"good....but marking by autograder is very strict.....i created the exact same page, i run it and it was perfect but i did not get 1 point for that in quiz....",4
32939,This course is ok for the beginner.,4
32947,Properly structured and well explained all the topics.,4
32949,"I liked the course, but I have to mention that i got pretty furious over that last quiz. I had no idea how to get these progress-bars the right way to look. So I spent hours on trying to figure it out, only being left with an unsatisfied answer, which is that i gotta use CSS. I'd have really loved to find out if i can recreate these bars using only HTML. Anyways, The course was great though and explained a variety of things like website-hosting and accessibility. If there was one thing I'd change about the course it would be, more practical use of the mentioned tags. Thanks for the journey.",4
32950,This course is very helpful for a new learner. I have learnt a lot of new things.,4
32955,a fine introductory course for newcomers,4
32956,"Great course, have a importamt information",4
32968,"I love Colleen's style of presenting and teaching. It's refreshing! She looks like she's a great teacher who thoroughly enjoys sharing her knowledge with others. Her students at UMich are very fortunate indeed. As to the course content: it's very well structured, with clear explanations and quizzes/assignments that help understand and apply the course material. Maybe one flaw: it was such a brief introduction, it left me wanting for more. But I guess that's also a good sign, right? So if you have little time and you really want to get the basics to start working on web development, look no further than this course.",4
32974,It's really nice of you all that giving everybody the opportunity to learn this course. Thank you very much and keep up your good work.,4
32977,Learn a lot of new things. Great Course to learn HTML.,4
32978,It is really a great start course for learning HTML. It is neat with practical examples.,4
32981,Good basic HTML5 course. Very clear and practice oriented.,4
32993,Very easy to learn,4
32995,Very good. I have learned a lot.,4
33010,Thank you!,4
33013,Great course with great instructor. Straightforward and direct.,4
33018,She was an exceptional teacher throughout but I believe that some tags weren't explained thoroughly like the navigation tag she just told us about it and so I had to search around on how to use it.,4
33020,It gives the basic of the basic of HTML5. I would recommend to either merge this course with other courses that have more about web stuff or to add some JS stuff to the course,4
33023,I loved it so much.Collen is a good lecturer and all she said i understood.,4
33024,Very good course with an a progressive learning,4
33025,"Overall excellent course. I felt, maybe wrongly, that some of the terminology and information given expected you to grasp immediately and this slowed my progress somewhat as I had to re-watch or go online to 'simplify' what I was being told/asked.Otherwise an excellent course which I would highly recommend for others looking to begin their journey in to HTML5 and CSS3.",4
33027,"Really helpful course. It is indeed the basics of the basics, but it definitely settled up a starting background for those that wish to develop a website. I would definitely recommend to a friend with no experience in the field at all.",4
33038,well-educated teacher. good pace of learning and easy to understand,4
33047,"A very concise introducton to HTML, has helped me imensly with my work.",4
33051,"The instructor is very good. The course could use a litle more practical assignments, but the concepts explained are still very good and useful, even if the course is mostly theoretical.",4
33052,"Great course, clear and straight content.",4
33053,Good introduction,4
33058,Very good teacher. More coding exercises would improve the course.,4
33067,"Very interesting course, but some of the material is for complete novices.",4
33070,Good class. Covers the basics well. Great instructor.,4
33078,for the beginner it is excellent,4
33087,"Nice course, but felt very anemic.",4
33088,"Overall, it is very helpful, though there are some typos in the slides, and more practice would be better.",4
33089,I like the course it was very simple and easy to follow. I only thing I didn't like was the final. When your code was wrong it could at least give you a hint about what needs to be addressed,4
33091,Precise and helpful introduction to HTML5,4
33093,"Thanks to everyone, thanks to Coursera for the opportunity of learn and for supporting me, because I do not have the economic resources and education in my country is not a priority. Thanks.Sincerily . Javier Díaz Sánchez (MX)",4
33095,"I enjoyed the pace of this class however, I was not too keen on the way code is graded, e.g. for the final project of the 3rd week, although my code validated and the resulting page was identical to the instructor's mockup, it was still marked incorrect in the quiz and there was no way to determine exactly what the issue was. There has to be a better way to grade coding assignments.",4
33117,"Great beginning course to avoid being overwhelmed. I had no experience in writing code or how it worked, but I got to the ""final"" and realized how much I actually loved writing code! And, I do it well, which makes me want to work on it more and learn to do more.",4
33121,i have completed this coursera in one day.,4
33125,"Great course for an overview of what HTML5 is like! I would have preferred it, however, if there still was a kind of instant autograder, like a parser or something. The lecturer is quite good as well!",4
33147,I think this course is easy to understand and also covers interessting topics for beginners.,4
33149,its was really nice and beneficial...i got to learn a lot about HTML5 (Y),4
33152,Loved the class. Feel like i definitely got what I needed to in order to learn.,4
33153,"When I started this course, my only experience with HTML was <b> bold</b>, <i> italic</i>, and <u>underline</u>. After this course I have a much clearer understanding of what HTML is, and how it works, and I am able to now use it to a much greater extent than I was before.The professor did an excellent job of explaining most things, but I did find that on occasion I had to stop the video and go back several times to understand what she'd said or to take notes, despite having slowed the video down as much as possible. (In my opinion, one should be able to slow the video down more than is currently possible, especially for those for whom English is not their native tongue.) With me, it wasn't that I didn't understand what she said so much as I didn't have time to take in what she meant before she'd gone on to something else.I understand that Coursera is able to do what it does because of its method, which is basically independent study; one watches the videos, and reads whatever resources are listed, and goes on from there. If there is a question, it is not the professor in the videos that the question is asked of, but people hired as ""teaching aides"". These are the people (other than fellow students) who answer your questions, and they do not always answer in a 'timely' fashion. While this method works well for some people, I am quite sure there are others unable to learn with this method, especially if the subject turns out to be a more complicated, intensive one. Some people need to have a little more than just videos which they can only repeat over and over with the same information, hoping to learn something new from it.The only other thing I have a problem with is the lack of oversight/security. There's no way of knowing if the person who 'earns' a certificate is the person they claim to be, or if they earned the scores given.All in all, I think Coursera is a great tool, and well worth the low prices charged; I am sure there are plenty of courses still remaining (after the 'purge') that I would love to take.",4
33157,The last assigment Is not specific enough for me.,4
33161,"I would have given this course 5 stars if not for the final exam, which is to look at a jpeg and then write code to make a web page look exactly like the jpeg. The issue is that there are many ways to get a page to look like the image and you will still fail the exam. The course creators have realized this and you now have supporting questions that you can pass the course on even if your page code is not validated as correct. In my opinion there are so many better ways this final exam could have been handled, for instance i would have like to have seen a few more questions in the exam, and once passed you could see a forum area open up for us all to paste our code in or link to a page where we could discuss with teachers and moderators etc. personally I believe that sort of approach would add more value.The above being said the content of the course is excellent for beginners with an eye opening focus on accessibility and good content on the DOM structure. The course will provide you with a good set of tools to get a basic page up on the internet.",4
33166,Great start for an initial dive into HTML.,4
33177,this is a very good course need more examples.,4
33178,It was great although I expected a bit more of coding touch,4
33184,Great course..,4
33191,"A great course. You can learn a lot if you're willing to dive in yourself beyond the lectures. My only fault is that some of the quiz questions didn't really seem relevant to useful material learned in the course (ie, what year html was implemented etc.)",4
33195,new things learnt validation & accessibility specially,4
33197,This course is so easy to understand I enjoy it,4
33213,"Presentation style seemed a tad monotonous, but material is well explained",4
33222,I wanted to get an understanding of the fundamentals of html and this was a great course. It doesn't babysit you so you have to get interactive with the coding to actually learn it.,4
33223,"The course was presented at a decent pace. I would like to see more live coding though. Thanks, learning from you was enjoyable.",4
33229,Very happy with this course. Now I have more confidence towards HTML5,4
33230,"Good basics . Do th3e CSS course after it asap :) . they both are a very good combo . Instructor is good , i haven't much used the discussion forums",4
33240,Excellent course! Highly recommended!,4
33243,great course with a great instructor :),4
33245,Could have done with more coding but a well-conducted course to get you interested in HTML.,4
33246,"Really basic course, great for everyone who haven't seen or written any code in their whole life. Teacher is surely likeable and content is easy to follow even during busy, full of work week. It teaches mostly about tags and how to put them together in proper way. I really liked constant reminders about accessibility, that definitely helps with making good habits.",4
33251,A good start if you know absolutely nothing about HTML. If you are perfectly comfortable with basic HTML tags then this is not the course you need. Onward to CSS.,4
33263,I give it a 4 out of 5 . It way what i imagined it to be..,4
33271,"It's a good course for beginner! A lot of knowledges about hosting, domains etc. But not so much about directly HTML5. I would be better to extend this course for 4 weeks!Thank you, Colleen!",4
33280,A great introduction.,4
33281,"It's a good course for beginner, lots of HTML elements are covered in detail during the classes and you will get a good knowledge about HTML. If you code along the course and do all the assignments to practice in the end of the course you will have solid foundation for continued learning and programming in HTML5. It is course that I recommend to enroll.",4
33290,A very good course to begin with.,4
33292,Very well prepared content to get enough knowledge on basic HTML5. It definitely help the beginners to expand their knowledge on HTML5.,4
33299,Great professor wonderful introduction to computer science/coding-1 start due to some confusion with updates to the final exam assignment,4
33301,My very first online course. In a foreign language moreover... I loved it because I really learned a lot of new things. Thank you Colleen!,4
33302,Great introduction to HTML ...very clear!,4
33305,"Nice very beginning start to understand what is HTML, however more coding would have been useful... Thanks Coleen",4
33308,Great.,4
33319,Very good basic introduction. The final project was a little challenging because some of the questions used coding that wasn't reviewed in either the textbook or in the lectures. The lectures were otherwise very informative and well-structured.,4
33323,I loved this Course!,4
33332,"I'd give it a 3.5, but it's not possible so I'm leaning more towards a 4 than a 3.The most positive thing about the course was Prof. van Lent who really knows her stuff. She also has a calm, soothing manner of explaining things and moves with it at the right pace.The content was easy to follow and quizzes were useful. Final assignment was messed up and they really should fix that, but the additional eight questions were basically a transcript of the code itself, and if you did your own code, you shouldn't have had any problem distinguishing the bad code from the good one. Extra stuff for those who successfully finished the course was a nice touch.The real downside of it all was the 'staff'. I got my question answered nine days after I posted it, when I had already finished. I've also seen some rude and condescending yet sparse answers to other students. Similar (but worse) things happen in CSS3 course as well. I don't know who those people are and how they got their jobs, but they should be replaced. Or sent to professional conduct and time management class.",4
33340,This is a good course for an introduction to HTML (some parts of HTML5). This course does not have details about HTML5 !,4
33346,quite easy to learn,4
33353,"very good start point for absolute beginners, so many thanks for discussing Accessibility Issues. considering them is a must for any web page designer and developer.",4
33359,"simple, lucid and organized instruction. great for beginners",4
33363,"Nice course! The take on accessibility is what I found the most interesting one. Whenever I had been through any introductory materials on web design or any designs, I had not even encountered accessibility as a topic. Thank you for getting me into thinking about not only building workable websites, but accessible ones.",4
33375,"Great course for introduction to HTML5, thanks",4
33384,Fast paced and hands on. Totally awesome!,4
33386,Great course! Overall probably a little too basic but definitely a good introduction.,4
33401,Great Class !! Challenging for beginner as we didn't make deadline but got the learning and want to upload our final Exam for credit.,4
33406,"Basic introduction to HTML5. Though there were some issues with final project submission etc. but it was a good start in the world of HTML5. Also, when coupled with the other two courses of CSS3 and Javascript, it would really be a dangerous combination. Looking forward for other courses.",4
33420,Could have been good if there is a practical assignment.,4
33421,i'm glad to joint this course thanks miss colleen.,4
33424,"A good intro to the HTML material, which is an entry level into coding in itself. Since its intro it doesn't cover the vast array of of available tricks accessible within the language and there may be instances where you have to seek tips elsewhere on the internet. By the end of it all you should be able to build some basic HTML elements. With that, there are still some tidbits about the basics of HTML (tags) that I still have questions regarding importance/use of.",4
33430,"Great course! Wonderful teaching by Colleen! However, there is not so much practice within this course, that I expected. Thanks a lot to Colleen for creating this specialization! It's amazing!",4
33431,"Autograder on final project is very frustrating - no feedback on the code to know what it didn't like. Other than that, everything else was very helpful and straightforward for this novice. Thank you!",4
33439,Good starter,4
33446,very informative. I le,4
33455,Pretty nice course with strong focus on accessibility and correct semantics of HTML5 code. Found it useful but a little bit limited in terms of real practice.,4
33463,"A brief but interesting introduction to HTML. Very few practical examples and exercises, but it does cover the basics like: syntax, semantics, what to pay attention to while creating own website. Love the way the material is presented by Mrs. Lent and will finish all three remaining courses.Combined with the HTML & CSS course at CODECADEMY I have the ability to write simple html, read somebody else's code and find resources necessary to get me started with my own page. Till now I always thought HTML and web design was boring, well not anymore!I would recommend this course to somebody who is only starting to learn HTML.",4
33469,"A basic intro to HTML5, well structured and easy to follow.",4
33473,"Nice course.Could focus a little bit more on coding, rather than ask some informational-only question in the quizzes",4
33475,"Good course, but weird final evaluation check.",4
33481,Such a nice course. Very good for an introductory course,4
33482,Ideal for people who starts with HTML,4
33485,"Excellent, clear and to the point. It is good to see a focus on both standards compliance and accessibility, that latter al too often being ignored. Covers a fair amount of ground in three weeks but has fairly narrow ambitions; to make the most of this one needs to view it in the context of the full specialisation.",4
33486,"Good lecturer and presentation. Some additional contents and details would be good, but this was a good start into HTML5",4
33488,"Great course, great teacher. I liked all a lot!",4
33489,"The course is basic, for introducing the HTML5, which suit for absolute beginner.",4
33490,"Five stars for emphasis on accessibility, explanation and detail of semantic elements.Three stars for course content testing prior to publication and for omission of Linux. I use sftp on a command-line interface and did not learn in this course how to use mput for putting multiple HTML files and web assets onto my live site. There is no hyphen in ""meta-data"", nor are there two hyphens in ""local area network.",4
33497,This is an Wounder Full course its very sad that i can afford it for certificate but if YOU can u should go for it.Don`t wait don`t think Just go For it,4
33503,Nice course. But there are several videos where video an audio are out of sync which is very displeasing,4
33504,It was a very good course. I understood everything. My only complaint is that the tests questions were repetitive and so it would be easy to cheat on a second or third attempt and also the final quiz should have been more about writing your own code. I think what should have been tested was the end product by the autograder rather than the exact code. I'm not sure how that would work but it would result in a more precise grade rather than the 87.5% everyone gets and also help the student write his/her own code rather than proofreading and selecting others. I did thoroughly enjoy the course and am looking forward to Course two of the series on CSS3.,4
33508,"The instructor, Colleen van Gent was great! Great material for the beginner. I highly recommend this.",4
33512,"I thought the course was great! I understood the lectures well and was able to get coding quickly and efficiently. I also appreciated the emphasis on accessibility. The only note: one of the lectures of validation is actually after already have done some validation, but might be more useful before it.",4
33532,some quizzes would not work on my mobile and the final test was VERY hard. But overall a,4
33540,Its a good opportunity to learn latest technologies.And resources that you are providing to learn are really good,4
33547,I would like that the course propose more practical exercises.,4
33551,"Lectures are great. Colleen sounds very amiable. She has great tips.Downside: You're only required to do some coding for the final project. I think this course would be better if they'll add an in-browser editor so students could play with code after a lecture.Yes, I do play with code after the lecture to get around it, but I think the way the lectures are presented tempt the students not to. So any additional prompts such as in-browser editor - for in-lecture quizzes - definitely will help.",4
33561,"I was expecting more coding exercises and the major task was only the demo page which I completed and validated, but somehow I always failed that answer wrong in the final quiz",4
33569,"Overall I learned a lot. The course covered the topic of HTML 5 and the concepts behind the internet (hosting, protocols, DNS, etc.)I like that it was purely quiz/project based and no grading was done as peer review. However, occasionally (about 1/20) some of the quiz problems were just plain wrong. Also, the final project was a bit too strict and needed more fuzzy logic for the parser. One could produce visually identical and 100% valid results and still not get a perfect score. That seems a bit flawed to me. However, if you really want to labor on it, you can just give the quiz what it wants and eventually get a full score.All-in-all, I would recommend the course.",4
33570,"This course was quick, easy and fun, plus giving best practice pointers. Thanks!",4
33574,Really great for a beginner with no prior HTML experience.,4
33581,Great course for beginners who have absolutely no idea about coding! Huge thanks to Prof. Colleen who used very simple language to make the course easier to understand. All the important aspects of basic HTML5 were covered. Assignments were challenging and fun! I can proudly say that I created my own 'First' webpage with the help of this course. One star less just because I felt that some topics like images and especially multimedia usage can be confusing and could have been explained more in detail. Overall a very informative course...highly recommended!!,4
33584,Basic but very helpful course! I highly recommend for those who just begin to learn web design.,4
33598,"Great intro, though it was too slow at first then too fast toward the end. Could have used some more work.",4
33622,3th week final assignment has bugs,4
33624,Very Good Course and contents. Colleen has explained every concept very deeply and descriptively.I have enjoyed the learning.,4
33629,Is a good course,4
33633,It is a great course and the instructor has such a great way to teach that it's very easy to understand the content. Theres is only one thing left... more excercises.,4
33639,A very comprehensive course for coding beginners.,4
33641,A decent non-overwhelming course to start front-end development.,4
33645,"Great course for beginners, if you have programming background you will find it easy!",4
33654,"Very clear, it definitely worked for me.",4
33676,Excellent Course and Instructor! I would highly recommend this course to any new student interested in learning more about HTML and web development. The course is designed to provide the student with an introductory knowledge of HTML coding and introduces concepts in a very easy to understand manner.,4
33679,A good head-start to learning HTML5.,4
33680,"Good,but I think somewhere is not clear.",4
33685,Got to learn Cool new concept and tags. :),4
33687,"Great course, with a good speed and information to start your journey to create websites.",4
33696,"More hands-on practice, more exercises like the one on Week #2 where we(the students) follow the professor's step by step instruction into coding, and not so much lecture (though lecture its understandable as we need to learn all these definitions and what we are actually doing).",4
33699,"Thank you for the course! It was challenging in some way and VERY interesting. Besides, it is really stimulating in terms of self-learning as some aspects are mentioned but briefly. Personally I had some trouble with navigation, which made me spent a lot of time browsing the Internet for some information. But as they say no pains, no gains:)Thank you, Colleen! Looking forward to CSS course.",4
33701,Very good course. Looking forward to go to next level,4
33703,Thanks for helping us build a foundation right with the basics.,4
33705,Course covers the important basics and is an excellent starting point for people who want to learn HTML5,4
33707,"The course content was presented at steady pace and the videos were clear and direct.However, the auto-grader was really confusing for the final project.",4
33709,"'Introduction to HTML5' course is a very general introduction to HTML5 for beginners. The professor doesn't assume you know anything about Web development or even how files are uploaded to a host website. The course covers a brief history of the Web, basic HTML5 elements, URL terminology, Accessibility, Semantics, and basic FTP & Web hosting software like C-Panel. Forms and other advanced topics are not covered.The class is presented in a laid back style and uses non-technical language which is easy to understand. The quality of the video and audio are excellent. Supplemental books (pdf) and links to Youtube videos are provided and are useful.The duration of some of the lectures seemed too long, even when using 2X playback speed. With some of the quizzes, the professor expected you to read her mind and were worded in a subjective manner.The Accessibility section seemed a little too preachy for me. Also, the final project was convoluted and the instructions were vague. The final project really ended up being a 9 or 10 question quiz that gave you hints on how to code the final project.In summary, take this course if you are a complete beginner. Otherwise, you won't learn much if you have more than 2 months of experience in front end Web development.",4
33710,"Good for beginner, but I think it would be better to add more practice in the course.",4
33718,"A lot of repetitive information here, throughout each lesson. I was expecting a bit more coding opportunities. However, I'm not new to HTML and think this is still a good introduction for brand-brand new coders (like ages 12-15). Good refresher for those out of it for a decade or so (like me).",4
33721,"I learned a lot of new things, although I am not a beginner. But I think for a newbie this course is a little tough. It would have been great if I got something to share about my accomplishment in the free version too. But may be that's asking too much! On the whole I am happy with the course.",4
33723,Very good course but more assignments should be included except the quizzes ....,4
33724,"Couple hiccups with the autograder, but otherwise this course was very good. After messing around with HTML for years, it was about time I learned what the deal with HTML5 is. Just the right length, and definitely an Easy level of difficulty.",4
33728,"This is a very nice introductory course. Although I have experience with HTML, I appreciate the fact that it assumes no previous knowledge and takes the time to show beginners how to create and save an HTML file for the first time, as well as some of the editors that are available. Three weeks is a bit short, in my opinion. I would have liked to see forms being covered a bit, even if the actual handling is postponed until JavaScript is covered. I was also expecting for the canvas tag to at least be mentioned.Overall, an excellent course for beginners!",4
33730,This course really helped me a lot in learning HTML and basics of web developmentThanks for this course.,4
33741,"I liked this course and the professor was good, just wished they gave an extra week.",4
33753,For beginners this is a good course to start with. I don't recommend this course for experienced programmers.,4
33756,"I like the course, but I'd like to have deeper information about HTML5 and more exercises for learning and practicing. Also, there's few info about hosting and managing your website. Hope i'll find it in sooner courses of this university.",4
33758,"Good introduction to HTML 5, I like the way it explains about disabilities.But the final test, was just a battle to pass the parser more than the code itself.",4
33769,A good introduction to HTML5.,4
33771,"Colleen, the instructor, was very good. The autograder was not good and wasted people's time.",4
33781,Ok but too easy!,4
33783,"Overall I found the course to do exactly what it said. Give you the very basics of HTML and allow you to put something out there. For someone that has zero experience with programming or creating web pages I would recommend, otherwise it will definitely be a little too beginner.",4
33789,Shoud have big project that covers most of the new tags in HTML5However the lectures are awesome. Thanks for sharing..,4
33795,"Overall this is a very good course. I had some experience with HTML5, but this course showed me the nuances of standard practice that I was otherwise missing. The instructor was very articulate and offered example with every topic.",4
33796,"The glitches with the autograder at the end were the only reason I didn't give this five stars. Otherwise, great course! Looking forward to joining CSS3.",4
33803,"It should be little more elaborative with codes, syntaxes etc instead of non-html related stuffs",4
33804,"This is a complete HTML5 course of which students can learn and practice since this skill is very useful in today's programming market. Highly Recommended for begnners, intermediate, advanced, and professional programmers.",4
33805,How can i get certificate please,4
33807,"Excellent introduction to Chemistry, focused on models which allow you to understand all of the empirical rules/laws. However, it appears to be an older course and some of the quizzes were effected by Cousera upgrades and they are corrupted and some questions can't be answered (as in some cases there are actually no choices given!).",4
33809,"Great course! This is the first MOOC that I've completed and I had a great experience overall. The CDS system is what drew me toward this particular chemistry course and it seems like an effective and natural way to have concepts stick in your head. Very clear and easy to understand explanations are also given in the lecture videos.My only complaints are that there are some significant typos in the quizzes, and all of the course material seems to refer to a different version of the online textbook than the one that is currently provided. If the quality of the quizzes was better and if the course was more in sync with the most up-to-date reading material I would have easily given this course 5 stars.",4
33813,Very Good Videos for Chemistry!,4
33833,"great course! Unlike other courses, this one really helps the student make a deeper understanding of chemistry and the conceptes that built the science!",4
33834,Course information is delivered in a new and exciting format. The first half of the course builds up base Chemistry ideals and Laws. The second half takes the student to places they never thought they would end up. Be sure to brush up on your College Algebra before taking. Overall a fun and challenging experience!,4
33840,Thanks for this creative course that learned us different ways andaspects of image making.,4
33841,"Very challenging and very rewarding to learn to ""see"" an object, to start owning it and to realize a booklet out of it. It was hard work and lots of trials and errors, but I really enjoyed it, and I'm sure that I've learnt a lot for my next projects.",4
33843,Good introduction to important workflow concepts for creating and designing publications from scratch,4
33856,"Nice class introducing the ideas of scale, composition and use of white/negative space. A must for people who always want to fill the page. Sometimes less is more.",4
33858,I liked how there's such an open approach to the course and it gave me a lot of chances to practice design.,4
33862,This course was a fun one that encouraged experimentation and making a lot of images. I would say the assignments could have been more challenging though.,4
33871,Challenging and great!,4
33873,This course is very good for beginners of using images and need to know how to set images together and anyone did not studied graphic design before,4
33875,Really enjoyed the challenges it made me face with designing my own booklet.Has inspired me to do more.,4
33900,"Good course, maybe more detailed information would be better.",4
33902,Very interesting through creative assignments you can learn and refine things about image telling.,4
33916,Very enjoyable and encouraging course - I haven't used watercolours since I was a child and this course prompted me to go back out and try them again!,4
33919,"Very good course with fun and challenging assignments. My only criticism of this series of courses (the graphic design specialization) is the grading process and lack of instructor interaction. While the peer grading is setup so that it's not too difficult to receive a decent grade if you do the work, there is virtually no instructor feedback on assignments, which is a bit dissapointing. I realize this may be due to the huge number of students, but usually when I pay for a class, interaction and feedback from the instructor is part of the package. Perhaps if you did that, though, then the tuition cost would be much higher.",4
33921,Loved it. More non graded assignments would have been great.,4
33928,"Gail Swanlund is awesome. Her voice is amazing and fun to listen to. She explains things in a very creative way. So far, this has been my favorite among the Graphic Design Specialization courses. Still have two more courses to go yet!",4
33931,"I started 2 Hours ago.... it's amazing, such good teachers !",4
33932,"This course teach you to think out of the box and if you have the courage and try, you will take it for the rest of your life.",4
33933,"I love taking courses by the California Institute of the Arts. With that being said this course wasn't the best. It seemed there was not enough information provided. The assignments were too simple. It also seemed like this very material was covered in an earlier course. At least it was available for everyone, not just those that paid. The critiques are the most important part and it was still provided for this course. For that reason alone I raised my review from 2 stars to 4.",4
33934,"If you enjoyed the first course in this specialization, you'll enjoy this course, as it's much of the same. The class is more of an independent studio session rather than an instructional course. If you're looking to work with a single visual subject for a few weeks (but lack the discipline or knowledge to do so on your own), this course will benefit you. If you're looking to save money, perhaps stick to just the first class in the specialization (or take this one if you're only interested in image-making).",4
33937,GOOD COURSE,4
33939,"I really enjoyed this course and it was one of the most helpful along with the Typography course, but it felt a little impersonal and short on information when I compare this one to the previous ones. I would love to look at more examples of imagemaking and uses of hierarchy.",4
33943,"Much of the course seemed to cover what was previously discussed. About the only thing this course did for me was to introduce me to In Design. The teacher was OK, but she seemed to lack enthusiasm, particularly when she was demonstrating the book-binding.",4
33949,"Informative, but not as involved as the previous ELL courses.",4
33955,Could be more engaging but consists of a whole lot of relative information.,4
33963,"Great course series that forced me to take some steps (design docs) that I'd normally skimp on, and in doing so, realizing their true value.Throughout Coursera I'd love to see more instructor involvement in the courses. The 100% peer review system is a double edge sword. On one hand, I never felt I had an instructor looking at my work, but on the other hand, where else can you get constructive critiques on the internet ;-)Overall, great experience. Star-- for feeling a little bit on rails, and not feeling the instructor involvement.",4
33966,The course is interesting and serves its purpose - you WILL be able to make a simple game once you complete it.,4
33969,Some of the videos are really good. Unfortunately I feel there is little actual help to complete a project in the given time.The great thing about this course is the feeling of publishing your own game. That is priceless :),4
33973,Peer reviews are very unfair.,4
33975,Excellent capstones. But it would be mush better if there would be some lectures on Kongregate with example and exercises.,4
33983,It was a lot of theory and peer evaluations and I didn't have enough time to practice the last 3 weeks. I would divide the last in more weeks,4
34002,"This is a great course if you want to understand how genes contribute to evolution and their roles in determining various phenomenon that occur in our bodies and in other life forms in nature, as well as the basics of evolution. Dr.Noor is an absolute delight.",4
34011,"Be aware that the beginning overview lectures of this course are radically different than the detailed lectures that come later.The beginning of this course should be sent to anyone that ever tells you that evolution is not a ""thing"": :DAfter that, be prepared to do a lot of listening to Big A little a and minutia about how genetics really works.This is a really good course.... not perfect, but really good. One star is removed because I think I would have preferred a bit more development and overview of the ""bigger picture"" (I fell asleep at times). I sometimes lost the concepts that I was interested in learning through the barrage of details, but for someone who is very seriously studying the subject, then it would be 5 stars.Prof Noor is a good speaker: clear and has a nice voice and personality.",4
34018,Professor Noor is very friendly and clear in his lectures. He also answers questions in the discussion foruns with speed and detail. I was able to learn a lot from this course and challenged myself to a heavier load of lectures than I had expected because they were not boring at all. My only caveat is that the questions in his quizzes can sometimes be unnecessarily confusing because of wording or tricks.,4
34032,"This is a beutiful course, very well designed. Its a very tough topic but the instrucotr makes all efforts to make it easy to understand. Sometimes one has to go back and listen again but he gets the points across. I am thoroughly enjoying the course and understanding about genetics, genetic drift, selection, sweeps, and so many difficult concepts.",4
34045,very interesting. I regret that we are not allowed to discuss the exam questions (of course after the dead line) for a better understanding.,4
34054,informative,4
34062,"Very interesting course, with old jazz music at the beginnings of the videos!",4
34066,"Very well made, deep, good quality, thoughtful, and inspiring. Merci beaucoup! Merci de m'enseigner français!",4
34067,"This course was amazing, I need to continue, to go further on the same matters...I encourage people to join this course the next intake.",4
34070,"Excellent introduction. However, there are flaws with the English subtitles",4
34071,Great step-by-step introduction to Chinese Characters! Filled with historical background to help understand the underlying meaning of the characters and not just the image.It would be nice to have a complete vocabulary for the whole class that we can download and use!,4
34076,This course is good for someone who has the basic knowledge about Chinese language and wants to study more. It should be better when there are the sentences examples of using each word.,4
34078,"It was easy to learn several chinese characters. But some grammar was demanded in the exercises, although it was not taught during the course.",4
34080,This course covered exceedingly relevant topics to help health system participants wrap their minds around the changes taking place with value based payments and care coordination. I hope that with time some of the rough edges with the lectures and quiz questions get ironed out. I would absolutely look forward to an advanced version around interoperability and more in depth analytics.,4
34082,"The course gives you a overview of infrastructure financing and its key aspects. It is a good starting point and could be used to understand the major concepts of infrastructure financing in a short period. However, detailed modelling for projects is not covered in the course.",4
34088,"The course offers a broad overview of project finance issues. While the materials' (video, slides) quality is outstanding, I wish the tests would be more challenging.",4
34091,Nice course! the slide should provide the same info of the video to have a quick reference,4
34093,Clear and useful.More real study cases would have been a plus.As the analyses of failures investments.PFI mechanisms and impacts are not integrated. That's is missing.,4
34107,great course to learn the foundations of infrastructure finance,4
34109,"It's quite a nice course. It gives you a thorough overview of the particularities of infrastructure investing. The quizes are well done, they really force you to pay attention to the content.The audio was not always top notch, which made it difficult to set the playback speed; but overall, pretty solid course.",4
34110,"I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance. Such as real financial close considerations in developed and emerging markets, early stage sub performance and restructuring as well as refinancing. I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects. There were highlights on impacts of Basel on long tenor financing, but more market considerations of new players and structures would have been invaluable.",4
34135,"Start your own, getting ""the Jack of all"" mindset is very important to become Entrepreneurship in own business or corporate work culture. Great module, smart learning. Thanks!",4
34144,Good quick general overview for a complete beginner. Wished it could have been longer with a bit more depth.,4
34145,To the point and informative,4
34147,This course is great if you're just looking for a general overview about Entrepreneurship. I enjoyed learning about what things to expect as an entrepreneur as well as the do's and dont's for running your own business. It was really helpful to learn from someone who has real life experience as an entrepreneur.,4
34148,"I loved this course, I know have a better understanding of how a Business runs.",4
34149,Overall very useful for anyone looking to start or invest in a business. Can be done quickly but still had enough detail to make it useful.,4
34161,Videos were a little slow. I would prefer more slides and factual information to memorize and then videos as an option to hear opinion and real time experience.,4
34165,"The content is extremely practical for a new entrepreneur or person who is thinking about becoming an entrepreneur. It's engaging, succinct and actionable.",4
34168,"Very nice overview. The time is short but the teacher adds a lot of his personal experience, and that makes the difference. Thank you for the opportunity!",4
34171,Great C,4
34178,Great course to learn how to start a Business,4
34180,This course offers a good general overview on the essentials of entrepreneurship.,4
34193,It is a good course for those who want to be a entrepreneur but don't really know what that means. The course gives a lot to think about and consider when opening a business. It is also a quick and easy to learn course.,4
34197,"Good course, interesting information, but tests were not always clear for me (could not clear understand what it is asking about).",4
34201,Its very good introduction to topic and concepts.,4
34205,"Good high level overview for someone considering entrepreneurship or trying to map out what skills they need to prioritize. If you're already in the game -- skip it, too basic.",4
34209,The lecture is short but the presenter has good experiences to share with us. Module 4 is the essential of whole lecture.,4
34210,Learned plenty about the foundations of entrepreneurship.,4
34216,very interesting with some great,4
34229,Good info but limited. I would like to see some more in depth series based on the topics touched in this class.,4
34247,Good course. Providing more analogy to concepts will make it more interesting.,4
34258,"Prof. Northcraft goes straight to the point, very clear concepts and ready to use.",4
34265,"a little too easy, but great material and fantastic teacher",4
34269,Excellent practical content . addresses the challenges leader face on daily basis.,4
34271,"Great course. my constructive criticism has to do with the organizing of the group activities, it's just very difficult to organize into groups via people whom you have not met, especially given the time zone differences as well the differences in daily schedules for group members. I just wonder if there's a possibility to organize the group projects in such a way that the website allows for better asynchronous work (not just emailing back and forth as that feels very disorganized)? Otherwise I feel that I learned a lot and I feel that this is a great intro class.",4
34274,Great one!,4
34275,Great course!,4
34282,Informative,4
34288,"Useful course. Interaction is not on par with in-person, but other than that the course is great. I should say, that I have already started getting the value from the key learnings at my daily job and personal life. This is the best indication that the course was made right.",4
34293,A little light in terms of depth but very well structured and clearly presented.,4
34298,Informative.. Lacks interaction...,4
34308,"The course was very informative and practical. I liked that it had case studies that needed working with others. However, if there is a way that mentors from the university could also grade the case study assignments, it would be useful. When I graded, I didn't look for the exact use of terminology but if my coursemate had documented the idea, I gave a positive grade. People could have a bias to the grading. At times I found people randomly added me probably to access the case study but didn't bother to discuss. In a future upgrade of the course, if the university can assign teams and track progress somehow it would be great. Perhaps limit the number of entries to each course and assign a mentor per few groups. I enjoyed it however and learnt alot which I will apply to my work. Thank you.",4
34322,"Course contents was good , assignments were challenging . One suggestion is to provide pdf for each classroom session or may be a weekly pdf would be great , It so happened that attending each quiz without pdf it was hard to search from video/transcript back and forth",4
34326,Great overviez on Hardware Security,4
34329,Complete course in order to have a clear overview of HW security. I would recommend it to all HW engineers or System Engineers as well.,4
34334,"It is a great intro course with very rich information about hardware security. But just as some other students have mentioned, the difficulty level of each assignment is not well balanced, and Week 6 videos are out of order.",4
34339,The content is rich but the way of teaching is dull.,4
34353,"Ni hao, This course has given me a jump-start in learning a new language. The instructor laoshi YuBin is very talented and i respect her very much for the effort put by her. I would encourage more people to take this course and learn the language.",4
34364,Very nice and instructional. Some minor mistakes here and there (it had two lectures with the videos in the wrong order). Looking forward to the next ones.,4
34377,"A very good short course on an important intellectual trait, the intellectual humility. The videos were very informative, and the lecturers did not require a prior knowledge on philosophy or psychology. I managed to complete the course even though I did not have more than 2-3 hours per week.",4
34378,"The course gives a good basic insight to the topic of intellectual humility although in the beginning it fails a little in telling why intellectual humility is so important. (roughly the message was: ""you get along better with other people and yourself"")As the question ""what is (intellectual) humility"" is more a philosophical question than a practical experience this course cannot provide you with a tool that helps you to be more humble within a few days, to improve your humility and to measure someone elses humility but the course helps you asking yourself the right questions. (""Is social status important to me? Can I accept different opinions?...)It was my first coursera experience and I am satisfied with it. However, the videos are a bit oldfahsioned in style - if it was intended to give the videos an antique look - well done ;-)",4
34387,"Very interesting subject and well structured course, with good exposition of the subject. Looking forward into Part 2! Knocked one star off (would be half if I could) just because there is some discontinuity between the three sections/speakers and still a couple of rough edges to smooth out.",4
34396,"The course is a great intro to excel, but there are some errors in a few of the data examples (good practice data cleansing!)",4
34399,"Course is really helpful in understanding excel tools such as vllokups, indexing, pivot table, logical functions etc. I am a mechanical engineer and need to use excel for data analysis. This course really helped me.",4
34404,a few mistakes during the course,4
34405,"I would give this course a 4.5 if I could. I liked the course overall, but felt that there could have been more explanations with the answers to the weekly projects. For answers I couldn't solve, I had to look at the solutions and back out the correct formula to teach myself sometimes. I thought the videos were very helpful, but sometimes hard to follow since the text being input in the video was hard to see.",4
34407,Great course! Very informative. Thanks PWC and Coursera for this course.,4
34409,I learned a lot and was able to take my Excel skills to another level. Some of the practice assignments had formulas that weren't discussed - whi,4
34412,Useful tips and tricks to become a stronger excel user,4
34417,"The course is well structured, but some of the files are not properly audited so there are mistakes which can lead to wrong answers in the quizzes.",4
34426,This is a great course to provide someone with the basic foundation in Excel.,4
34429,"I learned something new every week and the projects at the end of each week were thoughtful and robust. Overall, well worth the time.Frustrations - sound quality varied widely and could be frustrating. Would have preferred significantly more examples, was difficult to really grasp some concepts with such limited practice and implementation examples. Found mistakes in some portion of nearly every week's lessons, which makes it challenging to learn new material and one week was particularly sloppy.",4
34438,I do not want to pay for quizes while learning.,4
34439,Clearly explained walk-through of many Excel features. Well structured. Full worksheet view in videos meant that individual cell contents were hard to see on my smaller screen.,4
34441,"GREAT, COMPREHENSIVE",4
34444,"Good Course! However, a few errors in the exercises; regardless, they made me better in the end. A few minor issues with poor video/audio quality on the exercises. Still, a worthwhile course.",4
34449,"In general, this is a good course. It provides many handy tools. But I still wish it had provided a larger scope of other tools we could learn in the future, even if the course doesn't teach these. In essence, I learned much, but my horizon wasn't broadened much.",4
34452,In general the course is very well structured and to the point. In some demonstartions it is hard to see the formula syntax as it can not be more enlarged. In some videos the sound is not clear.,4
34453,"Good explanation, good examples. However, I found some mistakes in tasks.",4
34455,"Good course, learnt a few new things even though I am very experienced with Excel. I found some of the exercise / project questions a bit confusing (not the task itself, but the way it was described - instructions were not always clear, and sometimes contained errors).",4
34458,"The content is really nice and useful, but some screen-recorded lecture could have better audio and video quality.",4
34469,The course was very informative!,4
34476,"This is a pretty good intro to Excel course. It gets a little patchy in Weeks 3 and 4 (it seems like some of the worksheets weren't checked for errors), but it never wastes your time. It's a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonly-used professional functions in Excel. I'm glad I took it, though I do wish there had been more of a progression. For example, it would have been nice if there was a final, project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in Week 4.",4
34480,All of the content for the program was excellent. The only issue I had was that the video quality on some of the instructor lead excel examples within the video was very small and I could not read it. I found it difficult to follow especially I had to go over it three or four times increasing the screen etc. in order to get what I needed from the instructor lead examples otherwise it was an excellent class. I believe it more than prepares someone not aware of all the capabilities of Excel to see the possibilities and to apply them going forward in business or in their personal life.,4
34484,"Some topics were rather basic; however, this is a great and insightful course for beginner/intermediate Excel users on how to leverage the tools in Excel in data analytics!",4
34486,I learned many skills that I can apply on the job.,4
34490,Its very helpful as basics of excel which we tend to forget are again revisited here and many minute details have been,4
34494,"Though i use MS excel on daily basis, but this course has shown me new ways. Glad i joined in.",4
34500,Not very difficult. The quizzes require little effort with any prior knowledge of excel. Good for low level users. The data cleanup stuff was the most useful to me.,4
34505,Good Intermediate level course. Including useful functions we experience being part of Finance profile. Thanks,4
34526,a little succinct and could have gone in to far more chemistry details.the teachers are a little difficult to understand at times and a little repetitive as well but overall an enjoyable course,4
34534,"Since I started this course it has helped me to change my thinking and the way I am trying to find the solution to improve the working enviroment of my working place and the people I am working with.I can rate this a a successfull course for any one.what I missed from this course is the interaction between the lecturer and the people who are learning the course.W e have missed the taste of coaching.Thank youGabriel Paul KissimaKaratu,Arusha, Tanzania",4
34536,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and feel it's content was very relevant. However, it felt outdated in some respects and at times a little hard to follow. But, well worthwhile for anyone in Healthcare!",4
34537,Interesting,4
34545,Very nice and clearly presented. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that I would have liked more details and more lectures.,4
34558,This is an excellent course for those who want to get a better understanding about the brain and how it processes everyday stimulus. The professor is without doubt very knowledgable and explains everything in a very professional and yet simple way.,4
34563,"Simple yet efficient, clear material, good explanations",4
34573,Good course for people wanting to get more active. Lots of good information and the how-tos to make it work for you.,4
34576,Good motivator to take first steps in keeping oneself active. Simple tips provided which once used in day to day life will definitely change our sedentary lifestyle,4
34578,Very informative course :) the quizzes were a little too obvious (just my own opinion!) I did not feel challenged during them.,4
34579,"This course is very beneficial to people who are not usually active, but if you are an active person then you'll probably learn about measuring your physical activity. Otherwise it is very very very very easy, like if you had to fail that would just be sad",4
34605,This course gave me some nice encouragement tips to get started on a new healthier path!,4
34607,ok course.....motivational,4
34608,Could add a lot more exercise specific information.,4
34611,"fun! Informative and light, a reminder to get up and get moving!",4
34620,Quick class that gave me some inspiration to get moving!,4
34627,"Very motivating and highly informative. I'll recommend for everyone, irrespective of age or sex.",4
34628,A useful course that gives practical guidelines on increasing physical activity in daily life. It specifies that even as low as 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise 5 times a day can be very beneficial to an otherwise sedentary person.,4
34637,Very good course with good information. I just need to keep doing the things I learned.,4
34639,Good basic background for starting out. I wanted a little more but no complaints. Good simple instructions and knowledge build including the SMART principle,4
34641,It was very informative course. Thanks for great job,4
34645,It was a fun course!,4
34647,Excellent course. It's easy but inspirational in nature.,4
34651,"This course is a good introduction to getting active, and it provides a plethora of useful resources that can help you get started.",4
34661,"I wish this was more extensive /detailed course and assignments little bit more complex. The moderator timely response was greatly lacking. If the course instructor is asking the students to try out RDD while the auto-grader depends on SQL, it should have been clarified.",4
34662,"Nice Course. Going straight forward to the manipulations using spark, and giving a great overview on how to deal with IoT data in the Cloudant NOSQL platform. Would hope to see a new course where we can use MLLIB with massive IoT data to showcase the power of parallel programming!",4
34664,"Good course with a good Instructor. It's a real basic course and good for beginners, though you need to have to dive into Python and Spark on your own to follow the course and the assignments. :)",4
34665,The Grader template in the beginning is very confusing when doing first assignment. The response from Instructor should be quick.,4
34667,Really good course to provide an overview of working within IBM's cloud platform offerings. This course provides the basics of ApacheSpark as well.,4
34669,I learned new concepts and about the efforts of so many organisations towards Health For All. It definitely increased my interest in Public Health studies even more.,4
34674,Thank you for the opportunity to learn from Johns Hopkins University. I was a great learning experience although improvements should be made in the grading process which took unusually longer.,4
34682,"Good organized course, Health for all through primary health care described well in context of developing regions.",4
34686,"Great content! Mixing lectures, articles and videos gave several perspective on the topics and made the content more interesting. Peer reviews of papers varied drastically based on the reviewer so may not be the best way for grading.",4
34692,Very good introduction! I only miss more examples of urban/regional planning or transportation networks.,4
34694,Great course,4
34712,"I have learned a lot in this course. It is very nice, but I think that it would be nice if the students can communicate with the teacher directly, because sometimes there are some comments or questions and it is only read it by the group.",4
34717,"In general, it's quite helpful for me, but it could be a little bit too fundamental sometimes, for example the professor would explain things like how to find a button... which may not be so necessary, but it's ok, I think I will enroll the next course of this series.",4
34729,This class was very beneficial and well-organized. Thank you for all of the valuable information!,4
34754,It was an Excellent Course I learned a lot and it was a great opportunity to learn GIS basics.Thank you so muchNick Santos (our instructor) and the UC Davis Extension Team,4
34767,"Contains a lot of great content through videos and demonstrations that are easy to follow and in depth enough to understand the concepts. Would be great if there was a way to contact the professor or someone within Coursera to help with technical issues, as I ran into quite a few of those along the way and did not have anyone to reach out to (not a problem with the actual course, just the courser",4
34768,This is the best course; The teacher explains very well.It`s too easy to understand his lessons.,4
34778,"This course gives a good overview of GIS. It helps in becoming familiar with ArcGIS software and also teaches a lot of fundamentals that can be generally applied to different GIS products as well. But looking at the expenses of using ArcGIS for commercial purposes, it would have been great had there been some sort of additional, optional demonstrations of other products.. For a small-medium business, ArcGIS doesn't seem viable at all.",4
34791,Great hands-on exercises to boost understanding and develop required skills...,4
34793,Good teaching methods. Convenient for starting to get to know GIS software and sharing your map data.,4
34797,Great course for the beginners !,4
34800,"I found a number of the lessons were light on content, but I have guilty knowledge having used ArcMap on and off for the past few years. A lot of the meat of this course is replicated in similar or only slightly more detail in the follow-on class in the specialization. If you have experience with GIS or Arc I would strongly recommend skipping this class and moving directly to GIS Data Formats, Design and Quality.",4
34815,Great introduction to GIS using ArcGIS,4
34821,"Well constructed, excellent course. Learned a lot.",4
34838,"Good introduction, also for beginners.I found it rather easy, but maybe getting more complex with the further courses in the specialisation.",4
34839,I really love the course but I dont understand whether this part of the course is free or is not.,4
34849,"Excellent course, well-explained and complete! It does need a lot of focus and practice to actually understand and master what's going on there.",4
34859,"A good introduction to GIS focusing on the fundamental principles with a good practical element included. There is a lot to take in over four weeks so it does require plenty of time to absorb all the required learning and complete the assignment. Plenty of information and resources are provided and the lectures are clear and easily to follow. The only criticism I would have is that there is probably too much emphasis on Arc GIS, it would have been nice to learn some more about open source platforms like QGIS.",4
34864,"The first week was a little slow, but I'm glad I stuck it out. This was very helpful and informative. The labs are invaluable practice that accompany the videos well. Thanks Nick!",4
34868,The course was fantastic. I would of liked more or longer videos.,4
34872,"Really good for beginners and if this course have more detailed instruction of final assignment, I would like to give five stars.",4
34884,you should consider issues to upload 54Mo data during peer review grading of last assignment.so this course was informative and well structured.thanks a lot,4
34898,"Great course with engaging material and enthusiastic and experienced instruction. The materials, lectures, assignments, extras, links, etc. were excellent. Only two negative aspects occurred. The first was the initial lack of materials with which to follow the instructors as they went through various processes in ArcMap in their lectures. However, this was remedied quickly and materials were provided. The second was the instructional material for the week 2 assignment, which lacked the step-by-step detail and polish of the assignments from other weeks. This may have been due to the course being new and somewhat unrefined. Overall, the course was extremely helpful and well worth the time and money. I intend to continue on and complete the entire specialization.",4
34904,I like the class. But It will be most useful if the student can use the same data than the instructor and follow instruction step by step.,4
34909,"Great course, right what I needed as I use with statistics and econometrics in development issues, but I needed to add the ""spatial"" element.I would give the 5th star, if the slide of the lessons were availablethanks!",4
34919,"It was good to get to work on an individual project at the end of the specialization. The requirements for the capstone were unclear as the videos present a huge project compared to the 4 weeks, 3-5 hours per week commitment indicated for this capstone and there is talk of self-sustainability for the solution etc. that ultimately is not in the review criteria.Applying common sense and scoping the project to the commitment does work out to a good learning by doing experience.",4
34932,Nice introductory course giving a overview from a comprehensive perspective. It focuses on USA but can be suitable for many countries. There are no practical activities. Very good teacher.,4
34934,Its a good course to begin with FHIR Technology . But I expected more technical detailing in the course module....,4
34937,This very good course to understand minute details of the topic easily.,4
34944,a very good intro but i feel it may do with more detail,4
34946,"Does a fine job of discussing the U.S. healthcare system. Further, did a fine job of explaining the potential of FHIR for the U.S. healthcare system.",4
34947,Great intro class to healthcare informatics,4
34953,"very good course, what interesting to me is the elaboration on the real world applications during this course.",4
34955,Nice and updated overview on Health IT. Just a general intro to some FHIR aspects :-),4
34956,"Would be great to have the slides available for reference. Also, future iteration may consider going a bit deeper. I loved the examples given in the course. Many thanks!",4
34957,"This was a great course as an introduction to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Hopefully it is followed up with a more technical course. The only thing I don't care for with FHIR is they pronounce it 'Fire' which smacks of cheesy marketing. Nonetheless, the course is worth it, and the instructor is very clear and thorough.",4
34958,"Really interesting and useful introduction to big data in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is on the verge of revolutionizing how we provide care in future while focusing on meaningful outcomes. This course provides you with a pretty decent background. The presentation itself is a little 'choppy' and heavy in informatics lingo, but the instructor does a great job and maintains interest. I will highly recommend this course to anyone who is 'curious' about big data in healthcare.",4
34968,One of the finest courses dealing with heritage and its conservation.,4
34972,Very knowledgeable and insightful discussions.,4
34975,Great course. Thank you.,4
35001,This is an interview Swiss-army knife and can be used equally effectively by candidates as well as those who interview candidates.,4
35009,it is amazing for learning the very fundamentals of the guitar.,4
35023,I liked the course overall. One star less for the duration and content alignment. It would have been much helpful if the content was spread over for a longer time period as a week wasn't enough to finish many assignments esp for beginners.,4
35024,"A very nice well-rounded intro to guitar.The amount of work really rises towards the end, but it does pay off.The only issue I have is with this course is the barre chords. They are dumped nonchalantly on the learners and we're just expected to pick them up. This part is very hard on the beginners.",4
35032,"Good course, but a bit too fast. Deadlines are too soon for the real begginers",4
35044,Had a great time participating in the class. I am happy I was able to upload samples and get feedback.,4
35050,Indeed a very useful course on Guitar. Thank you edX !,4
35071,I have been playing for many years but there is always things to learn or re-learn. I did both during this excellent course. Hogarth goes at a moderate speed. Especially helpful was the fact Mr. Hogarth speaks slowly and clearly. How nice!,4
35075,Easy to follow for begginers.,4
35079,"This course is great, I learned a player, I never had played.",4
35087,"Nice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering. The playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome. Outside of the necessary downloads, recordings, playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear. Position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the Instructor did a commendable job elaborating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvise.The reason not a 5 is that the grading is cumbersome and time-consuming to set up",4
35093,"Great course for learning the theory and techniques. It's difficult to master the new techniques/theory in only a week, but it builds a great foundation. After completing this course, the students should understand that there's still a lot of practice and time that needs to be put in, if playing fluently and effortlessly are the end objectives. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and plan on continuing to build upon what I learned.",4
35107,It's OK,4
35114,"good course and deadlines to keep us in track,but barre chords must be given more time to learn,and the course materials many are in just videos , please try to formulate all all the tab notations in pdfs as few were just in videos",4
35127,"Thaddeus is adept at touching on the very basic essentials of the guitar--electric and acoustic. I personally have learned so much from him. He's smart in his approach, articulate, and makes it so anyone of any skill level can learn how to play. Before, I always believed learning an instrument was such a daunting and insurmountable task, but with this course I find myself wondering why I never decided to take up guitar in the first place! That beings said, there are few caveats I will insert here which will explain why I gave it 4/5 stars: (1) This is an introductory course in its purest form. What do I mean by that? Well, if you have any prior knowledge of the guitar (as I had), you will find the beginning to be very, verrry slow. You will soon discover that you are not as ""beginner"" as you initially thought yourself to be. Hence, you will likely be frustrated, almost insulted by the seemingly obvious information being told to you. (2) Peer f*ing reviews: the the bane of my existence. Well, that's not entirely true. To be fair, they can sometimes be very helpful, but come on, to have to sit and evaluate five, fiiiiiiiive people's homework assignments can take away a pretty sizable portion of your day you didn't necessarily plan on allotting. I suppose it is a necessary evil, but to me it's just evil. A dreaded nuisance, in my opinion. (3) This class is metronome-friendly-centric-heavy. I'm not a metronome person, myself, and I never will be, even after all the times I felt like I was trying to be converted into one. It works for some, but not me..... In conclusion, please do not allow these thoughts to waver your decision on whether to take the course, but instead just be mindful of them. Take them with a grain of salt. My experience with the course may not be your experience. If you are committed to learning the guitar, this is a fabulous course to take that will, in fact, teach you a great deal of what you need to know. I'm only on Week 6, but I'm excited to be moving forward and gaining even more knowledge!",4
35130,nice teaching,4
35131,Great course,4
35138,I really enjoyed the course. I felt some quizzes were too hard for the material previously covered and required several attempts.,4
35141,I learned quite a bit from this instructor in a short period of time. He has a way of explaining things that really makes it sink in. The one thing I would change is not to have so many chords to learn in one week toward the end of the class. I would add a few weeks to the course.,4
35142,"The course is very good! Amazing how the elements are covered and explained. The only thing I missed was more exercises, more scales to practice.",4
35145,It is good to get started through this course. But the material could have been more clear.,4
35146,this is the best class to lear guitar i have got lear guitar rally nicely thanx,4
35151,"Very good! This course give you a solid introduction to the world of guitar. Easy to follow, clear explanations and examples. I strongly recommend it (and look forward hearing from the next one!)",4
35152,"This is a good beginner's course, with clear instructions guiding the student along a progressive path. I'm not convinced that the peer review system is of much use at this level.",4
35153,"While the course is definitely very good and thorough, the difficulty of each week is raising exponentially. First just learn one chord shape... then learn some picking techniques... then a small set of obscure and rarely used scales... and then suddenly a HUGE bunch of open chords, movable chords, power chords and a song too! Of course you got to play it all sounding nice and even like a metronome or your peers will pull your score down heavy. Maybe I'm not the most gifted guitarist, but I really felt like the learning curve here was just unfairly steep. I'm still giving the course 4 stars, because the material is still really good, but if you are beginner, be prepared to take it twice.",4
35158,"It's great, but I wish there was more in it.",4
35186,"Musical syllabus is challenging, but yields rewarding accomplishment upon completion of the course.There is insufficient staff monitoring and student support during the course. Be aware that you should be proficient in recording your music on your pc including being able to integrate chords and melodies of the same piece into one recording.Newbies to guitar need to begin finger flexibility and strengthening exercises before starting the course as it will be difficult to keep up with the course and the required practice time if you are struggling with finger soreness and fatigue.",4
35187,It's a useful course for me to learn guitar systematically.,4
35190,This is just what it says it is...an intro to guitar. Enjoy!,4
35210,Interesting professor. I am learning and having a lot fun,4
35212,Thadeus is very patient sounding and doesn't rush and explains things completely. Practicing really helps you keep up with the class.,4
35213,concept clearing and building strong enough!,4
35235,"Good introduction to basic guitar and musical concepts such as chord diagrams, tabs, musical notation. Good video lectures and challenging (for beginners) exercises after each lesson. Recording device of some type is required, even if as simple as a computer microphone and audacity.",4
35240,simple and fun,4
35250,"A good course with clear instructional materials and excellent presentation. However the reason it does not get 5 stars is that when I signed up to the GIS specialisation in April 2016 I was led to believe that course instructors would review my capstone project. Indeed, this was one of the incentives for me in signing on to the specialisation. I realise that with the number of students undertaking the course this did not become very practical, so that the capstone project was peer reviewed instead. I found this somewhat disappointing though as the feedback gained was often quite limited and it reduced the value of the Certificate.",4
35261,"There were some errors in the video playback, one entire lesson near the end seemed like it was skipped.",4
35268,Some quiz answers were marked wrong when they were correct,4
35276,This course is okay,4
35278,"a very interesting course, but the explanation is slow sometimes.",4
35280,"I enjoyed doing this course, however, couldn't get 80% correct in the last quiz, as I didn't quite grasp the DNA part. However, I did this course for fun and am quite content with 77%!!",4
35294,Well presented and easy to understand. It would be good to see more information relevant to high school aged children.,4
35313,this course is very complete in the aspect to learn different things to orientation in our lifes,4
35316,Useful primer on applying inclusive principles across spaces,4
35321,"To be honest I believed that this course would help me understand better transgender individuals, but it didn't. It feels like the instructors assumed I already accept this condition without question, the course is thought provoking of course, but not as informative as I thought it would be. I am more open to learn more about this topic though.",4
35327,"Great course, I really liked it. I found it very educating and enjoyed the interviews of the children most of all.I feel the class would benefit by discussing how gender roles are formed in society, why are pervasive through many aspects of society, how they are historically evolved, comparison in more aspects with the societies mentioned that are more open to gender fluidity etc. That would help us understand whether there is a necessity behind the gender roles or whether it is a natural step to drop them altogether, how they apply to other gender defined groups etc. I see why this would give the class a more society critical and perhaps political dimension however.",4
35349,Takes your ideals one step further.,4
35350,"I thought this course was mostly very well done. I would love to get in touch with the professor who created the course, and may try to reach out via other means. I am a transgender grad student at Mills College working on gender inclusive early childhood education.One note specifically for Coursera, though... The honor code validation use of ""legal name"" on a course about transgender rights/health poses a particular emotional barrier for transgender people taking the course. Many transgender people go by names that are not their legal name and may or may not be able to change their legal names due to complicated laws and requirements. Having folks sign using their legal name is a potentially hostile, if relatively passive, act towards some transgender folks taking this class.",4
35353,"nice course, but assginment would be designed better.",4
35365,This is the ONLY complete course on Python that I can find on Coursera.,4
35372,nice course for python newbies,4
35379,good python course！,4
35385,Too fast;,4
35387,It would be better if you discussed more about using python to process data,4
35388,I don't want to do the exercise.,4
35392,Pretty useful course!,4
35399,"It was very enlightening; it made me realize the complexities and evolution of diplomacy while understanding what it takes to become a good diplomat in general. Specifically, I got new insights on how I can impact positively within the realm of nature conservation from a global perspective and how to tackle the threats we are facing in the near future. I would have liked though a bit more interaction with the experts and opinions from them on my/our submissions.",4
35412,The course has given me a better understanding of the Diplomacy.,4
35414,This course is fascinating and the lecturers are so great.,4
35415,"Good course, but very introductory.",4
35420,The course provided a thorough grounding in Global Diplomacy and how it relates to the everyday world.,4
35425,Really enjoyed the course. Professors appear to be very competent and the lecture content is thoroughly interesting. Wish there was a bit more content overall.,4
35429,"The course was very interesting. I liked that I could share my views on diplomacy in the form of short essays and fellow peers could grade my work. In my opinion, the course could also include short quiz tests so that course participants practice the material more.",4
35430,I really enjoyed this course. It refreshed the theme and gave me more insight.,4
35437,"This is an educative programme. I have gained some knowledge in the subject area. It as increased my interest Global Diplomacy. Also opportunity to read more about the theory and practice of Global Diplomacy. It will go a long way to enhance my skills as a diplomate to influence leadership positively at all levels of life to build positive net work, develop appropriate diplomatic skills to enhance international relations, negotiations, and ensure peace and security in contemporary global world.",4
35451,The course provides an insight into the world of diplomacy with recent examples of failures and successes. I would highly recommend this course to policy makers and also to those seeking to widen their horizons in diplomacy.,4
35474,"A solid introductory course, with some interesting course materials and thought-provoking questions.",4
35475,"I am finding that the material is very relevant to our present era. I see now many news items which relate to the learning available in this course. I like writing about the topics, the activity firms up my understanding of those topics.",4
35485,"Highly recommended introductory course for anyone getting into experimentation. I found the starting point appropriate for total novices (though for someone with some background, the pacing felt very slow and repetitive at times), but there was a well-defined progression from the simplest to more advanced concepts.I would have appreciated some more theoretical content, both foundational and advanced, and the pacing/structure could use some rethinking to avoid staleness, but overall this is a very nice introduction to important aspects of design of experiments and optimization.",4
35492,excellent course and professor goes with a steady pace,4
35496,"Very nice topic, intresting examples and great classes.",4
35499,Great course. I wish there were homework assignments though to make it more engaging. One of the best courses I have taken in coursera,4
35508,A decent online course who taught me a lot of very useful information related to experimental design. High recommend. The only drawback is the course is a little be short.,4
35524,Peer-Grading assignment is not completely fair. Depending on them is not logical since not all of them are fully educated in this course that's the reason we're taking the course in the first place. but over all it is good and the proff is amazing.,4
35540,"I thought the ideas were presented well at first and it was easy for me (a novice in the subject) to keep up. However, it ramped up for the last two weeks. I ended up doing some more research before understanding the concepts. Great examples throughout. Ultimately, challenging (therefore rewarding). I look forward to the other courses in the Foundations series.",4
35551,Thank You Professor,4
35593,"Professor was very good, easy to learn. I only do not give it a 5 because I wish accrual accounting had been discussed more at length.",4
35594,"Beautifully delivered, made it easy to understand material that was new to me. I highly recommend",4
35595,"This is a very interesting course, I would hace liked the teacher would explain a little bit more about NOF and Operational ratios, go further on this topics and less analysisi of Balance Sheet and P&L.But in general, great explanations and videos and completely easy to understand everything, very good examples.",4
35596,Great course! Peer feedback has been less than helpful.,4
35600,Simply too good,4
35602,This is very good course for beginners and well explained wit practical example,4
35605,Great course learned a lot .Great step by step instruction.,4
35609,Interesting course with really useful information. Learning of course is easy because of many examples offered by teacher.,4
35610,"One of the most interesting courses of the specialization. Unfortunately, delivery is still in need of improvement. At least there was some good discussion around the slides, and not all slides were read verbatim. Interesting project at the end!",4
35612,"Nice course. It would be better if the PPT could be modified (reduce the words, add more figures or diagrams).",4
35613,"Good content, engaging assignments and valuable points that allow the students to better understand all indicated points.",4
35614,Quick and clear!,4
35640,Great course for introducing the fundamentals of hotel management and hotel distribution. This course enables us to learn important concepts related to hotel distribution and apply them in real-life situations through the course assignments. As well as this it is not necessary any relevant background to understand the concepts presented however it may be recommended basic financial/economics knowledge.I think that adding some quizzes during the videos would be interesting and productive as it would allow students to assure that all the concepts were understood.,4
35645,Very informative but the practice tests had some bugs in it.,4
35652,Very insightful. Highly recommended for anyone who is new to hotel revenue management. A good foundation course for hotel marketing and distribution.,4
35654,"The content of the course is basically on how hotels distribute their contents (their rooms to sale). The different channels are explained, such as the OTA, brand.com, meta search, and direct channels. The course also includes a very interesting point of view from OTA where Expedia and Booking.com explains their offers to hotels. I would love to have the views from hotel too, which are missing here.The suggested readings are quite a lot, basically from the online sites, many from the hotel and travel industry (skift, for example). Those readings are very useful in digging deeper on the subject.The assignments, are, on the other hand, quite weak. It consists of 4 peer review assignments. The first week contains a pretty quantitative analysis, but the other 3 assignments are basically conversational and just repeating what you have learnt in the class.The non-noted quizzes were pretty easy, you almost no need to think deeper to answer those questions.",4
35661,Test review for this course,4
35666,Subjects are not covered in depth but it's a comprehensive overview. Looking forward to the next courses in the specialization.,4
35676,So far it looks really cool,4
35681,I will pay attention to this course and the instructor is awesome because ii was my wish to teach in University of Tokyo and i am now with this platform.Thank you so much.,4
35689,"Widespread precise in-formation, giving strenght to go ahead",4
35690,"A great insight into rural and urban management which could be greatly improved with more challenging (longer) assignments. Great video material and instructors, but I would have enjoyed writing and peer assessing more in-depth articles as opposed to condensing as much information as possible into a simple 200-400 words.",4
35692,It is a great course if you want to learn about environmental technologies and how they work in different places around the world. The experience from several professors of the DTU is condensed in easy to follow and understand videos.,4
35697,Fantastic Course.,4
35698,It was a good change to resest my mind set on a broader view of enviro management,4
35701,I just fell in love with the course from the first experience I had. Hoping to eventually rate it has 5 star,4
35704,This course gave me a new prospective about what's going on in environmental management around the world and in Scandinavian countries,4
35719,This was better than the previous courses in that it gives more concrete information about where to find help in format and research needs. This makes it easier to apply and give feedback to other students.,4
35732,"One of the best courses by Coursera, it significantly helps me increase my knowledge.",4
35733,"very fundamental. however, I do think it was a bit bold to state that on completion of the course that students would have the skills to write essays independently. Following the grading of some peer assignments, I would be concerned if that were still the case.Otherwise, I found some useful tools for writing in all the courses.Thank you.",4
35744,"Very organized, gets you writing right away.",4
35745,Very difficult !!,4
35749,very good basic course,4
35751,"A bit too trivial, though usefu",4
35753,Very interesting look at the financial markets and institutions. It is particularly clear and well-explained for non-native speakers of Russian.,4
35758,"Not simple, interesting course! Thank You Coursera!",4
35759,"Good course, but too Russia-centric, especially the first two weeks (I prefer a more general approach). The course answers mainly the question ""how"" (how are money borrowed, how is IPO organized), but not ""why"" (why do described regulations exist, why are they the way they are, who is benefiting from that?).",4
35769,Excellent course for those taking the first steps into hi,4
35771,Enjoyed this. Lots of lectures by guest authors.,4
35774,A very interesting course with a fascinating subject I've been intrigued by for a while. It gave me many skills and techniques to think about as I attempt to eventually become a historical fiction writer myself someday. My only negative critique is that I wish it dealt with the witches and medieval aspects of the course in the beginning rather than towards the end.,4
35781,"I really enjoyed this course, I understand better the literature",4
35782,"I personally enjoyed the course. However I was disappointed when I was told after week (3 or 5?) that I'd completed the course, when I in fact hadn't gotten to the end and had not done the final two assignments...? Regardless, I went ahead and finished the course, but I was also disturbed to see that some of the students did their assignments in a mockery fashion e.g. wrote song lyrics, or stated ""I don't know what else to say so I will tell you about my day..."" That was very irritating. The class wasn't described clearly in the catalog, I thought it would be more of a history of the periods plus literature, but it wasn't exactly that... Instead it was a discussion of techniques and prose, and exhibiting truly talented authors. I liked the class, just not what I expected.",4
35784,Fun course I feel I learned a lot.,4
35788,A good introductory course to historical fiction and the mechanics of writing it.,4
35789,"This course was just what I was looking for, being a budding historical fiction writer myself. It made me authenticate that I was doing mostly everything right so far. I have three complete novels in my treasure trove and three as work in progress. Bringing in authentic authors of historical fiction gave me first hand tips, and precious insight into the experiences of real life writers just like me, who take true pleasure in what they do, and do best. I would indeed appreciate a sequel to this well put together course; the sooner the better! Congratulations, Professor Holsinger! Thank you, University of Virginia! P.S. I could do with a complimentary Certificate of Accomplishment, though.",4
35795,"I liked the curse a lot. However, I would consider some more gradings throughout the course, not just the few. Otherwise people lose their interest",4
35797,Lovely course for historical fiction enthusiast. There's a wonderful reading list required to read as well as multiple guest speakers besides the professor to help explain more about the genre.,4
35803,"A very interesting course. Only negative thing is that some of the authors are not very good at leading a lecture, and seem to stumble in their words a lot.",4
35808,Great course. I loved the seminars with the different authors. The course was fun and interesting and the professor was knowledgeable and easy to listen to.,4
35810,I really enjoyed this course. It was my first one in Coursera and it was very helpful to do it at my own pace. I found very useful advice regarding sources and research strategies. The seminars were very good and also the conversations. The sound could be improved but having subtitles helps to overcome the technical issues. Thank you.,4
35813,"I learnt a lot. The teachers could have been more engaged and interact with the studetns in turns, though.",4
35830,very comprehensive course. I recommend this course for everybody,4
35832,"I have enjoyed this course. It presented the one-health concept very clearly and what its aims are which were particularly interesting especially for me who is interested in antimicrobial resistance research. However, some improvements could be made. The presenters with accents / non-English speakers were a bit difficult to follow and the transcripts were somewhat inaccurate so it would be go to have proper transcription in that regard. Thank you.",4
35839,A very nice introduction. The instructor shows a lot of enthusiasm for the subject. The exercises help reinforce the material.,4
35853,"Very nice and entertaining courseSometimes the quizzes can be a bit frustrating. They could be set better.Also, often the quizzes are very trivial.",4
35859,"I really appreciate the approach which was taken to present such a delicate topic, but still there are some mistakes which shouldn't had happened. Like the year of Einstein's death according to common known history is not 1995. Also, many times, English subtitles are not correct, I have a feeling that machine has done it. Sometimes there is no understanding of content just the closest word to the sound produced was used. In any case, it is worth of my time, I will recommend it. Students are also provides with plenty of additional materials and when one has more time can study",4
35873,"Very good course. Lot of practical information after first 2-3 weeks. If only the method would have had tiny bit more variation, such as animations, video analysis, case studies, maybe more expert visitors etc. it would have been even better and more durable in long run. But all in all, highly recomended.",4
35874,"I learned many things from this lecture! Not just the information about the history itself, but also how those graphic designer in late era came out with ideas. Their thinking, their purpose, their effect and inspiration to the new designer. Great!",4
35875,Nice and informative,4
35878,This course is very informative and inspiring.,4
35879,"Solid, if minimal introduction to some points from the History of Graphic Design.",4
35886,The course was well structured; and provided opportunity to seek and learn more on the topics dicussed,4
35892,I learnt quite alot about design luminaries. Would prefer if it was truely global but still a very interesting course,4
35905,"I would like to have more materials. See more work, read/listen about more design movements.",4
35914,Great content. There is a lot to learn from this course. Excellent lectures.,4
35916,Useful intro to the history of graphic design. The quizzes could have been more challenging though or involved doing more independent research on some of the graphic design periods discussed.,4
35927,Clear pattern of graphic design history!,4
35939,Good start for learning History of GD.,4
35944,Really interesting and useful. Although some more information about the more post-modern approaches would be also great.,4
35947,"Although this course is rich in content, it lacks a lot of perspective around The History of Graphic Design, since it only talks from the american point of view.",4
35955,"This was a very interesting and informative addition to this specialization. I loved the lecturer's style, and found this to be one of my favourite offerings so far. Very much looking forward to the capstone course and project.",4
35960,it gives a good understanding of graphic design evolution from post second WW to contemporary time. Very focused on American design.,4
35961,Interesting course!,4
35963,Too example based course but indeed very interesting for exploring the ages of graphic design hitory,4
35969,"Excellent presentation, engaging content, interesting and relevant assignments and quizes.",4
35985,"Interesting course, even though it covers only topics relating to investment management within a portfolio and math formulas could be better explained using more concrete examples.But for anyone who has not a finance degree and wants to acquire knowledge in this field, it's definitely worth it!",4
36007,Great course. Very helpful and informative.,4
36012,"Thanks very much Fred! I really liked the content of your course, it really made me aware of how important it is to be a leader in the Health Care Environment, and how important it is to build quality with all the participants, including the patient.",4
36015,"Lovely course. Although I was familiar with many of the discussed topics , it was an insightful course that presented comprehensive information in a professional yet an easy way to understand. Thanks for the university and the professor to provide such course with such quality .",4
36019,"this course is helping me A lot to learn new things about healthcare . like tps etc, i love this course, it helps a lot even in our job in healthcare",4
36030,A very useful course for anyone who has involvement in helping to provide care for the elderly.,4
36048,"The course itself was well designed and presented, however, there was sometimes too much information included in each sentence for someone who was unfamiliar with the topic. I had to watch several of the videos more than twice in order to note down and clarify the information that was presented. Also, some of the quizzes included information that was briefly mentioned in the videos but not clearly elaborated resulting in some confusion when it was time to complete the evaluation.",4
36052,A great course with a very good overview on the international courts and tribunals of the hague and is very helpful to the better understanding of internationals tribunals specially for law students in their first years.,4
36056,The course is rather interesting. However it is worth mentioning that the course is very initial introduction without detailed materials in the topic!,4
36057,This course was very good and i hope to see you in leiden university in summer school. thank you,4
36068,The course is excellent for beginners in international law,4
36069,Interesting course but was expecting something sligtly different.,4
36070,Basic understanding. Recommend to those under graduate students.,4
36072,"Excellent course! I have learnt a lot about international justice tribunals, arbitration and international law. Highly recommended for general knowledge and for law students.",4
36080,Excellent introduction to the International courts system. More details on Investor-State Arbitration or perhaps a course exclusively on the topic would be great!,4
36082,All tribunals and courts in the Hague are mentioned in this course but the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal.,4
36083,A very good short overview!,4
36092,Very interesting and thought provoking course. Well balanced with wonderful references and recommended readings.,4
36093,Amazing course! A great to tool for anyone interested in International Law.I felt i learned a lot. Thanks!,4
36100,A very informative and valuable learning experience. Highly recommended for the global citizen striving to navigate the often complex halls of international power and justice.,4
36106,"I will give it a 4, but 3.5 would be my review if the 3.5 mark would be available.Strenghts of the course: Solid and elegant presentations, good readings, and the interviews presented with the ICJ judge and the PCA secretary added value.Weakeness and Opportunites: No slides, excessivelly short course in video resources (discounting the interviews, it had about 20-40 minutes of videos, what is clearly insuficient, when benchmarking with other offerings in the MOOC 'arena') and allowing quizzes to be taken on a 2x per hour is not in my opinion adequate. It makes it too easy and fast to finish the course and does not create an incentive to review the materials. Leiden should focus in presenting more specializations in the educational fields that it has reputation - Law, Tax Law, International Studies, in order to capture more value from the current lack of offerings of specializations in that niche markets.Threats: There is a lot of offerings on the MOOC space, with a finite time availability to make choices. By having courses that are very short, there is the risk that people become inclined to chose other offerings that offer more video resources and other materials.Besides my opinion - I am a critic by design, thank you for continuing offering courses in this platform.I wish you luck.Ricardo Oliveira",4
36115,Excellent course! However tough to manage all the technical terms if you're a newbie ;),4
36116,"Nice introductory course, would have liked it to be more practical in some aspects, but still great to follow. Recommended!",4
36117,Quite an engaging course from very modest Prof. Bob Schiller. My first on line course and it was a very satisfying experience.,4
36120,"Informative, but a liitle bit boring. Videos are too long, as I think",4
36136,Great introductory course. Builds solid foundations. Should have been longer to cover more topics.,4
36144,"The course gives you an insight of practically almost all the aspects of finance! And that too in just 8 weeks! So kudos to that. Since this course gives a glimpse of almost everything in finance, it becomes easy for a person to choose his/her area of specialization for the future.One of the things that can improve is the subtitles (English). There are just so many errors in them.",4
36151,Great course. Introduction to financial markets and regulations. Professor Shiller es clear and didactic.,4
36157,great course,4
36161,Interesting first-introduction to financial markets,4
36162,Interesting approach.,4
36163,"The course was extremely interesting, it helped me a lot in general about how markets operate, and how they are interlinked within the economy. The course would have been more fruitful if more numerical examples and explanations were given in lectures.",4
36182,It gives an interesting general view of the financial market and the guest lecturers contribute with very interesting views about the professional financial world and the causes to the recent financial crisis. Very good as an overview.,4
36202,It was a great experience studying this course from such a great profession. This course certainly increased my knowledge about financial market which will help me in my future educations. But the only thing to go for this course is that you must know about financial market in advance this course will just help to sharp you education not completely make your basics clear.,4
36204,The course was good and relevant to what the markets are at present. It was easy to grasp for fresher. Would recommend it to my friends who would like to do finance specialization.,4
36207,"First and most important: I'm very grateful and honored by taking the course from Professor Schiller, who is clearly a person of great knowledge and intelligence. Examples from real life and history, which he provides during the lectures and the whole ""context"", so to say, of humanization and democratization of finance - all of it is just great for the introductiory course in financial markets. Guests parts of videos are very important and helpful as well.Second and less important: this course, from coursera (not ""live"") perspective, is rather explicit, but still ""contents page"" of a financial book. Amount of abbreviations, mostly US, are just a waste of time in my opinion. Week, where lecturer talks about option markets is a weak part of the course.Nevertheless, if you are completely new to finance and you have some free time for an additional information about the subject - good course. Any other case - not so good.",4
36210,This was a very informative and great overview of financial markets. I learned a great deal and learned more about the industry and how everything fits together into the financial system.,4
36212,"The calculation is kinda complex because the professor just gave the results. In all, it is detailed and enriched.",4
36220,Really insightful. Especially the first 2 lectures.,4
36226,The course was very basic and there was a lot of things that I expected from Professor Shiller that were not covered very well due to the editing of the original course. But it was great experience to take place in a lecture dictated by a Nobel prize winner like him.,4
36227,"Excellent, charismatic professor and very good guest conferences. Very relevant, great end of course message. Poor editing and test design. Many irrelevant questions. Some questions on topics not included in edited course.",4
36265,"The content is very good, the presentation (bits of lectures put together) something to get used to. Overall informative and ""enjoyable"".",4
36276,"This was a GREAT refresher course for someone who has been out of the financial markets for a while AND/OR someone who wants to get a fundamental understanding of financial markets (Thank you Alexander Hamilton!) and what drove the crash in 2008.I love finance. I graduated with a B.S. in Finance but my career took me down a different path. I was interested in catching up on my degree, learning more about the market crash, and the resulting regulations that came from it.I give it 4 stars because some of the content is a bit old (from 2011) and I found that a few of the test questions were not part of the course content. Outside of this, it was a class well worth taking and obtaining the certificate. I loved the guest speakers, especially Karl Icahn.Thank you coursera for bringing great content to the web. It gives me the opportunity to educate myself outside of my profession as well on my own time.",4
36283,Amazing course by Prof.Robert,4
36298,"This was overall a really interesting course. Robert Shiller is really good at storytelling and giving out intuitions about complex financial problems. The (prestigious) guest speakers also enhanced tremendously the appeal of the mooc. Carl Icahn's interview on its own is worth enrolling for this course. The only drawback I found was that this is a typical ""research university course"" in the sense that most of the material should be tackled outside of the classroom, through Fabozzi's textbook in this case. However nothing stops you from reading it of course...",4
36304,Superb sessions by Shiller. Very informative and worthy.,4
36307,"very helpful course with introduction of fundamentals in financial market, very suitable for students who wanna know things about the industry.",4
36311,"Great introduction to financial markets. Understandably, most examples are relevant to the US economy. Would be fantastic if the concepts were covered deeper with more general examples.",4
36313,Very concise and straight to the point.,4
36316,Sir Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher with best skills & a natural smile on his face. Though online it feels like a direct face to face learning with him.It would be m honor to study & learn further from him.,4
36319,Basic concepts well explained by a great teacher,4
36326,this course is very helpful.,4
36328,"Very well organised and presented. The course would be perfect if the transcript made sense (and it does not because it is full of filler words and incomplete sentences), or if the course had supporting material to read. One of the two.",4
36333,Very thorough. I thought this was very critical information and the tests were formatted around actual lecture material. Thank you.,4
36334,"Pros:Introduced me to new ConceptsInsights into elite guest speaker's mindsCovers most bases on the topics mentionedCons:Unclear explanations in some parts, but Google comes to the rescue hereOverall, highly recommended (especially to economic majors)",4
36340,"It covers all the basics. In addition to it, leading industry personality talks enhances the course content.",4
36345,Perfect course for a newbie in finance and a way forward to go further down the wonderful and challenging coaster in the world of finance.,4
36362,"Great lectures, the tests didn't really focus on the crucial elements of the course in my opinion",4
36364,Excellent business and financial information.,4
36368,"Learned a lot and am glad I completed the course. Prof. Shiller is an engaging lecturer with an enjoyable personality. Wish some subjects were treated in more depth and would have also enjoyed more detailed mathematical treatments. An impressive array of high-profile and influential guest lecturers, but the quality of their lectures varied greatly.",4
36370,Very Comprehensive. It also introduces to Behavioral finance as well! Awesome <3,4
36374,Good and informative.,4
36379,"It is just turning out to be a tremendous experience. Robert Schiller, or Bob Schole (as carl Icaahn calls him) is one heck of a personality! the man holds a sea of depth knowledge and history in him. I'm barely half way through the course but it is just unbelievably informative, and has the right balance of knowledge, explanation, my favorite thing psychology, and the guest speaker every week is the cherry on top!",4
36381,It's really nice course.,4
36386,Very informative and delivered in a simple but effective manner. Lack of case studies and a bit too theoretical are the shortcomings,4
36405,"Excellent course. Robert Shiller is a very accessible and personable lecturer, making you really feel like you are in the lecture theatre.The course material is relevant and delivered in an interesting way. The assessment questions perhaps don't challenge the learners understanding as much as it could.... however never the less a great introduction to Financial Markets and recommended for anyone wanting to dip their toe in to this area or enhance existing knowledge.Many thanks Yale Uni, Prof Shiller and Coursera.",4
36406,"I think the crises happened because of the limits of the debts of the financial institutions and the risk to give employees more loans that they can't pay back which had risk some companies in the wall street and couse more crises on the workers wage, the banks some times feed the rich people on the account of poor, the roof of salaries must be equal to work and the business, the level of planing how to avoid another crises, how to determine the markets finance needs built on the opinions of the citizens and built on the supply and demand. Thanks a lot for the lectureYour sincerelyHossam Al-Dean Al-Barqouni An accountant graduated from Philadelphia university .",4
36411,It's quite clear and interesting explanation with some historical background of the derives. Just sometimes it's a little bit long time to explain a theory instead of an intense explanation due to the sync with a real class.,4
36416,"A very insightful introductory course that introduce us to a broad range of financial instruments, history as well as discussion on some recent crisis.",4
36431,"A very interesting and basic introduction to financial markets that is suitable for anybody. For Coursera, the course has been shortened compared to the original version taught at Yale. In some places, unfortunately, it seems like too much is left out.",4
36434,Pretty good coverage of a variety of financial markets. This is an entry level course for those with basic understanding.,4
36438,"Robert Shiller is a great professor, I'd have love to have him as teacher in real life!Said so, however, the course here on Coursera is missing a lot of important informations, which are fundamental not only to have a better understanding but also to complete successfully the exams.",4
36445,"Shame that some interesting parts have been cut out of the lectures, but a very good overview and insight in financial markets",4
36447,The sound volume is a bit low even turning up to the maximum level,4
36450,"I would recommend this course for those that want to understand the basic workings of financial markets in the US. I especially enjoyed the top notch speakers, and viewed some of their full talks on youtube. Thank you!",4
36472,Course is Brilliant but not for a complete novice or someone who doesnt have enough time to devote to the course. Professor is exceptional. Best of luck to all students .,4
36473,"As Professor Shiller had said, this course is the shortened version of Financial Markets (2011), which he taught in Yale. A shortened one as it is, I benefit a lot from the course. Terms are explained explicitly. Unfortunately, videos in week 3 is not complete, so I had to go to Open Yale for more info. If you want more info, more materials and more homework, you can go for Open Yale. Materials are more detailed there. Despite the inconvenience, I think this course is very suitable for peoples like me, a beginner in finance. I quite recommend this course. A better one if the error can be solved.",4
36486,"I really like professor Bob, and his lecture is great! However, the order of how things were taught is questionable to me. In my opinion, students should learn basic knowledge about finance first, and then go to the topics like diversification. Besides, the quiz were not well designated. I don't see the point to answer a question like ""When was Fannie Mae created?"".",4
36491,"The course is well organized and thorough. However, there are typically a few questions on each week's quiz that is not covered by the lectures. Overall, I'd recommend the course to anyone interested in learning about finance and the marketplace.",4
36496,Professor rambles a little but the basic content is all there.,4
36511,Contents are precise and to the point.,4
36514,"This is an interesting introductory course on finance. I enjoyed Professor Shiller's style of delivery. Some of the quantitative analysis, although limited, appeared to assume some additional knowledge of the subject matter. The video editing could be improved, particularly in the earlier lectures where some of the quiz questions where not covered in the online lectures.",4
36515,I really enjoyed the class . The information was relevant and interesting. I especially liked the guest lecturers.I would recommend this class .,4
36516,The course is overall helpful and knowledgeable. Great teaching bu Prof. Shiller,4
36535,"I would like to give this course 5 stars because Robert Shiller is such amazing teacher and lecturer, but I have to give it 4 stars because as is the lectures are not very well edited. A lot of content was left out, and some of the quizzes test material that is not even in the course.",4
36542,good course. Pay attention during lectures or you will not pass.,4
36546,This is a really nice introductory course. I liked it a lot. The only reason I gave it a 5 star rating is the fact that some lectures are missing.,4
36547,All the Course material is available online on other websites and it is kind of very old,4
36553,It is a general course for non-specialist in finance.,4
36554,"It was a fantastic introductory course for a non finantial profile people who wants to introduce himself in this world.I wish to congratulate professor Shiller, Yale University and Coursera for this course and digital adaption and, obiously, I want to recomend this course to everyone.",4
36558,"Thanks for Professor Robert Shiller's help and Yale University's sharing this course online. Professor Robert Shiller is a charming man, and this course gives a broad overview of how the financial market operates. This course teaches me what the real world is like, much of which I have not learnt in my finance course in my university.I didn't give it five stars because I think the course materials, as well as the quiz and exam, focus too much on ""economic history"". Professor Robert Shiller talks a lot about big events in history, including the time, the people and some other details. While I agree that as an academician, we should respect the great people and great event in history, I think that these details are not so important for beginner of financial markets.To conclude, this course is great and I would recommend this course to those who want to know what the real financial world is like!",4
36564,Awesome project. Well explained,4
36566,"Even though the course is a bit theoretical especially the assignments, it can be decent start for a beginner. I wish the topics weren't so scattered as it was getting difficult for all the knowledge to set in.",4
36571,"Most material cut and pasted from older lectures. Shiller offers strong foundational knowledge and excellent perspectives. Multiple prestigious guest speakers offer a nice change of pace. A little content heavy per week, but quizzes are an easy and fast application of knowledge to progress to the next week.",4
36576,"There appears to be some missing lectures, if you look on the forums other classmates have evidence of that.",4
36578,Its interesting and enables me to gain more insights into topics I didnt fully cover at school....,4
36595,"Could've been more complicated and in-depth, but I suppose for a Coursera lesson it was fine. Kinda felt like a Yale advertisement, more than a finance course. Prof. Schiller was very good, I do enjoy listening to his lectures, interviews and any other material i can get my hands on.",4
36608,"I think this course it's so good, though is slightly hard to undertand, probably because the teaching metodology I think.",4
36612,Great course for advance students. A lot of philosophy but a very few maths about finance.It is not a course for every one.,4
36620,"Very interesting class, but somehow the content slowly shifts from economy to philosophy/sociology from my perspective. It's not a bad thing on my opinion, but the content could have been backed up with more raw facts.An issue with one of the videos (Week 3, third video). Fortunately it can be found on Youtube.Thanks!",4
36630,It's a good course. However it's a little bit superficial.,4
36632,"This course is very informative, it also brings in different guest speaker's point of view of financial market. However, a lot of interest topics were not expanded wide or deep enough.",4
36635,Some videos seem truncated. Cut off and start too abruptly.,4
36638,"A terrific overview of financial markets nearly up to the present. I enjoyed Professor Shiller's insights and enthusiasm for his field and particularly enjoyed his attempts to point out how knowledge of financial markets empowers individuals to help even the economic playing field for individuals throughout our society. The guest speakers added another level of authenticity to the experience.On the negative side, I thought the exams were not optimally designed since specific minute items appeared to be emphasized to the exclusion of more conceptual questions,Overall I think the course is worth the time of anyone interested in finance at any level of complexity.",4
36641,"Great content overall. Some of the lectures are now a bit out of date, but the information is still technically accurate. I'd appreciate a newer version of the lectures, most of which were created in 2011. (The introductory remarks from the professor each week have been updated somewhat).I'd also appreciate the full videos for each lecture. Some of the lecture videos are cut off quite extensively. A video may say it's 5 minutes in length, but the professor's lecture hasn't ended, and students end up wandering whether the lecture has actually ended. In most cases, as my classmates and I have found, the lecture was not posted in full and we have to go to YouTube to get the full lecture.Other than these two smaller issues, the content and lectures are good quality and a reasonable length for each week. I learned a lot from this course that will help me better understand the world of banking and finance in particular.",4
36656,"Great course to learn about financial markets, although it is not challenging. The quizzes will only test how well you remember dates and certain definitions mentioned in the video. If you just want to learn about basics of financial markets then this course is perfect for you. Don't expect any calculations though.",4
36662,"Professor Schiller is truly engaging and clear, the video editing however is definitely not has good and the course material not has carefully put together as some of the other top courses offered on Coursera.",4
36685,"Excellent material! I thought the lectures were very well organized and expertly presented, and my interest was kept up throughout the course. The only thing I would like to see is some more challenging homework/quizzes to help drive home the content. I came in as a financial markets newbie (I'm a computer engineer by trade), and my interest is definitely piqued to learn more. Thanks, Prof. Shiller!",4
36688,"Some of the lectures are missing and some of the questions/answers in the quiz are not the same as given in the lecture. Overall, I'm satisified, athough would prefer lectures to be no longer than 15min per one video",4
36689,starting from scrach an then coming onto its concepts. great learning,4
36690,"Great Course, Great Professor!!!",4
36693,"Very good course for beginners, after completing you have solid basic knowledge of financial world. I expected some more mathematics though.",4
36703,Great course a bit tricky but understandable.,4
36704,An excellent introductory course on finance.Very well designed.,4
36707,a great way to compute rather th,4
36708,Easy to understand,4
36713,Need some extra work in order to get this certification.,4
36719,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,4
36724,"Very interesting course material. However, I do NOT recommend anyone to pay for the specialization.",4
36729,Outstanding course!,4
36730,This course is well explained by Professor. Sometimes i found myself in trouble using R Syntax because i wasn't much familiar with it,4
36736,Course is great with actual coding examples so that students can understand how the actual process happens.,4
36738,Very good for an overview. Would have been excellent with a more in-depth and demanding sequel.,4
36743,Great introduction to the topic. Built on the last course and deepened my R knowledge a lot.,4
36747,Just one more short videos on other methods of Marketing Analytics,4
36748,"I highly recommend this course because of its applicable use of R programming. I had no knowledge of R, but was able to pick it up quickly because the professor made it applicable to real life scenarios. My only negative was that it was too short of a course; I hope the team at ESSEC considers making a intermediate course to continue on with this training.",4
36750,"This course so far is really very useful in my academics and through this course, I am now well-versed with all the marketing strategies used in the industry.I would like to thank the professor for teaching us so well.",4
36751,The course provides good insights in Marketing Analytics and impart introductory knowledge on the subject.,4
36752,I have great learning on this even though I has some experiences on building marketing prediction model. It has refreshed my memory and also I have learned new thing in this course too. Thanks Prof for conducting this course.,4
36753,Received theoretical as well as practical knowledge from the course,4
36774,"Very helpful, to learn the way to communicate in certain level.",4
36777,"This cours it's very interesting, it gives you a lot of very good tips for improve your skills communications, some videos are not excellent in terms of edition but i recommend this course for those who are open to learn about writing effective emails and those who want to learn more business terms.",4
36802,"It is basic, but helpful. If you have an intermediate english and you don´t use it much in your job, you can catch up you english practice with many business terms.It also gives some basic but good tips for developing in a team and as a leader.",4
36804,"Very good course, the videos explain the main topics, providing immediate actions to daily activities.",4
36810,Effective approach to main issues an well explained.It was amazing and got engagement it. Thanks,4
36811,"An excellent course, with wonderful content! Very useful and helpful tips to business situations. Thanks very much to Arizona University!",4
36814,"Actually the course is great but i am not into history, seems that i have memory issues to memorize these tons of information, greetings for all of you guys and hope i would work with my memorizing issue through the rest of the course :). Thanks",4
36825,"The task not matched to the devices in Poland, not every use iPhones.",4
36829,it's very usefull,4
36830,Very interesting historical references and the framing of the IoT story around the convergence of technologies was well received by me.,4
36831,Good background for non-experts but just an introductory course.,4
36833,Excellent introduction to IoT with both high level history and application information and details on communication technology that has enabled the IoT revolution.,4
36834,"Pretty loaded with information on how we got to here technology-wise. Lacks on some more in-deep info, even being a introductory course, it could have a bit more info on the state of the art of IoT.",4
36839,"Initially gets very boring but at the end gives you more information about where to orient yourself, some useful information,",4
36845,NB-IoT is not discussed while getting upto here.,4
36861,Fairly good overview of events and technologies leading up to IoT.,4
36864,Good review of the history.,4
36873,The course is great! My only concern is that the accent of the main speaker makes the course a little bit hard to understand by foreigners.,4
36882,"A very general introduction to the topic. Fair warning: they throws in allot of acronyms, which can be very discouraging to continue with the course.",4
36892,It was helpful to understand IoT but I want to the lecture note would be enhanced.,4
36898,the questions were too easy in my opinion. everything else is fine,4
36899,"Great Course, I hoped it would have gone into a bit more detail, but it was good to get a tour through the history of computer networks.",4
36904,Good Course for Evolution of IoT,4
36912,"This is a great course, highly recommend it, but make sure you have the bandwidth to climb a steep learning curve if you aren't in the investment world.",4
36935,Very useful,4
36936,"It was very good, I could have a good understanding about the course.",4
36937,It was great! A great start.,4
36941,Javascript course content can be increased,4
36944,The course is very informative. The topics discussed are precise and the tutor was very nice to help us understand the concepts easily.,4
36946,"While not very in depth regarding HTML and CSS, this course gives a nice skim over the HTML and CSS aspects. Regarding JavaScript, this course is the best introduction I've done so far. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to fill in gaps in their base knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript",4
36954,A good course for a beginner level.,4
36956,"Just got my certificate today, One of the best course out there to start from basic. little bit fast hence have to read lots of resources from other media like W3school.com. other then that its the best course to start with in web development.",4
36960,the courses are well structured,4
36961,"The course is very instructive but the student should be prepared to do some considerable research on their own as well! The assignments can be challenging for beginners but, if you get through them, you'll have learned a lot!",4
36965,Course is pretty good for Learning,4
36969,Good coursework,4
36978,"It was good. The professor teaches well, but I think course went a little bit fast. Also I had some issues with audio. Above all, it was good.",4
36990,"Although not in deep, this course provides the basics for learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS in a confortable way. Teacher David Rossiter is great explaining the basics and also the language is easy to understand even for those not very used to eanglish language.",4
36993,"Very interesting for beginners. Is very hands on focus, not much theory and is focus on the most used commands, leaving the deep knowledge for other courses.",4
36998,"I feel this course offers great exposure to the basics of the fundamental web development technologies- HTML, CSS and JS. It sets solid foundation and generates enthusiasm in learner's mind to explore more further.",4
37000,"I would say it was very quick over-viewed and extremely informative course! However, I would recommend not to stop on this and look up for more on HTML, CSS and JS.",4
37004,"It's a great course to know the basic thing in HTML,CSS and JS",4
37013,"The course is excellently taught by David and I learned a lot. Worth doing as a pre-cursor to any other, longer web design course you might be considering as it gives you the basics. My advice would be to take time with the lectures, download a html text editor and pause frequently to check the code yourself and make sure it works. It moves quickly, but there's a lot to be learned from pausing and trying it yourself.",4
37023,Articlute and engaging instructor. nice and easy introduction for assignments. Awesome course!,4
37026,"content is good, lectures can be more user friendly",4
37038,"basically for javascript, you could dig more. this more like a after class practice. other than that it is well organized, with detailed materials",4
37047,Very good. Experience in any programming language is required for anyone who knows nothing about programming.,4
37060,I would have preferred if the tutor always showed some real life example on how to use the learning in creating an online shop for instance.,4
37064,Useful for all web developers...,4
37074,I would have liked the course to have more step by step lectures that would allow us to follow the same structure when going through our assignments. Maybe even explain the assignment in the start then apply each lecture to show how each step is done within the assignment. I had to resort to third party sites and found that alot of the assignments have been uploaded online already.,4
37080,It's pretty good course. Although I have not completed this course yet.,4
37094,Very good course for understanding web-development,4
37103,"That's a good course for HTML, CSS and JS beginers!",4
37104,"The course assignments are challenging enough to make you move and self teach the concepts, although I found lack of feedback from course curators. I learned mostly reviewing other students work. In general I'm happy with what I learned.",4
37108,I was expecting harder course with more content but this course for absolute beginners to web so I guess I can't say much bad about course only that I would like if it had more content and harder projects.,4
37111,Good Experience,4
37141,This course is great.,4
37157,"The course was well developed. Good introduction. Would like to have seen a little more with Classes and creating simple components with Prototype, just to give everyone the basic knowledge of how to encapsulate code.",4
37163,"Good for a beginner and useful as a refresh for someone who already knows html, css and js basics.",4
37166,"Very good introductive course, I enjoyed doing the exercices and the assignments!",4
37177,Very good course.,4
37181,This Was An Awesome Introduction To HTML CSS JAVASCRIPTLoved It So Much,4
37182,"The course met my expectations. The exercises were relevant to the discussions and the level of depth made it easy to follow. A fine course to introduce oneself to HTML, CSS, and Javascript basics.",4
37185,I learned a lot,4
37186,I like it! Brief but complete introduction to website World!,4
37188,Courses can be a bit more detailed.,4
37191,A very good course. The good thing about it is the way it is organized.,4
37199,nice and simple for beginners,4
37217,"A great class for anyone interested in learning the essentials of html, css, and javascript in relatively short order.",4
37218,It's awesome! But It is very very general!,4
37219,Good way to get hands on experience. While it is challenging to get a quesiton answer - as there is a lot of searching on the forums (rather than having 1-1 or life q&a),4
37222,"It seems quite slow pace at the beginning, but I love the fact that there are no assumptions on knowledge and a lot of small details are being explained. These details are very important, specially when you take this course as an advance c++ programmer. Understanding the advantages that Javascript has built-in as a languague is really useful! Thank you!",4
37228,"Very nice and the presentations are very clear and understandable,It's a very basic course of web development which is why I think it's a little bit expensive for this level of course.",4
37230,Really clear but it's a pity that there is nowhere a free possibility to gain certificates... :(,4
37235,Really good course on HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. Enough resources and practices exercises.,4
37236,Very good intro class. The exercises were really helpful.,4
37238,"HTML and CSS parts of the course are not the best, but the JavaScript part is the best you can find on vanilla JavaScript on Coursera.",4
37243,It is a good course. Just need more hands on training to practice exercises,4
37252,Very Straight forward and explicit.,4
37255,i have great learning form this course and i love to learn more and more form Coursera,4
37256,"The course is good, although the last exercise of the series is a bit too challenging if you want people that have just started with javascript to pass. Also, sometimes it focuses too much on theory and high level examples that don't build up into practical uses of javascript.",4
37257,It Was very successful to me,4
37275,"This course helps in understanding the basic and overall concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScripts",4
37283,It is too easy.,4
37286,this is the second week being finished and I am so happy to follow this course it is really great.,4
37287,It's a little bit too easy.,4
37299,"Straightforward, simple, and very useful as an introductory course.",4
37308,"The content was too basic, but good",4
37319,"Well taught course but the material for the homework assignments were basically given to us. The answers were handed to us in the homework description. Having said this, the assignments were good. One should have basic program",4
37328,Very clear. But the project is not very difficult.,4
37334,"Gives a great overview, though a bit more depth and content would have been great. Still, overall a great course for beginners!",4
37336,"The courses are great. I enjoyed them a lot. I have one comment on the JavaScript topics though. Key concepts like JavaScript objects, closures, module pattern and Immediately Invoked Functions are not covered. I understand that JavaScript is a very broad subject but a quick review of those key points would be great for a student to continue reading further on its own.",4
37337,Gives you a strong basics.,4
37345,"I appreciate the way in which the whole knowledge was presented – as simple as possible, in easy to understand English words. But I would prefer it if the course was divided into 4 weeks.",4
37353,Good to learn the basics of web development,4
37363,Good exposure and practice.,4
37366,"The instruction was clear and simple. The one topic I'm still having trouble with is the way Divs are positioned. The concepts around floating left and right make sense, but, when I put it into practice, I was not getting the same results as I was expecting. I would love to see a follow up video on this topic to make this concept simpler for me to understand.",4
37368,it was good course learned alot,4
37369,Enjoyed it.,4
37371,The course was well put together. The assignments are broad enough to cover everything you learnt in the tutorials.,4
37380,"Good introduction course. Assignments could be bit harder, or maybe not so much guided.",4
37382,"Looks good, but the assignment a bit simple.",4
37383,It's not that difficult and challenging i though of.,4
37384,This course will just give overview and will be easy for only those who have some prior knowledge in programming.Anyone new to programming will have a hard time to get everything.Anyways it was atleast very helpful for me.,4
37385,"This course is a good introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The lectures were straightforward, and the assignments were good exercises of the lecture material.I gave it 4 stars, only because the task of learning HTML and CSS is a bit dry and boring. No fault of the instructor.",4
37393,Good basic foundation of HTML and CSS.It will help if the grading rubric needs to be more flexible in order to assess smaller outcomes. I found it too binary to be of use for accurate assessment.,4
37395,Good beginner course. I would've liked more assignments to really drive the points home. And maybe a bit less hand holding in the assignments,4
37415,"Clean, well-built videos, course. Though one must pay for submission.",4
37428,i really love the way tutor has explained things in detail. its makes easy to understand and implement .,4
37434,very good BUT no discussion on objects which is very important,4
37436,"Great! Some key information was omitted assuming student knew some key concepts, I had to cross reference on the internet to back fill. Otherwise good.",4
37439,Great course helped me understand the basics very well. I wish responsive techniques and chrome developers tools were talked about a bit.,4
37440,"A good introductory course, perfect for beginners.",4
37445,Could have been used more practical approach and more advanced stuff.,4
37446,Learned a lot from the course. Really beneficial. Loses a star due to having to mark other people's work - really time consuming!,4
37451,Good assignments,4
37454,"Good, but would be better with more examples and exercises of more key aspects.",4
37457,"if it was free course, it will nicer :)",4
37459,"This course has given me a general approach should be used as javascript, and helped me implement solutions without the need for utilzar framewors javascript.",4
37463,"Professor is really goooood! He explains the material from the slides, just as if you were in an actual class, i.e. he doesn't read from some screen. Assignments are challenging but easy at the same time because you submit the full versions in incremental steps. Good learning experience. However, I feel the course is a bit expensive for a three week period.",4
37466,"Well done. Focuses mainly on videos to teach the content with an assignment at the end of the week that uses everything you learned. I would rate 5 stars if it had more quizzes or exercises to do before the week's assignment. At any rate you learn a lot about Html, css, and JS and it's a worthy class in this specialization.",4
37478,"Great course for ""brushing up"" on basic web design, but doesn't really provide any more information than what W3Schools already has on their site. Don't expect a deep dive into JS -- it's just enough to give you some ideas on how to manipulate elements within your website.",4
37481,Good overview of HTML/CSS/Javascript. Nice audio/video quality and preparation. Fun homework assignments and examples.Would have liked more CSS touches.,4
37495,Videos are simple and easy to understand.,4
37497,I love this course it is very useful for me.Thanks for this course.,4
37498,The professor really needs to make the course more exciting - you don't need to be educated to know enthusiasm promotes content reception.,4
37510,It was a good course. It is hard to make it useful and interesting for everyone since students will have varying degrees of knowledge coming in. I know that I learned a lot that I can apply in my work.,4
37523,This a great beginners Course.Each concept is explained clearly and precisely.,4
37529,"This course was very nice. It was kind of a bit basic, but that's what I've expected of a beginner course which is covering basic and the most important factors of web technologies. The reason I give 4 stars is that everything is too much served on the plate. Assignments are prepared really, really well, which kind of loses the point. You almost don't need to think about anything to finish the assignment. Overall, awesome course!",4
37531,"Nice course, although it could be even better if it lasted for 4 weeks, where the last week would cover pure javascript in much more depth.",4
37537,"Good teacher, simple learning, maybe too basic, mostly with CSS",4
37538,One week shorter than other similar courses but the eLearning lectures are of excellent quality and the assignments do stretch you to learn,4
37542,"Very fun and useful course! Would have rated 5 stars if it provided a little more in depth technical information and options as a kind of ""free to dive in"" addition to the course material.",4
37548,Good one for the Beginners.,4
37557,"Excellent work, gives all basic knowledge to a new comer to web development and HTML/CSS basics. Needs more practical examples if possible.",4
37560,I want more practice,4
37566,Really covers the basics,4
37582,"good course, but not free to access the tasks. have to pay to fulfill it.",4
37583,"Maybe quite basic, but useful on the certification path",4
37588,3rd project can be made little more simpler !!! for begineer its really difficult .,4
37589,"Covers almost everything for a fine understand of html, css and plain javascript",4
37592,"In my opinion this course is too simple for anyone who have a bit of programming experience. On other hand, it is a base course and it is excellent for any other person with no experience.",4
37594,"Excellent course, the only thing that prevented me from giving 5-starts is that it would be extremely helpful if we received feedback from the host school. Given the nature of Coursera, I know this is unfeasible, but it would still be nice. Otherwise, it's ""the blind leading the bind"" scenario. Given all that, I'd still recommend this course to anyone without reservation.",4
37602,"Not very good explain javascript. After this course I had many questions about this language, I not understood it enough.",4
37607,i have finished this course and it is a good introduction to HTML CSS and JS.,4
37610,Good one. Going from Basics to little bit advance. Nice assignments and Quiz added in course.,4
37615,Was good enough for one has prior knowledge.,4
37619,Awesome material,4
37623,I managed to learn things I didn't knew before. Althought thinking upfront that I have that knowledge already. Thank you!,4
37624,Learnt alot but it needs more examples to help with the projects -note i am a total beginner and i think the time needed to study for me is 3x that was is stated.,4
37630,Great professor!This is first course that kept my attention until the end.Only thing that would make this course better is to help us a little bit less in our projects.,4
37635,Very good exercises,4
37637,very nice presentation and content for beginners,4
37638,great course,4
37640,A bit too simple for my liking. And too many repeated content. But overall a good course for an absolute beginner.,4
37642,"Some prior knowledge is assumed, but the course does cover everything, although the basics are glanced over very quickly.HTML and Javascript coverage was excellent, but I felt that a little more time could have been spent on more complex CSS.",4
37650,"Overall, I found the course to be an excellent refresher and, in some ways, an expander of my existing HTML, CSS and JS knowledge. The only suggestion I would offer is to explain how and why the particular information is useful. Examples can cement an abstract concept.",4
37651,"Pretty good basic overview of HTML, CSS and Javascript.",4
37653,Good one! Nice professor :),4
37655,It was a nice course although I'd have appreciated more if it could have been more in depth with CSS...,4
37657,Teacher was very good.,4
37670,A great course to start of Web Development!,4
37690,Very well presented and informative. Some of the early assignments are hard to grade if the person makes a small mistake and the only possible marks are 0% and 100%.,4
37697,"Learning new skill through succinct teaching was a wonderful experience.The course covered good details of the programming languages, but personally I think it was not in-dept learning. I think more learning material along with advanced assignments should be provided for more vivid learners.Overall, it was a course worth taking for me.-Bhushan",4
37706,Good course to teach you the basics :),4
37712,"I wish the javaScript lesson had more examples, specially for the material at the end of the lesson (functions returning functions, etc.)",4
37717,Nice introduction!,4
37735,An interesting course to introduce the basic concepts of HTML. I had a background about HTML however I learned new things.,4
37744,Overall a good course!,4
37750,"This course is very effective to build up the basic foundation of HTML,CSS and JS.",4
37752,"Good well delivered course. Sometimes the instruction is a little repetitive, but that may be a good thing for beginners. The instructions can also sometimes be a bit vague, overall a good course though.",4
37759,"This is a pretty good course for learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already had some experience with these three languages, so consider that when reading this review. I found that the amount of information they cram into this three week course was pretty substantial, which I think is a positive aspect of the course. They don't just teach you what you need to complete the exercises, they teach you a lot of things that even more experienced users of this language may have forgotten. That being said, I don't think the amount of information covered is realistically anyone could retain in three weeks. I would instead see this course as a crash course as to what features are available with these three languages, then save the course slides as sort of a reference for when you go off on your own. My favorite part of this course is that the exercises are unique and fun. The HTML assignment is sort of boring, but that's because HTML is boring, but the exercises that use javascript are a lot of fun. To conclude, I think this course would be great for brand new web developers and also for people who just need a refresher. Good luck!",4
37764,Course is good as an introduction. explanation of various other important properties in CSS to build a web page with different layouts could have been an added advantage. Though the course has given me a good understanding.,4
37768,Excellent very good introduction especially recommended javascript,4
37772,"Its ok and I liked the exercises, but I think you see to many themes and there is almost no practice for them. Its hard to learn them.",4
37783,"Javascript & HTML are covered nicely for a 3 week course & enables us to learn anything new from the web on our own.The course lacks in the coverage of CSS (Hence the 4 stars & not 5).The final project was very nice & interesting, so much so that I have been developing it further & have added many more features to it.",4
37810,It is a very well planned and structured course! I think it gives you a starting point to know all the web development core.,4
37815,"Great for beginners, the basics are well explained.",4
37817,I am satisfied with the course content. It gave me a great opportunity to learn programs and also a great step forward in web programming.,4
37830,"Very Good Indeed!Instructor goes thru quite a number of HTML, CSS and JavaScript examples.A good starting point.",4
37833,A very good course and covers a wide range of topics especially in JavaScript.,4
37834,"This is a great course overall, but it might be a bit hard to follow for those who have no prior programming experience.",4
37852,"I enjoyed the course to review my CSS/HTML skills and get started on JavaScript. I would recommend this course if you have some preliminary experience. If you are completely new to these materials it might be worth doing an introductory course first, as this course is fast-paced and for a beginners many details might be missing.",4
37853,awesome course. like d way prof david taught,4
37870,very good course but it is kinda fast for new people,4
37876,"It covers a lot in a short time, definitely helped me gain some more knowledge.",4
37879,It's quite too simple even with no previous knowledge,4
37880,"The course is well designed and well presented. I wished for a bit more material on CSS and JavaScript. Perhaps, due to time constraints, there could be a separate course for looking at CSS and JavaScript at a more in-depth level.",4
37881,It the One of the Best course in HTML CSS and JavaScriptExcise is fun and the assignment is totally challenging.I recommend this course.Just go for it.,4
37888,Good for begineers...,4
37896,a good start to learn web design from this course.,4
37898,Pretty straightforward but explores many web design concepts.,4
37921,nice course for begginers,4
37923,Very interesting introductory course.,4
37924,"This was a pretty nice course about html css and javascript. Small drawback, the html part did not focus on any of the newly introduced semantic tags and did rather use anonymous divs and spans.Although this may still work it is already pretty bad style therefore I had wished that for people just starting with html5 the course would try to teach them the language using the latest introduced standard.",4
37931,"Content is good but can include more advanced topics in Javascript like various patterns eg IIFE, Module etc. Also, I reckon there should have been some material on Javascript classes,objects etc. As a whole this tutorial is excellent but could have been even better wit above topics included in detail.",4
37948,"I'm not giving the fifth star just because there is only one flaw: not enough interaction between the teacher/TAs and the students. In fact, I never saw the staff participating in the discussions.",4
37951,Good introduction to the base of web developpment,4
37954,Good introductory course to some essential components of Web Development!,4
37957,Great overview and introduction to the fundamentals in web development,4
37962,"It's a very good course to start learning HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. To get the experties suggested material is useful.",4
37964,Really enjoyed the course.,4
37970,Its pretty basic but it is a good start for the entire specialization.Thank you,4
37971,Good course but I think it needs more Javascript materials.,4
37973,"This course provides load of information to get beginners started. The course content and assignments are also challenging enough for me understand the concepts. However the videos are a bit long so it's easy to get distracted. I'd recommend who take this course to take a glimpse at the assignment first, then come back and watch the videos, you'll have better focus on what you want to learn from there.",4
37976,"These exercises are not difficult, even a little easy.",4
37980,"This was a good introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I recommend taking it simultaneously with another beginning course on the same material though because not all aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be addressed in a single course.",4
37983,"Cool, very complete introduction",4
37993,Short but nice introduction!,4
37999,Great course,4
38002,A great course for beginners but there was too much detail for submitting assignments.,4
38006,Good overview of all three core web technologies. The price seems a bit high though if you're considering the verified certificate.,4
38018,"Really liked it, Professor Rossiter was very thorough at explaining the content. Would recommend if I was starting to learn Web design/development.",4
38023,Good course! Thanks!,4
38034,This is a magnificent introduction,4
38036,Great Basics and hands on assignments to get to know a bit about html and css and play around with javascript,4
38043,"Excellent to get a general knowledge of the three technologies. Would have been ideal to allocate two more weeks to expand the lessons related to HTML+CSS and the lessons on JavaScript.Kudos for David Rossiter. Clear, eloquent and helpful.",4
38044,"An excellent course to start. If you know something about web development is not enough for you, but you want to start from scratch this is definitely your course.",4
38045,I loved this course. The only thing that could have made this better was more days for the deadlines.,4
38046,"Basic and easy HTML, CSS and Javascript course. More specializated on Javascript than the other two.",4
38048,"Good course, with useful examples and methodology!",4
38054,I like the course,4
38061,"This course helped expand on my JavaScript knowledge, particularly concerning DOM structure. However, if I had been a beginner in any of these topics, I'm not sure if this course would have been enough. Not much time is spent on clarifying HTML and CSS, i.e., there were a lot of topics untouched. Additionally, while the instructor's videos were excellent, the professor did not participate in course discussions at all. I think there were many times when he should have been available to lend a helping/clarifying hand.",4
38065,Good introduction with practice.,4
38067,good for start,4
38077,"this course was good for me.prior to this course i have no idea of html,css,javascript.explanation was good..",4
38079,"I am totally new in this new HTML language, CSS and Java Script. I like the quality of the information provided in the videos. For a new student like me this is really useful but still, I am not able to cope with the speed of the course. But still, the information is good and I am going to continue until the end. Thanks!",4
38081,"Exercises could have been tougher so that we could reinforce learning material and also try to learn how to search the web to find the solution to a bug.Before a month, all I knew was Javascript was tough.Thanks for making me feel confident programming in Javascript.Thank You.",4
38083,a good intro course for people don't have experience on these topics.,4
38090,"Great set of lessons, covers the specifics and important main things of each of the topics.But I must say that several time the evaluation is a little too hard given the content of the course (talking about quis and projects) and that also is a lot of ground to cover.",4
38094,very good material for beginners,4
38103,It's so good!,4
38112,Well explained course and good for the beginners.,4
38118,Simple and clear!,4
38119,"Some of the videos are a bit too slow phased, but all in all it is a really good introductory course to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Would like to see a part two for each subject with some more in dept coverage of the subjects.",4
38124,Nice introduction to the subject. Teacher and presentations were easy to understand and not too dry. Homework assignments were interesting and peer reviewing other people's submissions helped get pointers on what I could've done better.,4
38126,"This is a very good introductive course. It's easy to follow, it's explicative and offers extra resources to complement the contents and deep.",4
38127,"Basic web course and very well detailed. I could review basic concepts of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to continue in the specialisation series.",4
38136,amazing course for beginners with a little bit of common sense.,4
38140,Very good basic explanation. Expecting some more in-depth hard topics to be covered.,4
38145,a well organized and paced course.,4
38151,"Plus: Lots of information for a beginner course, covers a lot of ground in HTML/CSS/JS. Some applications requiring building web-pages and JS programs to get hands-on experienceNegative: HTML/CSS and to a less extent JS introduced pretty much as a list of disconnected tags/attributes etc, leaves some confusion as to how it all fits together, but that probably can't be avoided when covering a lot of ground in a short 3 weeks beginner course",4
38152,"Nice basics and intro into javascript, css and HTML5",4
38169,The grading is kinda problematic because you can just grade with 1 or 0 nothing in between. Also for the assignments it is hard sometimes to figure out how to solve the problems and external materials are needed.The professor is really good though and so are the lectures!!!!,4
38171,A good basic introduction to the subjects and interesting practical assignments.,4
38177,Good course,4
38178,Excellent course but it moves very fast! Stay caught up with the work and you will do good!,4
38180,"Pros:A basic introduction to the 3 core front-end technologies. The Professor has structured the course in a logical and easy to follow progressive format. The presentations are professionally done with quality audio and HD video. (The Professor speaks with a clear proper British accent). If watching online, there are helpful short quizzes built into the videos to make sure people are not skipping ahead. (Not sure if these 'video quizzes are graded, but I think they are helpful)Cons:The projects are helpful to reinforce logic and programming concepts, however, they are not real world and may be too simple to be of real value. One will need supplemental resources to fill in the gaps for the projects. I would have liked a real world example, even if it was beyond the scope of the course.",4
38183,It could ask more of the student. The assigments was read and do.,4
38187,"Great explanation showing a lot of details, the assignments were very well explained and helped a lot in learning.If the videos were shorter in time it would be better.",4
38190,"Really great lectures. The assignments are also complicated enough that you put in practice what you learned, but not so that you are frustrated with them.",4
38194,"Good Videos, Very helpful, easy to understand. Great value course.",4
38195,A good level of detail for newcomers to web technologies. The assignments are good but I would say too easy in that most of the work in figuring out what to do is actually done for you in the outline of what to submit.,4
38208,Very good explanation.,4
38209,"<p>Pretty clear demonstration, but everything taught here is too simple.</p>",4
38210,Helpful also for experienced HTML students,4
38214,"I like this approach. It gives you the hunger for more JavaScript after you have completed the course. Very good intro course, it covered a lot.",4
38215,"Is excellent, however I hoped to learn more.",4
38217,I really liked how concisely and precisely the concepts were introduced in this course.,4
38219,"I learned a lot from the course and I had fun doing the projects. Although, the projects could be tougher and more involved.",4
38225,It´s ideal for beginners. The teacher explain every thing very clear.,4
38228,Material is great while separating assignment to several parts in confusing for me personally - I don't see why we need first parts when the resulting project contains all from the previous parts. This separation is justified in my mind for big projects - and these assignments weren't that big.,4
38237,"Hi,I got promoted as a beta tester only 4 days ago, which was too short to review the whole course. So, here's my review for the first two weeks.The course is nice and easy to follow. It looks like beginner level. However, since it seems aimed at beginners, I think the teacher should put more emphasis on- good practices (i.e. when there are several ways to do something, always indicate which one is recommended).- accessibility for people with disabilities, which should be a priority when creating new websiteAlso, I think that 3 weeks is a bit too short. The first week should at least be split in two so that students get more time to practice HTML/CSS coding.Lastly, there should be many more practice quizzes and (why not?) optional projects.Thank you for having me as a beta tester.",4
38238,"I have learned a lot, the only thing I would say is that if you realy want to do it correctly and try to get as much as possible from the Course, you have to spend much more time working on it!!!",4
38243,"Good course/ certification program. You get a solid sense of the basics in programming Raspberry PIs, Arduinos and how to plan the build out of a device. My only issue is with the forums and the lack of feedback/ response from the course.",4
38245,I think we should provide more time for the folks to make their project and put up the video. Else it is a great one.,4
38248,"Review of system requirements and specification, project optional. Would have been better with examples/templates and a discussion on writing well formed and lessons learned. As the discussion forums are disabled - that interaction became a lost opportunity..",4
38251,The course is well organized with enough reading materials.,4
38269,Contents where we are referring to the statistics of 2012 should be updated.,4
38270,Meat we need more meat. Where is the beef?Recommendation: One question what should a medium to small business do after a IoT hack? Walk this through as an exercise. This question can be part of a whole program exercise.,4
38272,"Good course. Not many videos to watch, but a lot of papers to read. I think though the selection of them is very good and make you understand the concepts and the challenges of IoT. If you don't mind to read a lot, it is a very good course.",4
38273,Very informative and the information presented is much stuctured.,4
38274,"Grate Course, this lectures are very interesting and importan for understand the IoT World",4
38276,"I really enjoyed this course and enjoy this subject in general. My only complaint is the audio quality for the videos are worse than any other class I've taken. The intro/out is very loud then the speakers are barely audible which became frustrating. That aside, it is a great course.",4
38280,Very informative and relat,4
38282,This was an excellent course. I could go at my pace. I loved that I was in the comfort of my environment so I could pause a,4
38284,Fantastic basic overview course with important content for those in the healthcare arena!,4
38288,"Well done. Excellent quizzes and reading and recordings. There were some sound quality issues. NOt all recordings were of same quality.. SOme , esp in first few videos were hard to hear and had some noi",4
38289,Very enjoyable and easy to follow course. This course is a nice complement to my daily work. Thank you.,4
38291,Great info,4
38292,"Good content from a high level. Would like to see more information from the clinicians point of view. For example, what are they doing in the system as a pa",4
38296,Great! But I miss the interaction with the teacher.,4
38297,Nice course for creating Mario like games,4
38300,"Overall good course. Videos need to be recorded in HD, and some of the later videos need to be re-recorded. The audio feedback is not good and makes it distracting and difficult to watch.",4
38302,"Touches lightly on multi-platform development issues. Further insight into scripting with the Unity Engine. Some very useful character animation and programming in this course. It was fun to put together your own version of the final game. I added some features to the character and AI behavior and created some music for the background. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little more in-depth on dealing with issues with developing for different platforms. It barely skims the surface there. I understand with Unity, several traditional cross-platform issues are resolved by simply targeting the desired platform and letting Unity handle building, but there are still topics worth considering if you are building your own engine or working with one that doesn't build for SDKs; such as limitations on one platform vs another, scaling, LOD, generic interfaces, etc.",4
38309,Like the first course of the Game Design and Development specialization. Brian Win teaches nice concept and then let us go in implementation right away. You will learn a lot of Unity stuff addition to the first course.,4
38319,"This is a really cool course, easy to follow and understand. I'm enjoying it.",4
38324,good course and good teaching. But the problem is when explaining about unity software the letter are so small in tutorial to follow,4
38327,It´s complete and very helpful to get you going and familiarized with the Unity editor.,4
38336,"This course is a sort of sequel to ""Introduction to Game Design"", by providing a deeper learning about the usage of the Unity Engine for Game Development. In the course, the student will develop a game mostly from scratch, using the assets provided by the teachers. There is a stronger focus on coding this time, as well as, a demand for the development of new and original concepts at the end of it.",4
38344,"Learning through example = learning. Much better than the ""design"" course, which I thought could have benefited from ""decomposing"" games into their various mechanics... a sort of reverse engineering or in this case ""reverse design"" Still, the course was plagued by bugs, not so much by its own fault but more due to various updates to Unity and bugs in those updates.",4
38345,Course was awesome but shadder's programming was missing,4
38349,I miss some deep explanation to performance improvement,4
38356,This course was really good from the information available and the follow along for the course. The biggest issues I had were that Unity had issues between the different releases for the various platforms. The import of the assets on Windows 10 required some extra lifting that was not covered by the videos. And the teachers were not very present on the message board. Which seems to be an ever-present problem in this Specialization.,4
38358,"I feel it very similar to the first course. Yes, you make a bigger game, it's more complex, we review more script stuff, and the project is more challenging. However, I feel that it's mainly about joining the pieces together, and following the instructions from the videos.I would like to see more exercises where there is the need to do stuff by yourself. Example: add the code to Sparty script to enable double jump. Then, after we complete the assignment, show us the correct result, so that we also practice scripting, and do the rest of the course with the right script.Also, I think it would be good to add a small course related to the artist's work, just as there is for the designer (Principles of Game Design) and the programmer (this course), but that's outside of the scope of this review.",4
38363,"I am in the middle of the course and will continue till the end.The course does show an easy way how to develop a platformer with Unity3D. It covers a lot of subjects, although I have a feeling that I will need to read about Unity again later.Anyhow, it is too fast and the instructor does not really emphasize on important points. Sometimes he also fails to provide proper explanation of some important parameters.Also, the course is tutorial-oriented but it goes so fast I could not really follow the instructions. So, I ended up watching the classes through and do the tutorial later. But as I said, because the instructions are super-quick, I had to watch them again many times while trying to do the workshop.Maybe this is how it should be but I still feel that it could be a little slower and let be breath a little while trying to digest the content so that I can redo the work by my own after finishing the class.",4
38368,"It was a great course. I love the professor's explanations and it was quite well organized. It would be good to have a document with all the links to songs and albums on Youtube or whatever, so you don't have to manually search for each track.",4
38374,Well done. Lot of material covered. I enjoyed it.,4
38379,Good overview of the birth of Rock,4
38385,Could be improved using musical videos or complementary material. Is a little be boring just listening to lectures. :(,4
38401,It's a great course and so is the book that accompanies it. However the Course and Book titles are not entirely accurate. It should be called 'An American History of Rock'. There is relatively little discussion outside of America and this is only to serve the discussion of American rock.The book in particular would benefit from a section at the end of each chapter or sidebars 'Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic'. As music becomes more fragmented in the 70s I imagine this criticism will become more important.Another thought would be if the Course put a play list together in 'Deezer' and 'Spotify'. That would definitely 5-star the courseStill it's a great course and I really enjoyed it.,4
38408,"Thank you for the course. It's really interesting! I enjoy it so much, especially the quizzes :)",4
38414,"Excellent general course about the history of Rock in the Western World. Lots of names of musicians, companies, and music make the course seem to revolve around memorization. Even so, the professor does describe the historical element in logical chains of events and biographies.The quizzes could have been offered every week. There's no need to clump the quiz material.",4
38425,"Really enjoying this course (nearly done).The subject is perfect for my age (about 50) as I grew on much of this music and play guitar.Wish there was a way to incorporate the music.I am pausing, going to youtube and back constantly but it is worth it.",4
38435,Instructor is very articulate. The layouts for all of the lessons are very simple and easy to maneuver.,4
38437,"Good course, but I was disappointed that clips of some of the music weren't played.",4
38450,"This is a great course that is very informative. It brought many performers to my attention that I had not heard of before or that I had not appreciated before and has enriched my appreciation of music. The course focuses mainly on the history and development of rock music, rather than the technical side of the music itself. It is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music, but does not feature the music itself. I suggest that you keep a streaming service, such as Spotify or Deezer, open in a separate window on your browser, so you can pause the lectures and listen to the music as you go along.",4
38460,It is a very good course for beginners. Great platform to learn this new technology.,4
38461,Very Informative on the basics,4
38466,It was ok. Not that great because the practical/lab exercise should have been more in-depth.,4
38469,"good format, more focus on labs vs. silly company acronyms and nomenclature.",4
38474,Very imformative,4
38490,Very basic course.,4
38495,there are a couple misptints,4
38497,Very little covered on Machine Learning,4
38504,Video is sometimes ineffective,4
38506,"Everything was great about the course, I just would change the teacher's voice, sounds like a robot.",4
38510,Educational and great open excercises,4
38514,"Very good course. Got a lot of useful insights. Quizzes are fine and just right amount but, more challenging lab practices could be helpful.",4
38518,A great concise course which covers the fundamentals.,4
38520,Some of the codelabs need updating!,4
38525,"Excellent materials, focused delivery. Just one suggestion - add more questions to some of the topics.",4
38526,Good videos with Demo.,4
38528,It was really a nice course.! This course clear many of my doubts about GCP and networkings within GCP.,4
38530,A basic course design for individuals who want to learn GCP.,4
38535,"Great course, I really enjoyed it. It gave a good overview of services offered by the GCP. I wish the content were more up to date though.",4
38545,Great introductory Course.,4
38549,When the quizzes are reviewed the answers for True False questions should be explained both why the answer was true and why it wasn't false.,4
38553,Very clear and hands-on course. Thank you.,4
38557,Overall it was a great overview.. Looking forward to seeing upcoming courses.,4
38565,Good overview of GCP. Doug does a great job (if a little dry) but a great course well delivered.,4
38568,Nice course and good study materials,4
38572,Good introduction to what can be done with Google Cloud Platform,4
38573,"The content of the slides were sufficient for the basic intent of this offering. The overview and reasoning behind why the products are competitive for other contending services was clear. When performing the labs, the content is very recipe driven. While that works well for someone attempting to get the work done, there needs to be some visuals prepared that show how the GCP components are laid out and the relationship they have to each other ( simple architecture views ). The GCP products have very similar sounding names, so paragraphs describing what is happening have less effect, whereas some simple architecture views of what the lab is intending to do to go with that in the lab content itself, might help.",4
38576,A good initiative,4
38588,Excellent flow.. starts alittle slow.. but good pace in the middle and end.,4
38594,Would love to see more real-life examples to accompany the theory explained so it really sticks.,4
38597,Its an awesome course and really teaches some cool stuff!,4
38601,Good hands on course. The self built amplifier circuit feels like a hack but works around the voltage level issues adequately without the mezzanine board which was not available at the time the course was prepared.,4
38604,Thank you for this course. I enjoyed it and learnt a lot.,4
38605,this course is for very beginner in java or in coding so recommended this course to only those who are beginner otherwise it is good if you loose your hands on programming then to cleanup your hands it's very helpful,4
38616,"Good course but I think it is better for peaple with some programming background and be prepered for third week, it is lot to do.",4
38630,Pretty much code assignments help to understanding the concepts. Quite good for beginners.,4
38644,It could done better,4
38645,This is a good course but there's some flaws (not about knowledge),4
38652,very interesting course for beginners and wannabe app developers,4
38655,"It's a good course, but you do need programming experience. Also, takes twice as much time as they say, at least. Also, third week of course has a lot of work, while fourth week has very little. Would be nice to balance them out. I did get a lot out of the course and plan to continue with this specialization.",4
38656,"Awesome content, all the requiered foundations for the real beginning in the Android world.",4
38665,"I wouldn't recommend this to student who has never programmed in any computer language before. A bright, aggressive, student could learn this material with help of online examples, etc. The basic language features, etc, are pretty straight forward, but the object oriented features are probably too advanced for someone 3 weeks into programming. As an experienced programmer in other languages (C++ / Python / Perl) I found it was about the right pace to do in addition to my real job, and am looking forward to the rest of the series coming online.",4
38671,"Learn Java first, as they go through it at an agile pace.",4
38678,Content was good. But organization could have been better. Assignments and auto-grader had issues and the problem statements were modified during the course.,4
38686,Good course!!. the approach is well-balanced (no superficial and at the same time not too much professional). The quiz are done very well.,4
38690,"Good course on Java and OOP, Android it's a sort of pretext, but it's ok",4
38691,"A good introduction to java programming, the mentor team was really helpful and interactive and it was a pleasure to interact with them!Unfortunately, it is clear that this course still needs to be polished: some assignments contained mistakes or where even bugged. Mistakes and bugs have been fixed when they were reported but it still left an ""amateur"" aftertaste (especially considering that we had to wait for a few weeks for this course).",4
38696,Excellent introduction to the world of Android. Crisp and well-delivered lectures.,4
38700,Quite basic and clear for JAVA beginners,4
38702,"It's about 4.4 actually. Not enough to give 5 though.First about positive sides. I think course is well structured (except for a few minor drawbacks), quizzes fit to the material. An assignments truly buck up the material. And I think material give a grounding in future Android Development.But I think it can be problem with the learning process, mostly with programming assignment. I think it's common that when course come out for the first time it's almost inevitably that there are some issues with autograder. It' s just common. But these issue are usually easy to spot, because the output of autograder contains test cases. So one can easily find out what the problem is, if it's with autograder. As for this course, the autograder output is very minimalistic, and if the problem is with autograder it's rather hard to spot. I myself spent entire evening, trying to find what is wrong with my code, and it was pure luck that I finely spotted the problem (and, yes, it was autograder issue). Such thing could be very frustrating, really.Another problem with programming assignments is about Peer Review. The students actually get access to assessment criteria, after they have submitted they code. And their code not necessary fit these criteria. I think it could spoil the learning process as well.I actually aware that these drawbacks can be corrected in release course, and if they will be, I will be glad to change the rating.",4
38704,"The content of the curse was brilliant, fascinating and very interesting. However, the instructions for doing the assignments were sometimes not entirely clear or even conflicting (as in the first week assignment, where in the overview page it was said that you should do a video with you AND another person and the submission page said it was a video with you OR another person). There also seemed to be no instructor around to clarify this issues or help with questions or problems the classmates had. Still, a great course that I would recommend anyone interested in education, teaching and learning to do, with a lot of amazing references and material, and given by a school that is really worried about their students learning and want their voices to be heard :)",4
38705,I saw some new things.,4
38707,Thoroughly enjoyed this course and feel it has improved me as a teacher. Assignment criteria could be clearer. Excellent compliment to the blended learning course.,4
38708,Accessible and filled with interesting resources to help you explore new learning models and foundational education concepts.,4
38720,"Good content, the quiz questions with free-form text input could do with some improvement/guidance.",4
38726,"A bit more of enthusiasm should be used by the speakers, otherwise it's a good overview.",4
38730,"kinda weird how the course was marked as completed and showed the certificate before i finished the final labi wish the navigation on the left menu had a level of hierarchy - it's ugly looking with every single element as it's own element with lots of vertical paddingfor some reason the sysops course (Google Cloud Platform for Systems Operations Professionals)i doesn't recognize that i've completed the course, even though my accomplishments section has the certificate. it continues to think i'm not enrolled in the current section (e.g. the specific gcp-security course, and tells me to enroll) at the parent course level (Google Cloud Platform for Systems Operations Professionals), while the individual courses eventually do reflect that i've completed it. ultimately the certificate is listed accurately so that's all i really care about, but this is a bit annoying.",4
38734,Basic course. Highly recommended for new people to GCP,4
38745,"Excellent course for those that would like to understand how to leverage the Google Cloud Platform to create, deploy and maintain applications.",4
38762,"Great course, but really dense so better be ready to put in the work. Might be a bit heavy on the law side for IT/economics professionals, but the professor is surely a fellow geek.",4
38766,Loving it.,4
38773,"It was a little different than I expected (more litigations and law in general), but A LOT of new information nevertheless.",4
38780,"This course was very informative to me personally as I am a ""millennial"" and was born into the digital. A few points of criticism to Dr. Picker, however, given that the title includes law and economics, I had a feeling throughout most of the course that we were learning more about Law than Economics. The few segments where he broke away and described net-neutrality as an economic device was perfect in that structure, but if that could be applied (with some of the hypo examples he used) in those other terminology areas, I would not be saying law outweighed economics. I must admit I only come from reading economic books by physical Economists (never took principles) so I may not see things the way he does, but I just want to make clear that someone like me welcomes Economic charts, graphs, empirical testing with defining that field's jargon. Other than that it was a series of lectures and crafted very scholarly.",4
38794,"Fantastic Professor who is witty and really into the topics! A little more variety in the structure of the videos (not always him standing in front of the screen), but some little films, guests and so would have made 5/5 stars.",4
38807,Simply amazing with good real life examples!,4
38810,"The course work was clear and well organized. Sometimes I did not understand the Edna, the teacher which is fine however sometimes the corresponding transcript indicated that what I heard was correct and that the words she said did not make sense grammatically. Nothing to get hung up on as I received the idea, which is the point.",4
38812,A complete overview of the communications mix.,4
38816,some of the audio is difficult to understand at the firms,4
38826,"Nice course, instructor is so pretty :p and gives all detail. But those who are weak in English , may face problem to follow. Never the less, good course from one of the best B-School in the world.(IE ranks 12 in Global MBA ranking by FT)",4
38841,"Very good course, though a bit difficult to grasp the concept in only a few weeks time.",4
38842,"Another excellent course taught by Colleen. This time I'll give only four stars because I didn't enjoy the last week of the course. But besides that, it was a very good course.",4
38845,"The course materials are good and give you an idea about html, css and js. The downside is the presenter attitude towards the students presenting like she is talking to 4th graders.",4
38847,It is very useful to me and it is a good opportunity to all to use this course.,4
38858,Good for learning JavaScript!,4
38866,Easy way for beginners to start interacting with webpages.,4
38870,good if you're really a beginner.,4
38871,"Very cool course. Though level is Basic but Coleen is super start and the course material is nicely presented. The only thing i regrete - lack of practice materials. LIke they do in some other courses, there could be a training section (optional) with tons of exerceise on each module.I would take any course with Coleen as instructor in future. The Best presenter after David Malon.",4
38872,"Easy to learn and catch up for those with a computer science background, informative and useful for those who don't have much of programming experience.",4
38877,Good Introductory course for JavaScript.!,4
38878,This was tough! But worth it! You'll definitely have some scripting to do with websites so you might as well start here. :),4
38883,Course covers only the basics of basics.,4
38888,Great course!,4
38890,really helped,4
38893,"Great course, thank you!",4
38898,This was a good introductory course. It was confusing at times to follow. Maybe one or two more lectures about functions would help.,4
38901,Little bit short,4
38902,Assignments were kind of difficult even with notes. Good course overall though.,4
38904,"Good. It covers the basics of JavaScript. Easy to follow and complete. Teacher explains the concepts clearly. If you're getting your hands on JavaScript for first time, this course will help you a lot understand the basics.",4
38920,This course covers the part of javascript that is used to interact with DOM. The lectures are clear and lucid in explaining the content. The difficulty level of the assignments is easy.,4
38926,Good basic learning course in javascript. Most of the students dont know even the simple basic concepts related to web design. Those can be covered in this course...Happy Coding Everybody.,4
38930,Very Nice!,4
38932,"Good course to get basics of JS. I took 3nd such course, but find something new and interest. Sometimes it feels a little higgledy-piggledy. But I like that style, this adds real emotions. You don't sleep! :) I only want assigment tasks to be a little harder.",4
38933,This course was refreshing as I was always found JS kind of daunting. I found that I really enjoy programming and I will continue to study and practise...,4
38938,"it is a basic class for javascript learner, also provided with HTML basics. Good for people have little knowledge about web programming.",4
38951,"Perfect to start in the Javascript technology, very starter but practical.",4
38958,Nice Course.Good Explanations.,4
38959,Great course for beginners! Had expected to get a little understanding of an object oriented approach to JavaScript from the projects in the course. Hopefully there would be some other upcoming course with a higher difficulty level meeting my expectations!,4
38967,"Excellent course to learn javascript applied to frontend. I didnt give 5 points just because i felt the final assignment was too easy and that the course should have go just a bit deeper, like applying iteration to apply changes in class elements.Still Colleen is an excellent teacher, really helps to understand stuff, maybe the course feel easy just because of her teaching skills.",4
38985,"I was very reticent about this course because Js was the one code I hadn't even really done at all. With HTML & CSS, I had done and had a basic knowledge;but Dr Van Lent makes it easier to grasp and understand with the material she presents and the assignments. You are really forced to become a better coder, problem-solver and researcher as well during these 4 week courses.",4
38987,It didn't give us enough knowledge to cover the final assignment. Need to research a lot online.,4
38990,A fine course for Java Script. I would recommend having a firm grasp of Css and HTML as well as some beginning javascript before this course as the beginning is a bit rocky.,4
38991,"very brief, I would have needed to learn a bit more logical iterations",4
38993,I have learned the basics very well along with handson experience,4
39002,Excellent course for start having knowledge of JavaScript.,4
39014,Good course. 1st week is a little fast. The other weeks are much better. It needs to be a longer course though covering many additional topics. Or offer it as additional courses for more JavaScript.,4
39016,The way of teaching is nice.But they need to provide live practice after every session .in free.As I know codepen is not free of cost.so please provide practice session after every session.so that the prasctice can be done more and more and student will be benefited a lot by this,4
39019,Good for complete beginners.,4
39025,Nice course for basic java script. But price is too high.,4
39030,"Covers the basis, and things to build on.",4
39035,Thanks a lot for putting together the course content so neatly. It was a good course.,4
39038,"Very well explained, but it should have been called ""Basic Javascript"" because I'm sure many topics are missing. Moreover, the lecturer kept on saying ""Now stop and write some code"" but it's pretty hard to imagine a code from scratch, so I would suggest having (many) more exercises. (The existing ones were also very simple)",4
39050,"A nice overview, but may be too much basics were provided rather than some indepth knowledge of more complex parts of javascript.",4
39051,"Good. Probably could use more assignments or links to further tutorials. The final assignment's instructions as they are written mislead English as a Second Language students to use methods that don't contribute to the functionality required in the script.A prior review from a longterm coder who was previously apprehensive of JavaScript before taking this course echoes 80% of my sentiments. This is a gentle but robust introduction for the intimidated, and success in this course is a confidence boost.",4
39052,"This wasn't as easy to understand as the HTML and CSS classes. I think it's because it wasn't as clear to me what JavaScript was and how it affected the computer. It sort of felt like jumping into something I couldn't wrap my brain around. That said, I still learned a lot and enjoyed the videos.",4
39053,Good project for javascript learners,4
39054,It was very easy and slow for a person who has coding experience. I was looking for more tips and tricks.,4
39059,Nice objectives and clear instruction.,4
39061,Especially the DOM part is really good :),4
39064,"Was hoping for a little bit more than what was offered. However, the course was well put together and I would definitely take a course from this instructor again.",4
39068,"Definitely a beginner course, and the pace seemed good for what it was intended to be.",4
39079,"I think this course does a pretty good of introducing JavaScript. It covers the essentials of how to create functions and implement event handlers that react to the users, which is the most common use of JS. As an introductory course, it correctly assumes some of its audience has no prior programming background. However, it is difficult to teach programming in such a short time. As an experienced programmer, I would recommend reviewing the order in which some of the concepts are presented to try to help in this aspect.I was personally hoping that the final assignment would be a bit more challenging, but it was very straightforward. Form handling (the topic in the final week) is certainly where I've used JS the most during my career, so I was glad that it was given special attention.Again, this is a really good course for beginners; Dr. Van Lent is awesome.",4
39082,"very clear content , easy to follow and understand . first step in the word of javascriptthank you so much",4
39083,"It is too short course and this module is very basic and short , so much more to talk about JS but instructor is good.",4
39084,A bit too superficial.,4
39094,Very basic course.,4
39097,"Clear lectures, but the assignments were a little too trivial to solidify what was learned.",4
39101,"Not intended as comprehensive, but a very good starting point for understanding JS.",4
39104,Nice introduction to start coding with javascript,4
39116,Very good explanations ! I wish I learned with this class when I learned JS for the first time !,4
39118,Professor does a good job in explaining and gives a heads up of the general errors encountered in real life working with js,4
39121,There was a little bit less Javascript than I expected. But the course is good intro for beginners.,4
39131,"this course is awesome , i'm going to learn JS Fundamental programming",4
39132,"Very good like the 2 previous courses. It could have gone a bit farther though, but very clear explanations.",4
39134,"Nice course, gives a good overview about the language. Although I have found their introduction to html and css3 better.",4
39135,"As the instructor rightly mentions - the course is just the first step and still leaves you at the ""noob"" level. It'd be great if there is a follow-up course that digs deeper.",4
39136,nice one !useful,4
39143,"Good course if you want to learn how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS elements to make site pages more engaging but don't have a lot of time for lengthy lectures or assignments that take hours. There's room for the course to grow though. There's so much more a web designer can do with JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and provide a great experience for a site user, and I feel the instructor fell short in explaining event handlers and other cool animation trends seen in the industry. But I understand that this is for new web designers who may or may not be completely interested in programming as opposed to front-end design, so Colleen's teaching provides a good balance.Love the fact that the lectures are straight to the point. I was able to finish 4 weeks of material in less than 3 days, which for someone busy like me, is awesome!",4
39153,the course is very good for new poeple on javascript and programming in general but it's tedious for people who who a bit of js or have a programming background as it goes on to talk about very basic stuff like variables and arrays anyone with 2 months experience in software know this conceptsi suggest you add that this course is for the real noobies of js or programming in general,4
39170,Nice to keep it up!,4
39176,"Everything perfect, but developing apps that makes use of iphone and iwatch/appletv screens. Not a clue about how to communicate one with another. Good to develop standalone iphone, iwatch or appletv apps, though.",4
39182,"Lectures are great! And it would be better if we can see all the code from video, yet in week 1 lecture3, some function been blocked and I am not sure if I do it right by myself. Download code may be an option, yet it is better for us to type code by following the lecture, because downloading makes me lazy, typing code by ourselves is a good way to learn. Thank you so much!",4
39193,Learned a lot in this part of the specialisation!,4
39196,I would prefer if the course was more focused on iPhone/iPad instead on WatchOS and Apple TV.,4
39200,Great,4
39204,Its a very good course for those interested in Image Processing. The professor has a wide knowledge in this field and one will learn more after going through the recommended books. You will also learn a bit of MATLAB for Image processing in this course.,4
39215,this course is awesome and useful for someone who are intermediate and beginner in imp!! :),4
39220,I feel like 8 weeks was too short and the project was too rushed. But overall of good value.,4
39223,"A great course all in all. Some of the instructions for projects have not directly translated out of the classroom so could do with a review, but overall I really enjoyed it and I did learn lots!Thanks, Scott.",4
39257,Good. Week 4 was very challenging.,4
39267,Good cours,4
39272,Had a wonderful study with this course.,4
39284,"I would suggest to remake the lessons. The speech by the author is very interesting, but the images are a bit poor (and boring) in the sense of not completing to much their explainations. Thanks.",4
39307,Very constructive and helpful,4
39309,"A little bit ambiguous and vague, however it gets better in the next sessions in my opinion.",4
39324,"I learned a lot in this course about all the ways one can find info online about your product/business. Some of the guest lecture videos didn't hold my attention all that well, but I'm glad we had their perspective.",4
39327,Great really useful!,4
39328,"Found difficult to use Semantria and IBM Bluemix. They were not user friendly and the videos were too limited, and did not show how to use the rest. It´s a shame that we are given 6 months to use, but no tools to take advantage of it.",4
39338,A very interesting course. A step-by-step guide on how to deploy the Bluemix App would have helped. That's the only thing missing.,4
39339,A really interesting and useful course!,4
39342,Thank you. Excellent information.,4
39344,"Great follow-up from the What is Social, with lots of practical examples. I have enjoyed this course and strongly advise to follow it",4
39345,"I almost need to come back and listen to these lectures again. This course is pretty technical -- it involves several different digital tools. I found that it was possible to do well on the quizzes without really mastering the technical tools. Now that I'm trying to put them into use more fully, I find I don't understand them as well as I should have. I take responsibility for perhaps not pushing to understand the first time -- but I also encourage Coursera and @RandyHlavac to perhaps include something more than ""did you get an account?"" checks for the tools -- to make sure students grasp how to use the tools before they move on.",4
39354,Great content and wonderful presenters.,4
39357,Learned a lot through the course. Will recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how to be effective in social media,4
39359,"We all hear about big data and it's core role at information society. This course helped me understand how we actually use big data to interact with people. I also realised that we don't need to be part of a big company to work with big data. There are tools available for every person, some of them for free.",4
39361,The material is very Helpful,4
39362,"This course was informative. I especially loved the interview with Tressie from Taco Bell. I feel like I learned a lot from her. The only part I did not enjoy from this course was the Peer to Peer assignment. Don't get me wrong, the assignment was very informative. I love the concept of peer to peer assignments because I get to learn so much more in different sectors. However, socialmention.com was NOT working for me. It was very slow and I could not even load the page. I had to go to a cafe with high speed internet in order to load my keywords, hashtags, and influencers, but I couldn't until the last day (which is why I handed in my assignment late). Other than that, this course was (probably) better than the first one.",4
39368,The Bluemix video wa a bit confusing and my promo code didn't work and I never received a reply on how to get it to work.,4
39380,Nice class,4
39382,"Fantastic, just want to get that one quiz figured out so I don't loose marks for questions that didn't apply? help",4
39388,"the course is interesting, but i honestly enjoyed the first course more",4
39398,"In this course, Randy Hlavac does a deeper dive into the importance of social media monitoring and gives a nice overview of some key social listening tools available on the market today.",4
39401,This class provides great tools and approaches to power you social marketing efforts. Hands on and supportive to get you going.,4
39402,"Parts of it seemed a bit salesy, but I really enjoyed the insights from Tressie Lieberman.",4
39411,It is a comprehensive one covering breadth of IoT and related concepts,4
39416,C,4
39419,"Descriptive, easy to understand concept, simple language was the highlight of the lectures. More examples on aspects that are complex would be highly appreciated.",4
39422,Thanks.,4
39431,A great course for introduction to IoT.,4
39438,good one to understand the basic concept of the AR and IoT. the explaination is superficial and definite exatly the way its needed just to get a basic insight into the concepts...,4
39446,it was short but gave a crisp overview of the technology.liked it...,4
39447,Good introduction,4
39448,It help me to get the basics of IOT and AR.,4
39450,A good introduction but fairly simple for someone who already has some basis.,4
39452,good for learning and intresting,4
39465,"Goog Introduction to Internet of Things & Augmented Reality Emerging Technologies, I expected a little more",4
39468,A good introductory course to IoT and AR technologies,4
39470,Good Course,4
39471,This was a great course - Only suggestion would be to add more acronym definition information for the layperson like me :0),4
39476,Interesting course!,4
39479,Interesting & Informative.,4
39485,Very good and easy to follow. Lectures are complete with all information needed and quizzes are appropriately challenging.,4
39492,Nice to see these videos about new technologies.,4
39498,"Just what I have been looking for.It is a basic course, where the teacher reads out loud what is shown on the page and adds some comments. The information is correct and useful, I really liked it.",4
39503,Quite informative but could have better with some practical knowledge and practical homeworks.,4
39504,It was a great pleasure to join the lectures and be a part of this course.,4
39507,Basic but interesting and informative,4
39510,Really good explanation of IoT and AR. This course gave me a basic knowledge of all those things.,4
39513,Good course!!!Help me to know about IoT and AR...,4
39518,"Great course for those looking for a fast-track brief on IoT and AR. The course offers a very quick and concise view of both IoT and AR technologies and their industry applications.Some of the basic architecture for both IoT and AR is very useful information for future reference and for accelerated learning.However, some of the training content (only about 10%) may be better absorbed with some formal knowledge of communication and networking systems. To state a couple of examples - IoT talks about 'packet' distribution which is a core networking topic and anyone with no prior background may struggle to fully grasp it. Similarly, some of the technicalities of image scanning in AR could have been left out in my opinion. Having said that, none of these 'technical' aspects figure in the course quiz, which limits to testing basic functional understanding, which is what the course aims to teach.",4
39522,Augmented Reality Technology is now being used in simulators as well. No mention about this application was provided.,4
39523,"Interesting, i learnt a lot about the new used technologies.",4
39528,Excellent course if anyone wants to take up Journalism in the future.,4
39531,"Very good! There's room for improvement in the assignments, especially the quizzes that have simple questions and some have only one.",4
39533,"Thank you for sharing the Course. The course provides clear guidance and always reminding how important it is to be an ethical journalist. With the assignments for each lesson at each week push us to be more creative in ideas of preparing and planning news and types of resources.Appreciate, and hoping that Coursera will always be there for us who look forward to update and learn knowledge that can help us in compete with the current always changing world, the same time as Coursera will keep on updating and considering on the comments/reviews from your Learners.Would be great if the courses presented could be totally affordable and free for all :)",4
39534,"A basic course into ethics, principles etc of a journalist. Assignments are straight forward and interesting.",4
39539,It was more of generic project management course than an IT project management course. The content was also too much quantitative based in nature than qualitative. More experience based learning would have been useful.,4
39541,"Though the course teaches you IT project management in a crisp way, but I felt that it was a little too fast paced.",4
39545,"I really liked this course , I only rated it 4 stars, because I think the history part was too big",4
39555,"great course! awesome,i have learned many of the things from this coursei would like to thanks dr. chuck tell about these studies",4
39570,"Just Awesome, key lectures on the internet.",4
39578,"good for those who gets start to learn the internet, also helpful to clear up knowledge while reading relevant books.but some of the courses are still a little bit messy to me, which need to be learnt by myself further after class",4
39584,"Dr. Chuck has created a great course for those interested in learning the basics of Internet History, technology, and security, that is approachable even for those who aren't well versed in computer science.",4
39588,I learned a lot about the under pinning of the internet and how various things worked together on it.,4
39604,"I had so many ""a-ha moments"" in this class. I recommend for anyone interested in how the Internet works and why. The interviews with the people that were there at the moment of create really helped not just to humanize this historic achievement, but also to provide context. Well done!",4
39612,"Fascinating interviews of the bright minds that were involved with the early computers, networks, and internet.",4
39624,"A lot of the assessments for the ""history"" section of the course are needless factual-item recall, and not very cognitively challenging or engaging. The combination of history/technology/security could be more tightly integrated, it feels like three discrete courses just merged together into one. Good material overall, just not sure the scale/scope is appropriate to one course.",4
39634,Very informative course if you want to learn the basics of internet technology and security.,4
39641,The course was interesting and low maintenance. The lectures could have been snappier and more to the point.,4
39645,Learnt a lot of stuff and had a great time! thank you Dr.Chuck,4
39671,A really interesting and relevant course. Replayable and pause-able video lectures are obviously the way to go. The software-driven transcription of the lectures is useful but needs a lot of reformatting and some error correction (this process is not a bad learning tool in its own right!),4
39681,"A fun journey through the history and structure of the internet. This is a thorough but brief introduction. Well worth your time to check out if you're interested in history, technology, programming or just finding out something new. The diversity of interviews is impressive, although there is overlap with Dr. Chuck's other courses.",4
39685,I didn't really understand a lot of concepts,4
39688,"The course is very interesting, even for IT pros.",4
39689,"I strongly recommend this course, it is very well explained. very engaging.",4
39695,"Give a broad overview of Internet, seems good",4
39700,It was a really fun course. I Learn a ton even though was already familiar with the topics covered.,4
39722,I enjoyed learning more about the technology we take for granted and how we got to where we're at. I thought Dr. Chuck presented the material in a very relatable and engaging manner and I would recommend other courses offered by him. Thank you for the education!,4
39723,Lots of fun learned alot.,4
39730,awesome and informative course,4
39733,"Absolutely love this course, I remember when the internet was becoming a big thing.",4
39741,Good stuff. Informative overview and fun teacher,4
39751,"Dear Dr Chuck (If you're reading this)Firstly thank you so much. I am currently in my 3rd year of B.E in Information Technology and wish that networking was taught to me like this from the start. Not just how we use protocols, standards and Layers but the reason and history of their existence. It was a lovely experience even though I didn't maximize any of your tests. Just a few things that I thought you could have covered in the course. From the first internet to the web servers and world wide web, you covered all aspects of the currently visible web. However we know that the internet is not only limited to that. If you would've given an insight on how the the deep/dark web came into being, that in my mind would cover every portion of the net today.Regardless of that, it was a lovely course and I really admire your way of teaching !However I still have no clue how I could have answered the number of hops from Michigan to Harvard !",4
39760,"This course enables you to have basic knowledge into the what we call the internet, how it started, what technologies, protocols and how much research work has gone into the internet. also gives you an insight into the security aspect of the web which i believe every learned person should know.",4
39762,Great at teaching the basics of Internet. Quizzes should be more challenging. I liked very much the videos.,4
39767,"Video quality is poor. The content is quite interesting, but while navigating, the quality of the video disturbs me. It would be better, if you can upgrade this.",4
39776,"Nice course! Provides a good basis in understanding the Internet, where it originated from and how it works. Mr. Severance is an excellent tutor and I really liked his videos and keynotes. He makes the material come to live.",4
39781,"I learned a lot about *how* the internet works, which makes this course totally worth the time I spent on it.",4
39793,"Nice course,good video'sive been int he IT since 84 and seen most of it...",4
39806,"This course is quite interesting for people who want to understand the development of the biggest network in the world - the Internet, understand the basics of network-related technology, and security techniques for digital transaction. However, the review questions are fairly easy.",4
39822,The course is teached with good humor and an easy to understand method. Congratulation Dr. Chuck.,4
39826,I recommand this Course for any one who want to know the history of Internet and technology.,4
39833,Very useful..,4
39846,This is a very good course for those who know very little about the internet or computers and is a fantastic stepping-stone for doing other computer science course latter,4
39860,"Great course, the peer-editing could be improved or find a different mode of judgement.",4
39869,It is generally a good course. What I didn't like was the fact that the assignments were too hard.,4
39872,I definitely learned some new things during the course. Some of the explanations were a bit concise for someone with limited experience wth improvisation. That is understandable given the length and cost of this course. I would recommend it to others to gain some new knowledge and get a feel for taking online courses from Berklee via Coursera.,4
39884,Great Course !,4
39889,"Kinda have to learn to Improvise yourself, he teaches you tricks to make it better, but not *how* to improvise. However, it's impossible to generally state how to improvise, you just eventually learn.",4
39894,Excellent and Challenging! Learnt a lot and if you are working toward a certificate you really need to set aside time to earn a pass for each assignment.Few glitches when it came to grading and assignment instructions. BUT the discussion board is really helpful and interactive. The TA's also provide timely help.,4
39911,Great lessons i would hope it would be more extensive in terms of lessons. I hoped for more detailed technical music theory.,4
39927,Very good!But it isn't for beginner players.,4
39946,"this is a good course, just I thing who want enroll the course need a few knows about music, but really I recommend the course",4
39954,Informative and interesting.It could be more complete in my opinion.Burton is great.,4
39958,maybe extends the material a little bit more?,4
39967,Awesome documentary! Just sad that we can't do this course without having to subscribe. Is there any way to make it more accessible? Such as allowing the non-paying students to submit quizzes and assignments?,4
39990,"The course is really really great, the reason that i gave it 4 stars not 5 is only because the professor has been frequently promoting for his personal book!",4
39993,Great course. It really re-ignited my interest in history.,4
39997,A nice course about Kennedy. I didn't know much about him and this course make me able a little more to understand his qualities and his drawbacks.,4
40005,"Great course! I definitely enjoyed watching every single video and doing my own side reasearch on things I wanted to learn a little bit more about. I did buy the book, but that is also something I didn't like about the course. It seemed like the course's sole purpose was to get us to buy the book. There were so many moments where it would have sufficed to expand or explain something a little further, instead of just giving us an inconclusive idea and then tell us to check the book. This made it look and feel more like an advertisement for the book. But despite all that, I learned a lot and it was a great topic and wonderfully prepared. You just have to ignore the book deal.",4
40008,"History made easy, helps understanding a lot of the things going on now in the scenario of politics in America",4
40014,good course. professor tries to sell his book too much. it's emba,4
40019,"Nice course, it's content is highly tied to it's title. It gives you an overview over the US presidents since JFK not only him, also some information before he took the leadership.You can finish it in 5 days or less !",4
40033,"The course is very useful in helping you understand team dynamics and their roots in structures and, I feel even more importantly, the norms and behavioral practices that we develop in groups. There are very good leads onto how to put it into practice. My perception was that the last quarter on team performance and learning (which might be critical for actual success) was rather superficial in comparison to the other topics covered.",4
40035,"good course, lots of tips and information useful tu be used in real work environment",4
40045,"Very good course for freshers. It was well planned and educational course. Please keep up the Good Work. It is said that ""Knowledge is Power"" and I really mean it, after completing the course.",4
40058,Good course. I immediately recognised some of the situations that were discussed. The analysis about the effects of values vs demographic vs cultural differences in teams. Are especially good.,4
40059,Very good information. Instructors were easy to understand and had a relatable approach,4
40067,"Interesting Course, I learnt a lot.",4
40073,A good course. Although within this University of Michigan specialization there are ones that I found more captivating so check out the whole specialization.,4
40077,"It is a good course, gives you fresh perspective and insight into leading a team. The course helped me to look into our team structure with fresh perspective.",4
40078,"Great and very functional Course, with numerous Statistics to establish correlations.",4
40080,As most other parts of this specialization this course was excellent.,4
40086,"Very good course, lots of applicable knowledge.",4
40089,Really nice! Learned a lot! Would have been nice though to get the powerpoint slides and a bit more extra material for us to be able to access it for the final assignment and also for the future! I had a lot of fun taking this course though. Great teachers too.,4
40096,"Overall good course but the course instructors should made the slides for the lectures available. It would be very important, with the capstone course coming soon, and having the need to review all courses that the slides for all courses cold be made available. Wharton, Illinois, Yale make the slides available in their top tier courses, and it is very important.",4
40107,"Really usefull course for me as a team leader in an international organization, This course provides me with worthy informations and lessons that are useful for me in managing my team in an efficient way,",4
40108,"Quite good approach to the topic.This is a topic that runs the risk of being thought via cliches and banalities (it's important to inspire people, leading is about motivating, be responsible and have accountability, etc). But this course did a good job in going beyond these. I enjoyed it and the written assignments force you to think through the issues.",4
40111,It's a very good introductory course of BIM. But the reading content can actually convert into lectures which could be more attractive. Some of the assignments contain out-of-class information and brought me a little bit of trouble. Hope this part of content could be included into lectures.,4
40112,ESTE CURSO TE FACILITA HERRAMIENTAS SENCILLAS PARA ADMINISTRAR MEJOR TUS INGRESOS Y TIPS DE INVERSION PARA INCREMENTAR TU PATRIMONIO.,4
40114,Very useful and well explained.,4
40116,is good for person who do not have a knowledge about finances,4
40119,Very good course. I enjoyed taking it.,4
40123,is a good course to know basic knowledge about finanzas. so good,4
40126,I was enjoy this course ¡¡,4
40132,Great introduction to the specialization!,4
40139,I very much enjoyed the teaching style and the interactive assignments,4
40146,Needs better instruction on assignments,4
40152,"Thank you for the course, it was really useful! I like to get some knowledge about story boarding, paper and video prototyping and especially heuristic evaluation technics. Only thing I would change is to have more real examples and visual materials. Sometimes I did not understand material and I would happy to see examples.",4
40157,"Was fairly good, but I was a little let down by the lack of direction on the assignments. Assignment number two was very poor in my opinion. The videos are excellent though.",4
40161,I think the course helps to set a base for this. Gives a flavour and texture to HCD and helps take a plunge into it. Hopefully as the specialization goes along... it would become more advanced and indepth.,4
40164,Gives you good end-to-almost-till-the-end experience on a project from needfinding to user research to storyboarding.,4
40169,Would be great if we get the feedback and reviews from lecturer or professor rather the from the peer reviews.,4
40178,Great starting point for software design.,4
40182,"This is a great course I've learned a lot. I felt, that the assignments were not balanced right, the first one was way more challenging than the others.",4
40186,"Overall it's good, especially helpful for a novice like me. However, I did overcome some learning barriers in this class: PPTs are too theoretical, eg. there are quite a few PPTs full of words, and PPTs like that would easily drive me distracted and sleepy. Hopefully it'll be better^ ^",4
40190,Very well laid out Course structure. Would have loved some more practical and relevant examples of existing apps/processes,4
40194,"Pretty good course on User Centered Interface Design. Rich, clear and very well documented",4
40195,A great course to revise existing knowledge and to get some new tips in HCD. Warmly recommended!,4
40196,"Very well designed. Estimated time required to complete the assignments were inappropriate, it took me longer.",4
40198,"Overall fantastic course with great content and homework assignments. The difficulty level was a little low, and the amount of work we were required to do was a little less than I wanted / expected. Sometimes the peer grading was not accurate, and I wish there had been more feedback in the discussion forums.",4
40199,Some assignments could have been better explained,4
40200,Good intro to the concepts of design.,4
40204,very interesting,4
40206,"This course was a very good introduction of HCI, videos were very clear and the heuristical theme had plenty of examples which make really easy to understand them. I would have appreciated more assignments, since there were so many topics there was many themes that could not be learned in a deeper way.",4
40210,"Amazing first hand course by Mr. Klemmer. He is very informative and clear onto his lectures. The assignments feel relevant and are just in the right doses. I have learned HCD in Industrial Design School before but Mr. Klemmer hits it out better out of the park. For the first time, I've actually understood and wrapped my head around the topic of HCD.",4
40214,One of the best courses I have attended. Value for money. A special thanks to the instructor who did a pretty good job in explaining things in a simple yet efficient way.,4
40215,The assignments could have been more rigorous. Coursera should review the assignment submission process. I lost points (despite handing in a 100% worthy assignment) because my peers found it difficult to locate necessary information on my submission due to Coursera's system.,4
40216,"Interesting, though instructor's participation and help could have been more noticable. The course has way many blank gaps and question, and all these questions are clarified by students - each with his own understanding. I think the instructor must be a person to answer all the question about the course. Thanks.",4
40222,Some of the videos feel a little outdated but otherwise high quality.,4
40223,Awesome course! It would be more awesome if the assignments were easier to understand.,4
40226,"Good class, except for quizzes were complicated at times. User input instructions was not clear.",4
40227,This really helped me scope products before building them,4
40230,"Not a great deal in the way of lectures and notes, but the value of the course lies in the hands-on assignments. Would recommend taking this course along with doing some independent reading for a more comprehensive primer of UX/UI.",4
40232,"Good lessons, interesting content. But media is a bit old fashioned, I missed more interactive activities and more modern videos.",4
40233,Great introduction to human-centered design conceptually applicable across multiple disciplines.,4
40250,Its good start of for this course.,4
40263,Very useful.,4
40275,"Very good info, fun assignments just be sure to stay up to date week after week, the information, fresh, is a real help. Thanks alot.",4
40281,"Overall good; some of the projects were a tad light, and there were some bugs I'd like to see fixed, but good.",4
40286,"Great course! the final exam is very odd though, the ""correct"" answers didn't fit easily in what was taught. several subjective questions",4
40290,It's good!,4
40298,Very helpful for understanding the basics of UX process.,4
40303,"This was a pretty good course. Assignment 1, especially, was very useful (conducting a need-finding interview). The storyboarding assignment was good, too. The assignments weren't always very clearly written, and I could tell from my peer-grading experience that some of the students had trouble understanding what was asked, especially the non-native English speakers.",4
40309,Expecting more content like the actuall experience of creating wireframe. step by step and finally complete wireframe.,4
40315,Very detailed and structured content. Is it possible to get printable content as well along with videos?,4
40316,I learnt a lot and was able to take the course at my own pace. It was really insightful doing the peer reviews as I learnt from my peers experiences as well.,4
40317,"I find the discipline very interesting but the course was somewhat boring (except the tasks - the tasks were nice and interesting). The lectures were, to my recollection, the boring piece which reduces the score to 4 out of 5.",4
40318,Well organized and the videos explain a lot. The are some resources named in the videos but the links are missing.,4
40323,"I wish we could still get a course certificate, even if you haven't paid.",4
40324,I THINK THAT IS COURSE IS VERY GOOD. ONLY MUCH REQUERIMENTS FOR SEND WORK.HOW CHECK KEYBOARD AND SEND PHOTO WITH CAMERA IN THE MOMENT.WHEN THE CAMERA NOT WORK FOR DRIVERS USB AND ITS COULD SEND FILE PHOTO.,4
40328,"good clips but annoying music almost in the foreground, hard to hear voices sometimes.",4
40330,"Really fun and interesting class if you want to learn a lot more details about a fantastic time in science history. Videos could be improved somewhat avoiding repeating information included in lecture pdfs. Other than that, everything was great!",4
40335,Enjoy the subject matter very much. I didn't care for the layout at all.,4
40338,Clear easy overview with great archival video,4
40342,"nice videos, good compilation of materials that make learning about this part of history easier than if on own",4
40343,"At the rate we are probing space, I think we should all take this course.",4
40346,"A good introduction to the History of Spaceflight, was great to learn more about how the mankind could to start exploring the space.",4
40348,"A good course, but a few slight errors and the lack of the last modules leave it at 4/5 stars.",4
40355,"Fascinating overview but was hoping for a bit more depth. Did learn new things though, particulalry about the not so well publicised Apollo missions and the early Russian efforts. A couple of quiz questions were marking right answers as wrong but course team got them sorted fairly quickly",4
40365,"Very Good Course which primarily focuses on India's First and Second Generation Economic Reforms.I would personally recommend following the course 'Importance of India'after that of 'Contemporary India"" as the latter provides a solid introduction to University of OHIO based former course.I had to lop off one star because the course content tended to stray off limits in Weeks 6 and 7;To be honest, Go straight to the test after completing Week 5; which i view as the end of this course.",4
40366,Very nice course with good chronological description of events. good links for additional reading. I feel it could have been a bit more elaborate or more in depth.,4
40370,"Really liked the course and learnt about different modes of assessment and their objectives. Wish we got more about gamification of assessment, especially applying non-zero sum game philosophy.",4
40371,the course will not only give a thorough understanding of assessing learning but also assessing teaching.,4
40374,very good course .,4
40386,"Good to start programming in C language, but something used in homework doesn't mentioned in class material",4
40388,too easy so not suitable for students with some programming experience.,4
40390,clear and easy for an outsider. seful,4
40405,"The content is good but should be more organized. More instructions and explanation should be provided for exercises. Particularly, the auto grading system should be improved. Besides a simple term like ""compile error"", more explanation should be provided to help students debugging.",4
40410,a little bit difficult at the beginning,4
40411,Lecturer is pretty good,4
40414,"Very good course, recommend to take, but homework is kind of beyond what has been taught.",4
40420,"Kind of short. Could have elaborated on some things. Also, having some recruitment experience myself, this might be different in several countries.",4
40424,"Good one .. Especially for fresh grads, they'll get an idea about how to build their social image and resume so they stand out from rest of the candidates.",4
40430,"Great quick review/update on sinusitis and treatments. Straight forward, easy to follow and uncomplicated. Not ideal for those lacking some medical background.",4
40434,"It is excellent, although 4 stars as I, as an infectious disease physician now, have less capability of assessing surgical part.",4
40441,Amazing. The only suggestion i can make is about treatment. To be more practical.,4
40454,Very complete and useful. Perfect course to improve your knowledge about Sinusitis quickly.,4
40456,The course is excellent for health care professional and the speaker is amazing as he has an in-depth knowledge of the topic.,4
40459,Very good course! The teacher was knowledgeable and the material was in consonance with my expectations. My only complaint was about the quizzes which i found to be too short.,4
40466,It was an excellent course which enhanced my knowledge regrading the topic with the best faculty of Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai in association with coursera.,4
40471,"Good, broad introduction to serious embedded systems. It covers quite advanced topics, definitely not for beginners. Not that it is hard but to fully understand requires it previous knowledge and good studying skills.The course definitely needs work. Mostly it is a 5-10 min video about the topic and then a bunch of links to webpages, scientific articles, books, wiki entries, etc. that you need to read. Then a short quiz with rather specific questions about the readings. Many times it is not clear in the links what you should be looking for (sometimes its just a link to a home page) so the quiz is hard. The course needs work to make it more engaging and interactive.I specially liked the last module about battery powered devices. It could be very useful as a course on its own. I think many people would like to learn about this topic.",4
40482,Really enjoyed it.,4
40501,very good course!,4
40504,"good course, wish it went into more depth but overall worth one's time",4
40508,An interesting approach to the French Revolution time. (8/10),4
40517,"Excellent lecture for climate change. This lecture give me a deep insight for greenhouse effect and global warming with nice scientific tools and models. However, It's necessary to improve some instruction process to have student understand with more easy. For example, there are various instructions for using models. But sometimes, I have difficulties to understand some model.Anyhow, I thanks to Dr. David Archer and Coursera staff.",4
40519,"Dr. David Archer has succeeded in presenting a didactic course in which complex issues like climate and weather conditions are explained in a highly schematic and clear manner for students who do not have an academic degree in either Earth sciences or physics. The series of short video's show Dr. Archer at the blackboard explaining concepts using highly schematic and easy to understand figures. Teaching in the most elementary way, almost perfect.Completing this course also is learning by practice: there are multiple problems to solve using a wide array of models that compute the impact of greenhouse gases on temperature, humidity, ice sheets and sea levels. Finally a series of assignments require the student to explain in simple terms 'that can be understood by an 11-yr old' what are basic concepts like heat, negative feedback, fossil fuels, climate change and others. An interesting approach.Together, this is a recommended course for anyone interested in the science behind one of the most discussed changes of our planet. A Minor comment is that the videos would benefit by some change of perspective, introducing here and there images or video's that illustrate the impact of climate change on Earth systems.",4
40520,"The course was a broad overview to different areas of climate science. At the end I understood a little more deeply the mechanics of global warming, but some things could have gone in more depth. I found the quantity of assignments/quizzes to be a bit unmanageable even though some were very short. I really liked the explainer assignments. When I first saw them i thought they were going to be a bit much, but actually they were extremely helpful as they forced me to process the information learned week to week.",4
40533,"Good points: 1) Great instructor; 2) applicable content; 3) great for physics students.Bad points: 1) Lacking of a ""Formulae booklet"" to use as reminder and reference for formulas and constants - when working on the models for this course; 2) The exercises approach should be reviews, making more use of the tools available in the Coursera interface (example: Assigments in text format (discursive) should use the own coursera interface, instead make us upload .TXT or .DOC files).Extra: I did not finish the course, the format and content do not achieve my personal objectives, as a software developer and environmentalist. But i really enjoyed the general approach and goal.",4
40541,The slow pace and the simple language helps to comprehend the climate science very effectively. Thanks a lot for that. Use of fundamentals with very little work load per week is fun!,4
40546,"This course gave a very refreshing outlook towards the whole definition and concept of creativity. The videos, readings, articles and assignments were all very well thought out and makes you go wide as well as deep in your thoughts. Above all it makes you realize that creativity is indeed for everyone :)",4
40548,Very inspiring and full of engaging content,4
40550,This course helps to get those creative juices flowing. Well done.,4
40552,What I ended to rekindle the creative light in me! Thank you to the team behind this course!,4
40553,This course has been created with love. Teachers are fun to watch. It covers several creativity strategies and methods.. A lot of inspiring videos and supplemental study material is included. Weeks will pass fast. You won't regret taking this course.,4
40573,Old curriculum but the flow is great. Very helpful. Thank you!,4
40576,Very good course and material. Can be downloaded and read again .,4
40581,Good : It is a very concise course with each week session providing references to books for learning more in depth. Overall I am very satisfied and glad to take this course.Improvements: A lot of information squeezed into short videos. Students would benefit more if there are a bit more videos covering all topics in depth not just refer them to chapters in a book. Some questions are little bit ambiguous. I think reading the book along with this course is very important to understand clearly and apply it at work.,4
40582,In terms of Theory for General Software Architecture this Course is a good refresher for a person who is working with Software Architecture already.The Course could have more focused on IoT specific scenarios compared to Generic Software Architecture. What i recommend is to change the course title and have a separate one for IoT specific matters.If the presenters can provide more practical examples that will help remember how and where we can apply these scenarios.Overall this course content is good and interesting to watch.,4
40585,Excellent course as an introduction and overview of generic software architecture concepts. It would be great to get more in depth information about IOT specific patterns and technologies from the architecture trade-off perspective.,4
40586,"The course covers a wide range of aspects about Software Architecture, even beyond the scope of IoT. The peer review assignments help to put into practice some of the concepts, which may seem to be quite abstract at first glance. An improvement suggestion would be to provide more exercises to work on the case study presented in the last units, in order to take advantage of the additional material provided.",4
40587,"The course is almost focus on the SA for traditional software , not too much example, theories and miss some important core components of IoT architecture and especially is security that is also most important quality attribute for IoT project",4
40588,"Good, but not so deeply good",4
40591,"Course was helpful in giving a structure to think deeply about a difficult, nebulous topic as is influence. Appreciated all the tips and tactics",4
40602,good course with interesting speakers and insights. Research-based with practical applications.,4
40606,Quite good but could agregate more knoledge! Teachers are just awesome!,4
40616,"Really good professorsGood content, well structured and presented",4
40621,Interesting.,4
40642,"Very useful course with very good tactics to use in our daily working environment where there might be a lot of influence for personal gains, that is, manipulation.",4
40643,Good informative course. The course should cover a little bit of Change Management Concept. Well designed and planned.,4
40659,Interesting theories to help put into order what seems to be common sense! There are practical tips.,4
40663,"This course for me, was a huge step towards my leadership development.",4
40671,enough basic knowledge,4
40681,The course helps in identifying the tactics that are used frequently in order to get personal gains. It teaches how to avoid them and also use them if needed.,4
40684,"Dear CourseraThis was my first Coursera course at all. The course is in general is interesting and it give a good theoretical approach and examples how to turn this theory in practice.The discussion possibility is also very useful. Learning from your classmates is great. The discussions are respectfull and if somebody has a different opinion or view this is seen as ""added value"" and is not judged negatively.The only thing missing is the possibility to have live and direct conversation with the teachers. I did a training where we had the opportunity for one hour to ask questions in a chat and the teacher was answering them in a live webinar. That was really usefull and would make it a ""five""***** star course.Overall, I would attend/take a Coursera training any time again. Great plattform!",4
40697,The program would make you conscious of your actions as well as that of others. It's an interesting course!,4
40705,"A good, well designed course but very heavily aimed towards those mid-career in a corporate environment. Still worth a look for others, but the assignments will take significant extra thought. Sadly the discussion forums fail at bridging this gap because forum participation framed as mandatory (it is not) in the lecture videos has rendered them a wall of pure noise.",4
40706,"It is good but it should continue with some advanced course, this one seems to be very predictive..",4
40709,"I find the course content useful and well structured, but I'd wish to hear more example for the different tactics. A few things remained unclear to me. Still I am satisfied with the course and would totally recommend it! Thank you Maxim Sytch and Scott DeRue!",4
40711,"At the risk of sounding like a jerk and I am TRULY sorry for saying this but only gave this course 4 stars instead of 5 because of one of the professors, not the actual content. I actually feel like this course was GREAT, I just couldnt deal with one of the professors constant sucking of teeth or whatever in the videos and dragging out of everything. Information got repeated in different ways making everything longer and boring where I literally just kept forwarding the lessons. Besides my ""ADD"" with that one professor, I will have to admit, I loved this course.",4
40715,this course is ..... great!,4
40716,This is a great course,4
40720,I liked it a lot in style and substance. The framework of 6 elements + 1 big one (cognition) might need a bit of thought.,4
40726,"Great course. Unlike many other courses, it is quite practical and useful. I especially liked Maxim Sych part, he's a professional and a talanted teacher.",4
40728,"Good materials, good professors and very well put together cours. If there is one thing I would improve is response to questions from the students by the professors.",4
40729,"This is a good and effective course for managing your network and learning how to influence people. Many tactics are provided for learners, so we can try different ways in different situations to get a better influencing.",4
40737,Need to provide the slides for the course. The videos are excellent.,4
40743,Informative and not too long course.,4
40748,"Really good course, easy understanding and well explained as well. Concepts very useful for professional and personal life.I recommend to everyone who are often envolved with people.",4
40757,Really great course ! I have taked great lessons !,4
40758,"highly detailed insight, assignment makes it more interactive and thorough",4
40767,excellent tactics to influence people .,4
40770,I plan to utilize all of the advice provided in this course. Influencing people is a pri,4
40781,Good course.,4
40782,"First course I took with Coursera and University of Michigan. The content was well organized and easy to navigate, the presenters were exceptionally articulate, the resources were ideal for the assignments.",4
40783,Good course.,4
40785,Great information on the topic of influencing people.,4
40791,I'm looking for hight specialization about leading teams.This course is very effective and brings some aspects about leadership that can be immediately applicable to my daily activities. Really recommended.,4
40796,I found it very interesting and helpful for my personal and professional development,4
40797,"Most useful content is the list of factors that influence us behind the scenes in our minds. Would prefer to have more content of that nature presented, since the concepts of power and how to use those behind the scenes influences seem fairly basic in comparison. I appreciated the succinct presentation of the material, as well. Please make your graphics/slides available.",4
40803,very useful and handy course. recommended for all,4
40822,Useful knowledge,4
40824,It could have been better if notes/slides were provided,4
40825,"I wish i had te access to this course a little earlier in my life. It gives clear strategy and guidelines ""On How to Move across organization"". Awesome course for anybody who feels he is working hard work and is lost on how to navigate the complex organization situations... it acts like a torch light... However use it wit common sense...",4
40830,"Well done, but perhaps a little bit more depth required (foe somebody with 30 years of experience in large organisations).",4
40833,A very good course. Useful and applicable to one and all.,4
40835,Very useful insights and lea,4
40836,"This course provides a very good introduction to basic linear regression, including simple multiple linear regression, model building and interpretation, model diagnostics, and application in R.",4
40837,"It was a really good introduction to Linear Model, I recommend this course to all people who wants to learn more about statistical analysis",4
40842,"Good, but a little ""smaller"" than the Inferential statistics course (which is very complete). I would have liked to also learn Logistics regression, which I now have to learn elsewhere.",4
40844,"First, this course will enable me to understand the quantitative part of a research. Additionally, this will help a student to understand the essence of performing such numerical calculations and will make us understand the relationship between different variables.Secondly, this is the need of the hour and such numerical functions are used worldwide so, learning this course will help in almost every field be it 'Management' be it 'Social Sciences' or be it 'Human Behaviour'.",4
40846,"Good overview of regression modeling. Would have liked to see more on logistic regression. But that's ok, can read it on my own.",4
40850,"This course was good. However, compared to the other courses in the specialisation had less content. I would have liked to have videos on logistic regression as well.",4
40855,I learnt quite a bit. One of the most useful courses! I would suggest add more exercises in R.,4
40856,This course has provided me with a good and simple understanding on the concept,4
40858,"Compared to the Course 2 Statistic inference, this session seems to be a little be informal and rush. But still learn a lot from the conception of linear regression!",4
40859,"Great introduction to linear regression. Nice, clean R tutorials via the labs. The lectures do become a little monotonous, but there there are linked readings in a nice, open-source textbook if reading suits you better than listening.",4
40860,"Excellent Course. Mine, the teacher is a great great teacher. The mentors help a lot.Technical parts, coursera platform should work better",4
40869,This is a great course for this specialization but don't expect much depth.,4
40872,Great course. I only wish there was more time spent on dealing with more complex situations such as overfitting.,4
40877,"An extremely good introductory course. A must for undergraduates. The style of teaching is fluid and you learn concepts step by step. For more advanced learners the only drawback I see is that this is, by default, an introductory course.But still for advanced learners it can be a great (and I really mean great) refresher.",4
40881,"nice lecture, but it is really too short, not into too much details.",4
40883,"Still very good course with a lot to offer especially parts covering new methods. The only downside for me were the mathematical parts by Martin which got complex, messy and seemed to be explained not as clear as in previous course. Some ecological, more experiment related examples could be useful to help understand mathematical operations and formulas.",4
40885,"The course was ery good, I wish it also included working with sample fmri data.",4
40890,Course content sometimes too boring,4
40894,Thank you...,4
40900,Informative course with entertaining skits to deliver material.,4
40915,"I think this was a very interesting and informative course, although the lessons could have been a little bit longer! I do recommend this course strongly",4
40926,"A general introduction for people who have watched Kunqu yet also would like to know ""how to appreciate Kunqu"". The part that those masters presenting the acting, singing, etc. is always the best.",4
40944,"Very good introduction. In a light and friendly manner, we're given basics of game, I particularly remember balance, that I now keep in mind and look for in many aspects. I appreciated that no computer knowledge is needed, it's really about thinking what makes a good game. Comments from the peer reviews are helpful.",4
40946,"A nice course, with great content, but the Coursera plataform presented many flaws in key points, as the access to the feedbacks of peers...",4
40960,A very basic course to start off the game design career. Great if you want to start right from the ground stage and make your way up! Complex concepts broken down and put ever so simply! Try it out!,4
40962,Good Course to understand basics of Game designing,4
40964,There were a few problems with the app interface especially in the peer review section but a great introduction really enjoyed it.,4
40969,I'd give it a 5 if I was only rating the material- it was very informative and easily digestible. Just what you need for a starting course.The assignment and scoring part of the course is what brings the rating down a notch. Relying solely on feedback from people who are probably beginners in the field and who go by one sentence instruction on what to feedback on was not always constructive. More guidance needs to be added to what to look out for when scoring somebody's work.,4
40976,"Funny introduction to game design. Not too serious, which I think is what some people need to loosen up and start with a playful mindset. (See what I did there?)",4
40989,gives us the corefoundation of starting a career in game design,4
40996,"Great simple, yet useful, course to realize of the core things about Game Design.",4
41002,Really very interesting and helpful to me think own ideas,4
41003,This course is a very good intro course. The instructor Fran is both informative and funny. Fran really offers some great advice on how to think in terms of ways to develop and test your game in different ways. I thought it was certainly worth it and I think you would think the same too!,4
41007,"A good course, with the using of peer review as an instrument of continuous confrontation, but lacks support from the staff.",4
41019,Interesting tips on some important points when designing a game,4
41027,Good. It could be better with more videos,4
41030,"It's pretty fun and indeed teaches the basics of game creation, however I found a bit simple.",4
41036,"This course provides a nice insight into the gaming theory. Do not expect to make a dive into video game analysis. This game focuses on the fundamental ideas behind gaming, which includes all games. However, the assignments revolve around building board games, so you do not need to worry about not knowing any coding to make video games. Assignment criteria could use some polish, as the rubrics focus too much on mechanics (is it one page long?) rather than content elements. The delivery of the content is interesting. The instructor has gone to great lengths to bring in features that will help you focus better. There could be a better 100% integration between the material in the videos and the assignments, as sometimes you are asked to use only a tiny portion of 30 minutes of videos for the week, and that can make the videos less useful, or the assignment not as educational.",4
41038,"Simply give more literature, and some expert opinion about some interesting jobs of week.There is no communication at all",4
41039,"The module is overall great and gave me an intro on how game documents are developed, plus it made me start thinking like a game designer (I hope!)My only complaint is that the homework is fairly restrictive (only one-page game per week, which means there's only so much you can do) but I do appreciate the fact that it simplifies things and if anything, it pushes you to be even more creative, beyond the typical ""board game"".",4
41040,"The course material is funny and easy to follow, it breaks down important aspects of game design into easy chunks and assignments. As for reviews I feel like you get back what put in, if you make the effort for someone else you will get in return.",4
41043,Clear and simple. Suitable for beginners.But most of the contents are rather too intuitive.,4
41048,"The lecture is interesting, I enjoy a lot. And the assignment makes me learn a lot.",4
41051,Really good introduction to game design and to the rest of the courses.It does not have five stars because the task could be felt as repetitive if you started with a more developed idea from week 1.,4
41053,Great basics for games!,4
41077,"Even if it is a really simple course, I found it interesting and fun, even the homework were really funny to do. Much better than the second one.I just say that pricing is too high for a course that actually put 1/2 basic concept for each video.",4
41084,"good course, really an introduction =)But the teacher is always reading a ""Teleprompter"".He is not spontaneous... Except when He uses RPG to demonstrate an example ;-)But the content is great",4
41086,"This course is an excellent introduction into the world of game design. Fran Krause's teaching style is both engaging and fun. While the lectures are really short, and there's not really a whole lot of material, I found that I learned well through the doing the projects.My only criticisms are that this course is a little too easy and a little too short. A good game increases it's difficulty as the levels progress. If you don't increase the difficulty, you take away from the reward. The same can be said about a good course.",4
41088,Really fun,4
41096,"good enough for beginners,and the puppet is funny.",4
41099,Very good course overall. Would recommend to every game developer and game designer.,4
41100,"Simple, clean course that focuses beautifully on the core of what is being taught.Also very enjoyable vibe to the instructor and the assignments; there's a puppet as a TA... enough said. :)",4
41103,"Very good course, though it is an introduction, I feel as though I already knew most of the subjects that were explained, however I did not know the impact that those could have on a game's value and how it helps the player engage in the game. The course was simple to follow and helped me know what to focus on when starting a game.",4
41114,Good course with good concepts but could do with a lot more depth. This course's content would be one week of content for other courses,4
41115,"Good course, I enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of hands-on work rather than just lectures, however, there could be more of the latter aswell. Quizes would be nice too.The quality of the course is very high. Thank you for this course. :)",4
41117,"lectures are quite simple and short, but i really enjoyed working on homeworks! it's a great and short course to start generating game ideas!",4
41120,Good course! Can use more concepts,4
41121,"Instructor was fun, but a little stiff. It's his first time teaching, so I can forgive it though. The work was a little tedious. I wish there was more variety in the assignments than just updating the same game.",4
41134,"The course was fun and the progression through the weeks assignments was good. The contents were presented in a interesting way and were pertinent, but i would know a little more deeper.",4
41136,"I really enjoyed this course! The videos were fun and informational, the assignments were enjoyable, and reviewing other student work was helpful. I also liked hearing from my fellow students and their ideas about my work and improvements I could make.I would give the course five stars except for one thing - there was no one from the university to interact with. No one answered our questions on the forums, so questions went unanswered, ambiguities remained, and some issues grew as we progressed. Someone, even just a grad student or two, needs to be involved with the course in my opinion.",4
41138,"The instructor is a good story teller, teaching important skills from smalls tips which are useful.",4
41144,Good course!,4
41155,Course that do not require lots of time but put your creative mind on work and push it truly far making a simple game detailing before its workframe.,4
41156,"I liked the fact that the course starts from and covers the very basics. The videos were fun to watch and the course taught a lot through the assignments. With very less time commitment , the course taught me to make my first board game.",4
41161,Very good! The idea of delivering a work per week helped me develop the discipline and the creativity.,4
41163,"This course was interesting. It's truly an introduction to the field. I've actually read about Game Design in my spare time and it was nice to remember some of the concepts I've seen. It's all positive and good but I'd have liked to see the assignments handled a bit differently. It just felt too much one way, especially with one page rule. I do understand this is done to keep people organized and not going crazy with their ideas because since it's peer reviewed it should be fair. Also, once your game idea from an earlier week didn't have much room to introduce the aspect presented in the current week you feel kind of stuck. Although assignments mention we should build on previous weeks' games there is also mention to building a new game too. That part could be clarified or the nature of the exercise can be much more varied than one page requirement.",4
41171,"There's only peer review in this course, which didn't provide the evaluation on your actually level on design skill. It's really just a 4 weeks intro, super easy to achieve the full marks.",4
41172,"I'M LEARNING,ENJOYING THIS COURSE.LECTURE IS SO GOOD.ASSIGNMENTS ARE EAST AND CHALLENGING.",4
41180,"A course with very clear, fun lectures. My only complaint is that I wish it had been a bit more detailed / complex.",4
41185,"Starting third week now, and I'm sold on learning by doing.The classes are great, very easy to maintain focus because of how much variety Fran Krause brings to his lectures.The best part, in my opinion, is going through the games of other people out there because of so many diverse ideas they bring to the table.",4
41192,nice approach...,4
41196,A fun course with a good instructor. it introduces a simple process for brainstorming ideas.,4
41198,I like what I viewed so far. It is great to learn the fundamentals of game design without having to worry about learning a programming language.,4
41201,"Simple and fun method of education. short length videos, kind instructor and fun assignments.i have learned some basics in game world. i like this course and thanks to coursera,calARTS,Fran and his cool puppet friend :)",4
41205,"The course was quite helpful. I've been trying to make games already, but never knew where to start designing the game. Unfortunately it's quite short which was disappointing. I would never pay 80$ for a couple hours of video with basics",4
41208,"This programme offers a great introduction and background to the thinking on the Green economy, as well as very useful examples from Scandinavia.",4
41231,"An interesting course by the lecturers, supplemented with real life cases/interviews. Will like to learn more about the strategies for outreach and public policy. Overall, ver",4
41237,"A nice introductory course on greening the economy. I wish it would go a bit deeper in some issues.The difficulty level was for me, just too easy. Maybe I was not the target group after all, since I have previous knowledge in the subject.Nevertheless, for someone who is new to the subject, this is a very well strucutred and easy to follow course.",4
41238,Interesting. Would like to see more focus on national policies.,4
41249,A lot of examples and really good lectures.,4
41254,"Interesting concepts, interesting way of presenting them and the peer-assignement is a great way to discover knew things while review our classmates.",4
41258,"Excellent course, very interesting. Lots of different lecturers that address different aspects of climate change and sustainable development. This course is great for those who want to gain a broad introductory understanding of sustainable development with specific regard to individuals, businesses and cities. The only downside for me is that the lectures remain quite abstract, and even though many examples are mentioned, the course doesn't give you specific tools or very detailed knowledge or solutions.",4
41263,A great gathering of like minded people sharing great local developments in the Greening global economy.,4
41272,Not giving 5 stars only because it was fast paced. With a low grasping power i had to watch the video again and again. Otherwise the content in the video is to the point.,4
41275,Too fast.,4
41276,"I enjoyed this course. Being new to stats, I feel I needed more practice and extra examples. A lot of extra work and self-study helped me grasp and pass this course.",4
41277,"Awesome however was a littler dificult to follow, I think it can be betther by a step by step practices...",4
41281,Very good course to learn bases of statistics. I enjoyned. Thak you to the teachers.,4
41282,"Great course, not easy because lots of information is shared in a short time. But totally worth it!",4
41294,A good introduction with very good videos and exercises. I'm only not giving 5 stars due to the relative lack of clarity in the final week and the lack of feedback on the final exam.,4
41300,I struggled doing the exercises,4
41301,Good course for new programmer. Enough exercise for basic programming though isn't what I am looking for.,4
41311,Very good videos .. assignments were tough and few were confusing especially in strings .. I was challenged and got through the quiz with 100% which was satisfying,4
41316,The course is well prepared and paced. It's a problem based learning course. It will teach you how to target various range of problems appropriately. Some lessons and exercises however needed longer time frame.,4
41317,better course than edx,4
41318,It is the best course for the beginners who want to learn java differently.,4
41320,relatively easy but still excellent for the beginner!,4
41321,A little difficult for beginners! But awesome problems in the excercises.,4
41322,i found this course interesting. but in this you need to explain more clearly.,4
41326,They make programming look so easy! Enjoyed the course! Thank you!,4
41327,"I really enjoyed the coursework for this class. In particular, I loved how challenging some of the assignments were. However, I do hate that I cannot submit final quiz answers without paying for the course. I also did not like how little help there seemed to be offered to some individuals on the forum regarding issues they were facing with their code (specifically with the GeneFinder project).I took three of the courses from Michigan on working with Python and they were completely open to complete without payment (which means you opt not to get a verified certificate). I wish that this course, and the specialization that it is part of, fell into the same category.",4
41330,Great course but be prepared for a pretty hefty workload.,4
41332,Very cool but you need to focus and use the grey stuff.... harder than Neurobiology 1 & 2,4
41333,Incredibly comprehensive learning package which makes learning and skills acquisition easier. Kudos to the creators and instructors,4
41334,"All in all, this was a tough course, and the programming increased progressively as one moved on. Week 1 was OK, but I experienced a temporary hiccup in week 2 in the reading of the codon files; until I converted them to Strings. Even then the first file which contained only one DNA string gave its fair share of problems. In general, the section on Strings was pretty comprehensive. The programming was also pretty challenging. The section on debugging was OK, but I am at this stage still a little confused as to the amount and detail of information one is supposed to supply to someone else when you are experiencing a problem with your code. With the week 2 quiz I made a mistake than came back to haunt me in week 4; I did not read the question properly and from the outset my cgRatio method was not producing the correct answer. Eventually, after reading the specs for cgRatio again, I realised my mistake, could correct my code and get through the week 2 quiz! Week 3 on parsing, reading CSV files etc, the going was pretty good and I managed to complete the work covered in this section without too many problems. Week 4 on baby names; well, yes the mini Project was pretty extensive, with a lot of Methods being asked for and written. I found the small test files to be invaluable during testing. But the quiz contained a few curved balls. Method totalBirths does just that, and although in the specification it does say that it should also print the number of girls and boys names, and the total names in the file. Q1 and 2 tripped me up, I did not read them properly, and entered the total number of births for the girls and boys respectively. Questions 9 to 12 also resulted me in having to call a temporary halt, and write an additional method that looped over all the files from 1880 to 2014 in order to get the answers to those questions. Fortunately, method getRank came to the rescue here, doing all of the hard work!This was a lot of work! I did ""week 4"" in one week, but only because I was already on leave and could focus on the mini project for the entire week. The entire course took me 6-7 weeks to complete.I learned a lot. It was a good course, and very challenging. My greatest concern with the format you are using (80% or you don't move on - or you don't qualify), is that one can become ""unstuck"" as I did in week 2, but managed to get past that one.",4
41341,I liked the fact that the final tests need your code.... so if you do not understand what you have done you will fail :-),4
41346,more or lesss... :( I don't want to pay for pass my quiz,4
41348,very good course.,4
41368,"In the assignment of week2 , the Algorithm was not made clear.",4
41374,This Course's content was so clear and so enlightening! I really appreciate these instructors strategy! so different!,4
41378,"I liked the Course, it developed my skills of thinking as a coder, but I did not like the BlueJ programming environment, as I think it required to many clicks to accomplish simple debugging tasks and didn't have user friendly interface.",4
41386,"Might seem a bit overwhelming to beginners, but at the same time, a useful course to practice writing code on real-life data sets, for experienced learners.The library used here is useful, but not reusable in general.Overall, a nice experience. :)",4
41387,Very practical and useful knowledge!Thanks for your time and effort.,4
41388,"Except for a few problems regarding the clearness of some of the homeworks' statements, hence the stars, this is an excellent beginner's course for anyone interested in Java. I am currently taking the follow up course ""Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data"" and for the moment it seems as good as this one, although with the same few problems.",4
41397,Good course and quite unique approach... could have been more interesting and fun! Video presentation is too geeky at times.,4
41400,The homework is too time consuming.,4
41403,"Great opportunity to learn java and put it into use to solve the real world problems. But it's a little hard for people who haven't learned java at all, but only learned C#.(object-oriented programming).",4
41405,its a excellent teaching awsome faculty.,4
41407,use my analytical skills with this course.,4
41408,Great course and delivery!If only there would be more help in the forums by assistants or tutors it would have gotten a 5 star,4
41412,"The course itself is Ok, but I would suggest two things:",4
41420,"Love the course structure, very simple. Teachers start with simple concepts and eventually solve real life problems, which sound very complex otherwise.",4
41421,It is a good course for starters.,4
41430,"In general a well made course. However, I do not yet see the advantage of using BlueJ over e.g. Eclipse, as most people won't work with BlueJ after the course",4
41439,"A good intro into Java. As this is Part 2 of the Specialization, I would have liked to have seen a greater introduction into more of Java's collections than just String manipulation and CSV using an apache lib.",4
41442,Can be a little bit to hard for beginners but great and interesting assignments.,4
41453,"Interesting, but some assignments needs to be double checked. In my opinion some of the presented material is teaching poor coding practices for the sake of simplicity.",4
41457,"Good course, it seemed too easy at times since they provided alot of guides to solving the programming problems but I might be biased since I have some programming background. Overall I would recommend for beginners interested in learning java.",4
41465,"Thank you for the course, the only improvement i could think of is to improve contents for non English speaking people. E.g. You say decimal places, we say numbers after comma.Thank you!",4
41469,"As usual the 4 professors(presenters) have done an excellent job. The resources, videos, assignments and quizzes are very helpful, well thought out and comprehensive. They have done an enormous amount of work.But there seem to be problems with the import edu.duke.* due to installation problems (e.g. Windows 10).Maybe include 3 videos like:( example from other Coursera courses e.g. R Programming)Installing BlueJ on a MacInstalling BlueJ on WindowsInstalling Bluej on (Mac) ; including these would enable me to give a rating of 5 stars.For the beginner programmer this would help a lot.I know there is the Discussions forum (very helpful) and students must sweat a bit to get BlueJ to work on some messy Operating Systems but this is my comment as a Beta Tester",4
41471,Very good course taking into consideration the first week,4
41472,"Great course! One sugestão I have is to teaching how to use FileResource,URLResource, DirectoryResource, Pixel, ImageResource, etc, without using the edu.duke, because in the real word we don’t use this library. I know this library can facilitate the coding, but when the students use another IDE, they will not can do the same coding as they used on course.",4
41474,Very helpful and eye opening for the entrepreneur. It will give you the tolos to assess if your idea is viable or not.,4
41476,"Excellent course supported by lots of didactics of the teacher, as well as an adequate content.I found some videos a little lengthy, making the content a little annoying.Perhaps extending the course for 6 weeks with lighter content would make the experience more enjoyable.",4
41487,Please improve the sound quality. Thanks for this great effort.,4
41498,Content is good and teaching material is of good quality. Some more examples of the application of the concepts discussed during the lectures could make this course even more interesting.,4
41500,Very good course,4
41506,exceptionally well designed course.,4
41511,Very good insight for potential entrepreneurs!,4
41513,Very good information but the videos could be a bit more exciting.,4
41516,"Good Content, and a lot of knowledge its highly recommended to read the opportunity analysis canvas book before watching the videos. the Audio in many Videos is mono not stereo",4
41524,Very high level - I found,4
41526,"I wish there were more examples of successful startups and videos of live lectures with students. That really keeps interacted. Technology of entrepreneurship can't be taught but it can be shared as experience and knowledge. So, I would like to have more real examples and less theory. I'll give it a try in the next course.",4
41528,An interesting course with good information and interesting lectures. Guest speakers is also a positive thing for the course,4
41531,I found this course to be very enlightening and eye opening in regards to developing innovative ideas. The instructor helps you to realize that one of the keys to a successful entrepreneurial venture is being innovative. The course also helped me to realize that careful planning and analysis of where opportunities may lye and how you execute your plan to capitalize on the opportunities that you find all play important roles in entrepreneurship.,4
41539,"Very interesting, especially for beginners who are becoming interested on the business world and entrepreneurship, as the concepts are pretty basic, easy to understand.",4
41569,"Great look at fatigue failure. Looking forward to Parts II, III, etc",4
41570,"A good introductory course to gain an appreciation of some of the theory and techniques that goes into designing mechanical systems in our modern world. Real world cases are discussed, and I have become aware of some of the failure mechanisms in airplanes and in the body skeleton, so I am a bit more leary of taking airplane flights , and not jumping off high places while twirling. You need to be familiar with basic theory of stress and strain before taking this course, there is a series of courses available on Coursea as pre-requisite. The way the quizzes are scheduled makes it advantageous to watch the videos early in the week and take the quiz as soon as possible, since you get only one attempt every 24 hours. Enjoyed the course.",4
41582,"I really enjoyed the course through the 12 weeks, but I think the slides could have some diagrams/drawings to show the concepts when ""Dr T"" Chamillard is giving the lecture. This way, understand the concepts would be a lot eassier, specially for the people who is starting in the development world",4
41595,It is great start for begginers in game dev. But there is lack of materials for self-learning and additional organized theory.,4
41610,"This course gives a good introduction to programming and computer graphics. It's well structured and well taught. Since I can already program in C#, I was hoping there would be less emphasis on learning to program and more emphasis on the graphics side. I would also prefer it if the platform for the graphics was the latest technology most commonly used by industry and I'm not sure Monogame is it. However, the lecturer was brilliant and it's a course you can enjoy doing!",4
41612,When i started this course i had already been studying java programming for a few months. This course was incredibly useful at helping me get up to scratch in C# very quickly as well as get the feel of visual studio. Even with no programming experience this course could probably have the same effect.,4
41613,Way too basic. Questionable sence of humor.,4
41627,"The course was very good at teaching some of the basics of game programming, but the course description should mention that some Trigonometry/Geometry knowledge would be helpful at times. Additionally, I'd like to see the course extended to include the remaining chapters of the book that is recommended. The additional information would be beneficial.",4
41634,"At the beginning is quiet simple.. But if you miss something, and I'll be honest, in the forum you don't get so much help, you'll need to wait to the Instructor to reply you because he is the only who can put the ""answer"" or at least, the help you need.Aside this... This course is great! it teaches you every thing you need to know (at least the basics) for start programming in C#",4
41640,"Very simple introduction to C# and Monogame.Learn to create basic 2D games with sound and animation.Does not cover 3D, AI, Shaders, Networking or any ""advanced"" topics.",4
41649,"A great course for introducing programmers to games programming. I would have awarded 5 stars, but felt some of the material might be have been covered in more detail for absolute beginners. Personally I didn't have any problems with the course, but I could imagine beginners struggling on some sections.However, there is an excellent community forum that has friendly people helping out (including myself!) so I'm sure everyone that had problems could find the solutions or ask for help.Good fun and you get to create a ""game"" during the course!Thanks Dr. T - you did good =)",4
41668,Good introduction to C# and a nice gentle introduction to the XNA/MonoGame framework. It's lots of hard work for beginners for but seasoned C# programmers might be better off just learning MonoGame on their own.,4
41674,"The course is very good, but I was missing a piece of installation and configuration of mono and XNA in Visual Studio 2015 Community",4
41677,"This guy is great! He teaches very well, explains it really effectively. 4/5 for you, Sir.",4
41688,Very hands-on assignments with wireframing & mock-ups being the main focus,4
41691,Assignments were good practice but otherwise lectures were very thin.,4
41695,enjoyed doing the wireframes!,4
41704,"While i really liked these assignments some of the assignment briefs could use some flushing out and more details would help. Also this course could benifit from a mentor. Another thought more up-to-date visual examples, and reading materials.",4
41713,"I've learned a few things, because I've already designed a responsive website, but it should be very good for newcomers. I'll definitely change my own approach to design, as he showed - it's good to design mobile-first, but going back and forth multiple devices to show information more clearly is even better.",4
41718,"Lite compared to the other courses in the Specialization, but provides an interesting perspective on different platform wireframes",4
41719,Too short !,4
41721,"Great course. Easy to understand and build on concepts, but the Week 2 and 3 assignments were very similar. Might want to do something different there.",4
41723,The course is very good.,4
41724,This course let's you gain experience designing for different screen sizes. It's very useful because you feel the needs and difficulties of showing the right information according to the available space.,4
41726,"I expected to see much more about ""Information"" Design, in a sense of Design of Comunication, Design of the Data, Theory of Comunication and how can you remove ambiguity from a design (visual, industrial, content or what ever design it is).Still ok, but I expected better than wireframes and mockups which we already learned a while back.Nice roadmap although.",4
41734,"Pacing of this course was all over.Interface and Abstract classes were introduced and the material and lessons were easy to follow. Sorting using bubble sort, caparable, and comparator operators were also easy to follow. The final week presented topics on exception and try/catch/finally, but provided no practical programs for a student to write to ensure the topics were understood.The problem was in week 3. N-Grams meant to teach some very important concepts about Markov and predictive text, but failed somewhat since the quizes were not clear and the grading a bit harsh. In the quizes, problems were presented and you either had the right output or you did not. There was no checks available that allowed a student to figure out why code produced the wrong output. In other modules (and courses in this series), input was provided and expected out based on the input was provided to verify code was working correctly. Not in section 3 - you wrote the code, took the quiz, and if you got the answer wrong were left scratching your head as to why, since there were really no means to check.Don't mistake this feedback as saying the course was bad - it was actually quite good. If the course material for week 3 is updated to include clearer instructions and some better checks to ensure code is working correctly then I will change my review from a four star (it's more 3.5 than 4) to a five star.",4
41743,"Good examples -- good basic instruction in videos, but most of the value is in working the exercises which use some fairly interesting real world scenarios. And some of the direction is as vague as specs you might encounter as well.",4
41765,The homework is too time consuming.,4
41766,"the course material is really interesting , but it seems to be a little bit hard .",4
41767,"i liked everything except some of the quizzes since some questions were unclear or wrong (but still, I was a beta tester, so all great) - thank you!",4
41784,The only downside of this course is absence of certificate. Everything else is extremely great.,4
41789,Suggest to have more interactive Slides than lengthy Readings,4
41791,easy,4
41794,"Excellent course with good content, very pragmatic and sizeable",4
41800,An excellent course incorporating every element of the new digital world,4
41807,Легкий и интересный курс. Спасибо! Easy for understanding and interesting course. Thanks!,4
41809,I really like the content of this course and the quality of the readings. The videos are intuitive and help you go through the most important concepts. I definitely recommend it! And big thank you to the teachers that delivered high standard course!,4
41816,"This is a rather pleasant course with a mix of advantages and disadvantages. For me, the advantages outweigh the negative sides. It slides on the surface of things, though, so don't expect to get too much 'in the know' after it.What I liked (and you might too)-> Short, visually engaging, clear in their purpose videos-> Interesting recommended/required literature/video content to solidify the concepts presented in the videos-> Comfortable layout of the transcripts so you can DL them and check them out as PDFs-> The course is focused on a very interesting, dynamic topic -- and lives up with a dynamic, fun and engaging approachWhat I didn't like that much-> Quizzes had some rather easy questions and as a whole weren't that serious. You can retake them -- you need to rely on your honesty to assess how much you've learned.-> The brisk nature of the videos is nice, but sometimes the narrative would jump from one point to another too abruptly.I still recommend the course for those who want to get their feet a little bit wet when it comes to innovation, digital affairs and basic entrepreneurship concepts.",4
41817,good course for realizing the innovations in digital world,4
41819,Obtain awareness and concepts in a short time. Learned a lot !,4
41823,"So far it has been really cool journey through this course. Lectures are concise, practical and further readings are well selected and offer a broad source of knowledge.",4
41827,Great introduction into digital marketing.,4
41839,A good perspective. The videos were well done.,4
41853,nice presentations and interacting pretty well i had learned and enjoyed,4
41854,"The course does a great job of curating very relevant videos and articles to understand digital from a 360 degree perspective. While all of us are exposed to digital from a consumer perspective, looking at it from an entrepreneur's and investors' perspectives completed the picture in my head. I liked the short video format, it is engaging and easier to schedule into our lives. Some of the readings were called ""not mandatory"" but were needed for answering the quiz! I would request not to have really long readings - some of them were very intensive papers written as part of an academic exercise and I will be surprised if any of the students, who are looking for many small and engaging materials would be interested in tackling really long non-man",4
41866,"Great Course, loved the content.",4
41873,Short but very informative!,4
41874,"I really liked the videos with Dan and Norman. Great to hear from real people what we read on the books, some times it feels unreal, but when you see a real person telling you something is more credible.",4
41880,"There could have been more content and the course been more challenging, otherwise loved it!",4
41883,THE COURSE IS VERY GOOD.,4
41886,"Really interesting subject, presented in an entertaining way!",4
41888,Great interviews inside the course content!,4
41892,It is a little incomplete and leaves a lot of gaps in your knowledge. It is pretty basic and works as a fast introduction to Macroeconomics.,4
41894,Not as interactive and engaging as many other courses on the website but still very informative and easy-to-follow. I took this with little to none knowledge on economics and I manage to go through and got interested in further study the subject.,4
41901,"Good overview for law beginners, interesting lectures and useful tips.The downsides are the peer-review system of grading (sometimes you get a bad grade and there is no explanation why) and the fact that the links to recommended and mandatory literature are not working.",4
41902,Enjoyed Prof. Ayres' lectures and the readings. Definite,4
41922,GREAT COURSE,4
41925,"The course presents interesting topics about law in a concise way and invites reflection. My background in law was quite limited and even though I struggled to understand everything the first week, I now comprehend the principles of common law and have the right tools to approach legal decisions. Doing this course has been a very enriching experience for me because not only have I learned more about key concepts in law, but I have also improved my way of writing and summarizing information.",4
41926,"Fascinating. A lot of depth, with so much supplementary reading you get out what you put in, but it felt rushed and with so many unassessed topics some seemed inconsequential. I would have preferred it to have been spread out over another week with a couple extra assessments overall.",4
41942,"Simple and well explained, but perhaps more information should be put on slides behind the lecturer.",4
41943,Very good course.,4
41950,"Since this course handles difficult context, it may be little bit hard to one who studies law first time.",4
41957,Excellent and fun class to understand Common-Law concepts and be prepared to with US Law cases.,4
41958,It seems very interesting.,4
41959,i really did enjoy this course but it was very stressful terms of timing.,4
41962,"This was a very good intro course.Some additions that could be applied may include: describing different types of motions (interrogatives, cross motions); types of judgments (proscriptions, summary judgments, enjoinment), types of memoranda, or even a FOIA request.Maybe a look into work product privilege, protected documentation, principles of discovery. And finally, a little intro into the art of using case law as an event or test, for example; in ""Miranda"", ""Keller"", ""Brown"", or the ""McDonnell Douglas test"".I understand this is just an intro, but if these things could be fit in somehow that would be cool.",4
41964,"Okay class. Could deal more with terminology, how to break down a case to read it and obtain information. How to's of it all. From getting the case on my desk, breaking into segments, how to make a claim and finding laws to support it. What is a theory versus what is a developed idea.Thanks!",4
41972,"I found the range of topics extremely helpful and relevant. There were some minor technical problems with regards to grading, but overall, I really enjoyed the learning experience from this particular course.",4
41973,The course was beneficial to me and I learned a lot of new things. I took one star because of the assessment of students who are too poorly evaluated.,4
41975,"it is great for citizens students, However, the speaker uses such a little hard vocabulary to understand for international students as me. I really enjoy in this course. Thanks.",4
41982,"Very good course. The instructor was very good and clearly was engaged in the subject. Some material was duplicated in different modules, but overall I found this course valuable.",4
41986,"Good engagement with students. Much better than some of the other courses in this specialization. Video could be a bit shorter, though!",4
41993,Great course.. Highly recommend to learn about care giver landscape and vocabulary. I especially enjoyed the CEO assignments.,4
42011,very practical and vocational course. I reccomend it!,4
42015,"Thoroughly enjoyable and interesting course, with clear instructional videos and materials. Highly recommended.",4
42023,Great info and advice.,4
42024,"It's a very instructive course. Within 6 days, I turned from not knowing anything about Adobe Illustrator to become very fond of it.One caveat, though: Adobe Illustrator CC free license only allows you a 7-day of free use (not 1 month as mentioned in the lecture), so you'd better be able to do all the projects within those 7 days if you want to use it for free.",4
42029,This is a nice practical course.,4
42032,Clear and pragmatic.,4
42038,"Great course and great teacher. The lectures are quick, easy to understand but nevertheless interesting. The time schedule is tough, but you can easily switch to the next session to have more time. The only aspect that I would change is the technical level of (some of) the lectures: sometimes they are even too easy, and a lot of time is used to explain very basic stuff. Maybe some 'optional' lectures might be added on",4
42042,"Good course, explaining basics on infographic.",4
42054,"I did learn a lot in this course, especially for me that I am very new on this topic. It has been challenging enough for me. Some recommendations for improvements.1) Adjust the estimated time to complete the assignments. It took me a lot more than the estimates to complete them.2) The grading system especially on the final assignment is too difficult. You need to be EXCELLENT to pass and this is difficult to achieve in a subjective peer review rating.3) I did not expect to be responsible of providing grades for classmates. It is not clear if the university offering the course will provide feedback. Feedback from the experts is what I expected when I bought the certificate.4) I had to do my final assignment on a different software as my free trial subscription for Adobe Illustrator expired.Overall, it was a productive course for me and I did learn from it.",4
42059,Exellent course. I rearned a lot about infographics and now I'm doing my own infographics. Thanks,4
42071,An absolutely amazing experience and a good learning. Karl Gude has been a good facilitator and a very good expert in sharing his experience may it be practical or knowledge sharing.,4
42075,"I had to keep pausing the videos because he kept rushing through the material. The notes that appeared on the sides were very hopeful, but rarely stayed on the screen long enough for me to write down the first note! It was very informative and interesting.I WOULD recommend this to someone else, however I really wish that the notes stayed on the screen either as he talks (until he gets to a new topic. EX. Egypt VS. Babylon- the whole topic of Egypt VS. Babylon the notes for it are on the side of the screen. When it gets to the next topic-- say Neo-Babylonians, the notes for that topic appear ), or just long enough for people to read the notes and copy them down.",4
42077,Excellent combination of materiel from archaeological studies and the Bible. gives a much clearer understanding of how the identity of the Jewish people came about.,4
42091,It is one of the latest programming language,4
42092,"The audio volume throughout the videos should be improved; consistently, my ears were bombarded during the first shot(s), but as soon as the side-shot plus code came into view I had to crank up the volume in order to understand what was said.Otherwise, it was a very well thought-out and enjoyable class, thanks!",4
42133,"The intro leads you into some really great games and programs. The main downside is that some of the coding projects seem like ""fill in the blank"" exercises rather than programming on your own. For a real beginner though its exciting getting those cool games out there.",4
42145,"This was a nice closure to the specialization, but a little too complicated to the point where there were almost no students around to get feedback from or give to.",4
42146,The best couse content I had. Very thoughtful and professionally developed.,4
42148,great content and good course for an IT technician !,4
42157,This is a great course: very insightful and delves deeply into different levels of who is included in the Talent Pipeline! A great expanded view. The only thing I would change is the filming of YouTube videos (,4
42159,"I love the course content, and especially peer review assignments. I have one negative feedback for Cheri Alexander course contents for number of things:1- Too much repetition.2- Very vague examples were used. More practical & complete examples should be included. Moving talent across different departments does not happen often, so this can be replaced with some good example.Thanks,Adnan",4
42166,"I found this course useful theoretically overall, but to me in terms of practicality only ""managing performance evaluation and feedback"" was useful.",4
42167,"I loved this course, with the slight exception of the video uploading part, It is not bad, but if coursera implemented the videos on to their website then the student interaction would be better.I had never come across the talent pipeline concept and it is definitely a very interesting one, will definitely be applying a lot of these concepts at the office.",4
42173,Really good course about the do's and don'ts of the day to day management of a team.,4
42187,I was especially encouraged by my progress in this course,4
42190,"Good course, really enjoyed it!!! A lot of tips and very complete process, before recruiting, recruiting, selecting, onboarding and developing talent.",4
42191,"Great course, great content. If I were allowed to do the quizzes without paying, I would have completed the course and most likely gotten the certificate. I can't commit to a course and pay for it before I experience it.",4
42192,"Overall another great learning opportunity. Appreciate the relevant models and templates to aid in identifying and coaching top talent. 4 stars as there are some opportunities to improve the delivery of the first lesson and I am not a fan of video tape assignments. That said, would highly recommend - the course learnings are incredibly relevant and will support you in making a difference in the work lives and careers of your team.",4
42193,"Overall nice course, a must one for team leaders.",4
42199,clear and ussefu,4
42207,Interesting and educative course. Recommended for every management staff.,4
42208,"I found the content of the course very interesting, I really enjoyed the interventions of Jeff Brodsky and Rich Sheridan. What I would have liked, is to make the content more landed to reality. I didn't understand some examples from Cheri Alexander (for example the video of the skaters getting the gold medal)",4
42215,I find it really informative and practical.,4
42219,"I really loved it so much as it gives a very accurate information that can not be acquired through theoritical practice, but through practical one.",4
42221,I'll have to re-listen to the videos before the course locks. I expect to use a lot of the tips provided in this course to retain talent and to dev,4
42225,"Very interesting topic and great classes, but it might be a bit hard to apply the skills to your life if you are not inside that management world.",4
42230,"the language was a little fast for me and i tried to follow by the subtitles..the peer view is frustrating .. some we'll have hard time understanding the ideas, some will write in their mother language..so have technical jobs and talking about it like another )???) word..also, in the same task, some people will give high rate and the same question others will give 0.. it's frustrating as it affect the mark",4
42240,"You can tell there was a lot of work put into this course. I think there were cultural differences for me (this course was french) in the way of teaching that I didn't enjoy. It's great course, but too vague and confusing for me. I tend to like simple logical steps and to learn the core of a concept, the vague stuff for me comes into play when you're dealing with humans in the real word, but I want clarity in my learning before I deal with humans. This one never got to the point so I didn't continue on to the next one. Could be great course for others, just not me.",4
42241,A very informative and interseting,4
42244,I found the course to be very relevant. Something that I believe can be applied at work and/or in personal life..,4
42245,"It was very nice and rejuvenating. Conversation exercise was bit challenging. Overall, it enabled to refresh certain aspects while enabling learning new ones.",4
42256,Very good journey,4
42261,"Good structure. Interactive. And right example. However some comments : Valerie uses a lot the word to focus and ignore the potential of the diffuse mode of the brain to enhance creativity. And also Valery, really, I don't care about what shirt you are wearing.",4
42262,"I like this course. It is simple and easy to understand. I would say it is an ""easy-going"" type of course. The Conversation ,one of the most important exercises , was hard to do because my partner did not have a good knowledge of english. I did not enjoy it much. I think in this type of course where you need to collaborate with others it necessary to test their level of english beforehand so that none has trouble with that. I just wish it was more informative and with more examples. Lack of good examples or situations is the reason why I give this course only 4 stars. But the professor was great and inspirational.Thanks for this course.",4
42265,Gave me a good outlook of the path to inspirational leadership.,4
42270,Excellent start for the leadership course !,4
42271,"Excellent course, I learnt so much about myself and about improving my Relationship to",4
42272,"Great course, I would definitely recommend. Information flowed smoothly and it was a great way for me to learn and understand my leadership style. The only reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5 is because during the peer assessment I kept being matched to persons who were in a different time zone from me which made it difficult for us to communicate. Other than that 1 glitch, thoroughly enjoyed the course.",4
42277,I am fascinated at the approach of this course.,4
42283,Really good course,4
42286,Out standing,4
42289,"I really enjoyed this MOOC, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to build or strenghten his/her leadership skills. The content of this mooc is really rich, and Valerie and her guest make it quite easy to learn.",4
42297,"I liked the course, particularly the interactive part with peers. On the negative side, I find that the price of ~80 USD for the enrollment getting a certificate is a little bit too high for the 3 weeks online course. I think 30 or 40 for each course in the specialization would be a more reasonable price point.",4
42311,Great Course on the leadership behavior,4
42312,"a little too slow, and a bit superficial on the difficult pieces. I would recommend to spend a little more time on the fundamentals, and a little less on the anecdotes.",4
42322,"Excellent course! I am continuing with the specialization and seeing the benefits in how I relate to my direct reports already. This is the personal management style I have been looking to develop, and what a great way to develop it by developing me. Thank you.",4
42323,The interactive aspects of this course are what set it above and beyond other leadership experiences.,4
42328,"It is conceptual compared to other courses, however it brings a lot in increasing our self-awareness. Very much appreciated.",4
42332,I realy liked this course! Some parts were already known but there were some very interesting new things. Especially the conversation helped me a lot!,4

42359,Really great course! Do it for yourself,4
42379,"some of the lectures are very informative, inspiring, have content that I didn't see in other entrepreneur courses provided by other institutions, these lecturers concerning are great. but some are disappointing. the lecturers just not very enthusiastic and profressional. the sound effect of videos is a little bit poor. hope the next course will be better.",4
42382,An excellent course. There were surprising insights in almost every class. I also enjoyed the practical mindset displayed by the staff and course materials.,4
42383,I learned many things new for my start-up.,4
42384,"Valuable insights, definitely a recommended launch pad.",4
42386,Good only for technology type entrepreneurship,4
42390,"In some lessons, teachers appear to be nervous so it's important to pay attention to that. Although the course is interesting, I expected more tools to be innovative and to create ways to join the marketplace.",4
42392,"Pretty good perspective, but geared towards app-based businesses. Not certain how the recommendations in this course relates to biotech start-ups.",4
42412,I'll have to wait for the english version. Great material but my chinese is basic.,4
42416,"Solid contents, also required solid graduate level mathematics. The instructor may consider providing more details in some of the derivations. It is a bit difficult to follow during some lectures.",4
42424,THANK YOU!,4
42428,"clear and easy to understand,",4
42432,Thank you,4
42434,"Good, informative and precise. Thank you Prof. Doug Thomas.",4
42438,"Interesting, but quite repetitive and theoretical",4
42445,It was a very good overview of the aspects of Management of Urban Infrastructures.,4
42448,Course was very nice but you could have added details about other infrastructures. I was expecting information about other infrastructure will be in week five but in week 5 there was only exam.,4
42455,"Great course to understand the different aspects of urban infrastructure namely, energy and transport. It talks about various actors playing the role of managers and operators and the challenges faced by them. A good course overall.",4
42460,I learned a lot about Urban Management. I already loved the topic and during the course I liked to see what I studied in my city. I will write the final exam statement about the study of my city as soon as I can. Thank to the professor and to the EPFL for the course.,4
42461,Course is very good waiting for next in the series.,4
42463,"Very interesting course, that covers the broad fundamentals of Urban Infrastructures. I liked how the content was made relevant by case-studies and quizzes that focus on your city.",4
42469,"This is a great introductory course which lets anyone learn the layers, management styles and agreements that all have to work together in order to provide an effective and concise Infrastructure model.",4
42474,Excellent short introduction to the topic.,4
42483,Excellent course material both educational and useful.,4
42490,Great course. It inspires me to encourage my students to reflect on their learning process.,4
42497,"Very interesting course, which has helped me be more cognizant of how I'm processing things. It also confirmed some beliefs I have about how my mind works (which is just like everyone else's!).",4
42501,very useful.,4
42515,"Good paced, with very interesting material. Learned both new ideas and also understood older ideas that i didn't quite have a good explanation for. Thanks for a great course.",4
42521,Great and useful techniques to apply in your daily learning process. Also good insights about how does the brain work (including in procrastination states),4
42528,This would be a great course for someone towards the end of school or attending college/university. There is definitely valuable insight to be gained but it feels a little slowly paced.,4
42541,Youl get some very powerfull tools for studying.,4
42547,"Nice introductory course to learning, which fills an important gap in education. I would have personally liked a little more rigour to the assignments and material, but the current level is, I suppose, targeted to participants of all kinds, which is fair.",4
42552,It's a good material.,4
42594,This course gave me fundamental definitions about how our brain works. Highly recommendation for everyone from all background.,4
42613,Good course for learning about how our bran works but the curriculum is slow-paced.,4
42620,"i learnd to much from this course, i learnd new things that i do not know before, it changed my studying way , and opend my eyes and brain to learn more about learning, thank you",4
42627,"Before starting to learn everything, suggests to take this course first to ensure how we can learn better.",4
42639,Very helpful and interesting. I would like some more techniques like the Pomodoro to be presented during the course. It would also be very helpfull to have the most important topics written in a list after every video-course.,4
42643,"This course is done so well, that it is itself easy to learn. I would recommend this course to any high school or university student.Unfortunately, most of the advice is not very useful for someone who spends 8 hours at work and has two children at home :-) This course does not have people that are juggling work & life & study in mind.But if you are a full-time student, do not hesitate!",4
42647,I was extremely happy with this course. I have learnt much which I will share with others. A big thank you to Ms. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!,4
42649,"Great course, still remember some tips and tricks about learning even after more than a year since the course ended.",4
42652,Thank You,4
42653,I liked this course. It gave me new ways on understanding learning process and how to improve learning,4
42667,"The teachers are really good and the information given is helpful. However the lessons are a little short, they could go deeper in the topics.",4
42678,"This course was brilliant on the whole! The videos and interviews were good, although it could have gone into more depth into how we use our brains to harness the concepts and our thinking to come up with solutions to unfamiliar situations. This has revolutionized the way I learn, and given me a fresh perspective into how the human brain works.",4
42681,More Exciting course,4
42688,"A lot of useful and practical advices and information about learning. Definitely worth the time you'll put in it. Really enjoyed some of the tips applied in the video (powerful pictures used like zombie, mental palace etc) Some of the technical/bio video should use more of that model to explain the concept. Not sure I can quote properly any of the scientific concept that was explained.",4
42691,"A nice little course which I felt has changed my perspective on how to be an effective learner. Certainly, I will be experimenting with the techniques in the course in my own learning.",4
42693,Very informative course. I'd recommend anyone to take it. I did feel like the later modules were not as interesting as the earlier ones but that's just my opinion. Some might find them really helpful. Regardless this course has changed how I learn now and in the future. Thanks guys!,4
42728,what most important I learned from this course is; actually two things...1 changing your thoughts will change your life2 you have not learned something unless you can teach it to others.many thanks...,4
42732,I have learnt some useful techniques on how to learn effectively. Thank you.,4
42743,Thank you.,4
42749,"The concepts and techniques in this course are very helpful, and I appreciate that multiple approaches and techniques are shared - learning isn't a ""one size fits all"" situation and I found that, while some of the techniques suggested have not worked well for me in the past, other techniques from the course have really opened up my understanding of my own learning process.My only complaint about the course is the quality of the videos. I'd love to see the course updated with less errors and sound drop-outs from the recordings. Perhaps one of the students who has benefited from this course, and also has video editing skills, could help out!",4
42751,A very helpful course about learning and brain functioning,4
42769,"I truly enjoyed the lectures and the material and I hope it will help me whilst trying to learn new things, subjects, more deeply in the future.I found the tests a bit too easy though - patterns can be recognised, helping us with the answer -- creating the illusion of competence :)I want to learn more and more deeply on this subject and some aspects of it - memory and so on, from a scientific perspective -- maybe the course could dig deeper, or I might just look for more info elsewhere.Thank you to both Professors and the team of people involved.",4
42803,Informative with lots of additional resources.,4
42830,"Very useful information. I would have liked a bit more scientific information about how learning takes place, but this class did a good job of teaching me some ways to learn more effectively and to avoid procrastination.",4
42835,"I enjoyed the course, and I found the material to be useful and relevant for future use by just about everybody at some point in their lifetimes.",4
42843,"Have many interesting aspects for teachers too understand, especially on how focus and defused mode of the brain works, and how to use it effectively in your lectures . only thing i think there is missing is a bit more theory about the serotonin, Dopamine and Acetylcholine. so it's not only primal function mentioned , but also how it interaction with the brain itself.",4
42903,"Not bad overall. Some very useful tools, although I confess I found a lot of the delivery to be very dry...sorry! Best of all is the ongoing weekly email which continues to throw up new sources of info. Many thanks.",4
42924,good information really. i have learned a lot. keep going :D,4
42931,"In today's rapidly changing society, in order not to be left out, it is of utmost importance to practise lifelong learning. This course is extremely useful and timing given the global changes. It provided me with useful information and helpful tips for making my learning more effective. I believe that if I practise the tips shared in this course, I would be able to learn effectively, for life.The course was presented in an interesting and easy-to-understand manner. The pace was a tad slow for me as I am only taking two MOOCs. But I find that this pace would be just great if you were taking many MOOCs or if you were not a native speaker of English.I highly recommend this course to anyone who would like to supercharge their learning.",4
42935,The tests are a little too easy.,4
42938,"What struck me the most was the fact that some of the concepts that are taught in this course are things a lot of people are already doing on a subconscious level. It really helped me look at things like this from a different perspective.While you could argue that some of the examples and metaphors that are used by Dr. Oakley are a tad childish for older students, they get the point across very well.The book pretty much covers the course material and in that sense, I don't consider it a necessary purchase. Having said that, it helps to read through it to help you solidify the things that are taught in this course.Thank you to everyone that helped for these life long lessons and sparking my interest in neuroscience!",4

43233,"Thank you so much for making this course, It really helpful to learn and also easy to follow so I think the early you learn this the better you are when you have to learn something new and especially is you are a student :)Hope you enjoy the course like I do :)Thank our teacher so much again for making learning how to learn",4
43234,"4/5 finished it in under 1 week but it could be faster, maybe have an alternative where you dont repeat yourself that much ? The resources, Optional Further Readings and Optional Interviews ARE A MUST !Dont forget to put it on 1.5x speed ;) ;) ;)",4
43246,This course was very valuable to me but it will be more effective if there is a project at the end of the course where every one try to apply what he have learned in the course,4
43249,This course aggregates a lot of best practices how to learn better. Barb goes in deep explanations how our brains are working on both high and low levels. Seems like fall of the course mostly targeted for sturends,4

43312,It's good to understand the way our brain works when we're learning and how to turn it.,4

43480,Clearly presented and easy to understand. Very helpful.,4
43489,It could have much better design.,4
43506,5 stars if the audio from the videos would remain at a consistent level and also would be amplified a bit more as i often have it maxed out and still have trouble hearing much of the vid content. The content itself is priceless imo. Really excellent tools that you'll use the rest of your life.,4
43507,Thank you for this course and we wait an other course of this kind :),4

43580,Very good course,4
43589,A lovely course. Well explained and funny.Thank you for sharing your knowledge profesor!,4
43603,"This is a great course for those who study not for not studying. Shows many good and practising methods for being better learner and improving yourself psychologically. Sometimes it is better be psychologically efficiented than educationally. I graded 4 from five only because of this is not mathematical course. Nevertheless I am appreciated team who made this course. Thank you, and good luck ;) :)",4
43608,"I really enjoyed this course. Barbara Oakley was brilliant and explains things very clearly. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, however, was incredibly difficult to listen to. His speech didn't flow and that made it hard to follow what he was saying.",4
43612,very helpful and entertaining!,4
43655,Quite interesting overview of how our brains process data and creates information and collect memories.,4
43706,Very helpful for my graduate studies in Molecular Medicine! Thank you!,4

43814,"it is a very useful course, i really enjoyed it :)",4
43837,"Really loved this class! I am a pre-med student and when I took this course I was studying for my MCAT exam. There are so many aspects to this course that cross over to the psychology section on the exam, however I do think that the most valuable information in this course is the practical application of how to specifically refine and improve my focus in learning and my personal study sessions. Dr. Barbara Oakley is definitely",4
43848,"Interesting course that not only teaches some good learning strategies but also discusses the neurology of learning. Very useful and although I wasn't thrilled with the presenters, they did a good job. What made the course particularly interesting were the bonus interviews with various people who had accomplished some pretty incredible learning feats. I learned quite a lot from this module and I am glad I took it.",4

43863,"This course is very helpful for people looking for a way to learn more efficiently. That being said, I feel that many students might not grasp that fact because they feel that they know already much of what is said. I honestly don't know how you could improve that without putting some thought into it. I hope this helpsand thank you.",4
43890,Intresting and inspiring,4
43906,"Good,practical, insightful and usable. Challenges some old methods and points to more effective ones. Would have liked more intensity, action points and tools to have given it a 5 star rating.",4
43908,I completely liked it and i hope to get use of it all my life,4
43913,This has given me much insight into learning. I am using what I learned in my studies and am grateful for having the opportunity to have done this course. Thank you.,4
43920,"Very interesting, Open new point of view for more exploring.",4
43921,"The lectures made me reevaluate what I considered ""studying"" and explained how I can trick my brain in to being more efficient at taking in information. The last week contains some good test taking advice and motivation. Highly recommend this class!",4
43931,"Exciting course for people , who want to know how they can learn more effectively.",4
43940,"The course was really good and it helped me to get some new learning techniques and ideas. At first when we had to do this course for school I was like: 'This isn't going to be any helpfull at all'. But then while I was learning how to learn, I discovered some great techniques and helpfull tips! So I recommend this course to anybody who wants to get better and more efficient at learning.",4
43945,"Very good cause, easy to follow... most of all. the concepts are very practical and can apply immeidatly.",4

43973,One should take this course in order to overcome the fear of learning any difficult skill or subject.It provides very helpful information pertaining to our common learning patterns and mistakes we do in studying.,4
43974,Short but informative,4
43979,"Overall, I thought this course was designed well, and did a good job of communicating serious information while staying mostly light. I think the professors could use a little more experience presenting this sort of thing, as some of the videos were kind of awkward, but this is a new style of teaching so I don't really fault them. I would recommend this course to most people who have an interest in how the human brain works.",4
43990,"It's a helpful lesson, I'll use it in my life. Thanks!",4
43997,Excellent and important for everyone to know,4
44006,Only the background isn't pretty enough,4
44036,Fantastic! Very well spoken.,4
44037,"Although this course seems to be focused mainly on students, I found many of the concepts taught very relevant to me (as a working professional) as well. The theory is explained with humor and insight - Barbara is a pleasure to listen to and watch. She obviously enjoys teaching this course very much.",4
44040,Open your mind to broad your mind!,4
44045,"This course covers some interesting topics and may very well help you better understand what you already know. For me, it was a bit slow to start but gets better as the lessons progress. It solidifies some ideas and methodologies that you may not have been to sure about when going about your own studies and learning new things. I would recommend this course to everyone, unless you really aren't learning new things every so often.",4
44049,Great information and easy to understand.,4
44068,Very helpful for shaping learning strategies to get the most out of the time spent studying.,4
44075,"An essential primer before starting MOOC. Developing the right attitude and understanding how to learn, has undone years of bad habits and perception that it's not possible to learn difficult subjects. And yet, Within 3 months of taking this course, I have dabbed in Game theory, Big Data, Psychology at work and other diverse courses. The sessions are informative, not only on the theoretical aspect of learning, but also the physical aspects of the brain that help us learn. The tips and techniques I learned have helped to create regular habits and practices for learning, learning broadly, building the blocks for more in-depth learning.",4
44089,"To be honest in my review I would have to say that I learned a few key idea from this course (such as the distinction between focused and diffuse mode, emphasizing the importance of exercise, and a few others), while I had already realized and applied some of the things by myself (and were happy to see them confirmed here).I can completely understand why the course has been simplified to an extreme degree. This makes it easy to understand for almost everybody and is more inviting for all people to continue learning with the course and benefit from it (and it is clear the course is aimed at everyone). But I felt sometimes the oversimplification came at the cost of more needed detail.",4
44096,It's useful for life and job.,4
44099,Entertaining course and very easy to follow.,4
44103,Its an awesome course it really helps you a lot to impure your tough subjects and to sharpen your mind. Thanks a lot for this wonderful course and I must say the lectures were so good your so good barbara...,4

44111,It was very helpful and insightful.,4
44114,"Very good course, lot of interesting ideas.",4
44115,"I like Learning How to Learn because it has so many good ways to develop and maximize your learning on so many different levels. Keep learning, Barb!",4
44120,Great course!!!! It was an excellent introduction on how to correctly use our brain resources in order to learn more effectively.,4
44123,It was really good but I think needs better video quality.,4
44148,"Amazing! I wish I've taken this course earlier, so I truly recommend it to everyone out there.",4

44175,"I really enjoyed this course, it has helped me how best to manage my studying techniques. Thank you",4
44185,"Barely anything you don't already know or do subconsciously. But the little that you don't know, will help you understand and remember new concepts more effectively.",4
44200,"Having doubts about being able to study and retain information is what brought me to this course. It was one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I've ever had. Barbara Oakley has an authentic, non judging style and clarity of communication I can aspire to. The quizzes were fun and tough enough to check that I actually did listen and read the content. Highly recommended if you have any doubts about your ability to learn or want tips for studying. The last star not awarded is only because I think it could do with an update or Mach II :) Thank you for this course.",4
44206,This is very good course and I specifically liked the Pomodora technique ..Great to have this course and looking for more ....,4
44217,"More structure is needed, although the very advices are good.",4
44221,"Many handy tools to add to your mental library, and solid intake of neurological knowledge as well. 4/5 because I hoped that even broader spectrum of techniques would be shown, and pacing of the course was personally a little too slow.",4
44225,"This was a very interesting class. The principles covered were helpful and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning how to learn. As I went through it my recurring thought was ""Why didn't they teach me these concepts in middle school?""",4
44234,"It was a great learning experience.After this course, you'll approach your learning with a different state of mind, you'll hopefully be able to master the mental skills you have, and definitely shape your personal tailored way of learning.",4
44235,"Straight to the point, the only issue is that some lessons has some audio problems but only a minor ones.",4
44237,very good comprehensive class. i have been studying about memory & learning for sometime and was pleasantly surprised when almost all topics i had came across was under this single class.,4
44238,I really enjoyed taking this course. I hope it remains online so I can review it later. Thanks,4
44245,I like how the course was supplied with anecdotes because it makes it easier to apply the lesson. Please make the interviews more organized.,4
44249,Interesting course for all those who are interesting in Learning how our brain and memory is working!,4
44256,"Enjoyable course, good pointers to learn. For me, it was a good break from studying hard, getting a little mental pause, while learning to learn.",4
44262,The content of this course was great. The videos were a little odd at first (could be a cultural thing) and a portion of the content was obviosly scripted and felt a little more robotic but I got used to that pretty quickly. The information aligned with previous study but also brought a lot of new techniques and information.,4
44265,"Excellent Course , Great Faculty and Amazing tips for learning .Its for every person whose aim is to learn what ever might be his age or the subject he wants to learn.One of the Essential life skill Learning how to learn.Thanks to every person who made this MOOC Possible. :)",4
44301,"This course's material is useful. I knew many of things which are pointed here, so there was almost nothing new here. Also, I always was an ace student, so.. maybe this course just wasn't impressive enough for 5 stars.However, it featured many, many tiny tips and tricks, which, if mastered, can vastly improve learning trough the whole life, save time and become more efficient. Great, huh?This course's main material will give you direction and basic, most important tips, which you will remember. However, there are many more nuance things, which may require additional research (memory palace technique, for example).I recommend this course for everybody, because it, obviously, will benefit everybody who's determined enough to go through this course and take learning tips into practice.",4
44302,"Loved the learning tips and tricks, the teachers however had many under developed on camera skills. (or there were bad mics for one of the teachers)",4
44306,Learn some of the powerful mental tools to help you grasp tough subjects,4
44307,"learning how to learn is very useful and powerful mental tools that helped me to understand the best way of learning. thanks for coursera.org and university of california, san diego",4
44330,Outstanding way to understand our cognitive function! Some obvious stuff but still worthwhile.,4
44339,Excellent course. Gave me many new ideas to learn better.,4
44348,"I learned some very helpful and practical tips and tricks during this course to improve my studying (at university). Moreover, the tips and tricks given here are supported by scientific (neurological) research. Learning how these tips and tricks work and whý they work made me want to try them out.",4
44364,"Thank you, excelence course and excellence instructors",4
44372,A great course that I have learnt. Let's learn and practice what you learnt. It would be wonderful!,4
44375,Thank you. Your team did a wonderful job. I am greatly appreciative.,4
44391,"Good course, however the questions in the quizes are the same as in the learning quizzes, this feels a bit too easy.",4
44402,Very helpful. I've learned a lot.,4
44435,"A very helpful course for anyone to take. The learning environment is relaxed and positive, but some of the test questions seem like giveaways from time to time.",4
44449,"Lots of interesting facts about learning, inspiring experiences from guest speakers, and some useful tips to be enhance your learning.",4
44451,"I have learnt some useful tips about how to learn, and have a deeper understanding of our brains.",4
44476,It definitely gave me insight on what works best when it comes to learning. I use a lot of the information now and I realize that I spend much less time studying while at the same time learning more than I would have before.,4
44481,"brain washing project, nice",4
44495,"Overall very good material. It sometimes became a bit too childish for my liking with octopusses & zombies running around the screen, but otherwise nice and concise ideas and good structure. Could also have been nice with a bit more depth in the scientific explanations.",4
44496,Very good tips!! I really recommend it.,4
44501,Very intersting course,4
44547,"great course to get the fundamental idea, tips, advice of how to improve your learning process",4
44552,It is interesting and useful for my life and work.,4
44556,"Useful course for learning, although some tips are quite obvious. It is useful to know how the brain works and what you can do for a better learning experience.",4
44562,I think the course offered some wonderful advice but more examples could have been given. The guest lecture interviews were incredible!,4
44566,interesting and simple tricks that can apply to everyday life,4
44574,"Very good course. Effective for learning and remembering new concepts, tackling blocks to learning such as procrastination.",4
44577,"The materials provided are great and easy to grasp , optional interviews are great source for learners.",4
44582,"On the positive side, I enjoyed taking the course. It is well suited for high school and first year college students, and I think that the mechanics of the course are well presented.That said, I also feel that the course could be re-structured to remove the emphasis on being a student, and concentrate on the principles of how to learn effectively, that anyone, of any age, would use. as a mature adult, I found the last week's content less informative and almost disengaging .",4
44585,I am very excited. Great methodology.,4
44587,Very good course! it's make me improve my learning. Thanks.,4
44609,Very effective in presenting new information that I can use on a daily basis. Awesome and powerful if applied properly.,4
44610,"As a developer of E-learning Courses , this one should be a role model.",4
44620,"One of the more invaluable courses available online, and its free. Information, tips and tricks contained in this course will definitely help seekers of learning effectively absorb new knowledge they're trying to acquire.",4
44626,I liked the format of the course and I found most of the interviews very interesting,4
44661,good course to motivate yourself to learn new and tough stuff,4
44664,Very usefull. A transversal skill that we all need,4
44672,Practical and useful tips. It made my study routine more productive.,4
44677,The material was presented in a way that was easy to follow. I am anxious to put this stuff to work :),4
44690,Good tips that can help when learning new things/subjects/skills.,4
44709,"Very good course, would highly recommend to anyone trying to learn any subject. All the information given applies to anything you would want to study not just math and science. Includes great tips and advice, would highly recommend reading the book ""A Mind for Numbers"" as well, it does a great job reinforcing the material. Lectures on the structure of the brain seem a bit forced and almost out of place though I did see the relevance. They were not integrated very well into the overall course in my opinion.",4
44712,it is a buatiful course with excelents teachers,4
44718,good info but missing exercises,4
44734,"Good content, pleasant professors.",4
44759,Interesting course !),4
44762,very interesting and informative course.,4
44768,"Good course on how one could improve one studying. It emphasizes a lot on the 'no pain, no gain' mentality. Many techniques are mentioned and are very helpful. Some may find this to be a bit redundant since you may already been doing lots of the things they are talking about in the video. Nevertheless, it is a very interesting course. Would recommend the book by Dr.Oakley since it is a lot more detailed.",4
44779,"Read Dr. Oakley;s book ""A Mind for Numbers."" Tooks this course's quizzes to test my recall on the book's material. Passed without viewing any of the lectures. Well worth it.",4
44806,first mooc for me - it got me to the end with pleasure. And I think it motivated me to continue learning and try those presented concepts or continue using them when I was allready using them before.,4
44811,"I decided not to submit any exercises but I did really like the presentation, the faculty and the information. Would recommend. Thank you!",4
44813,"I am not a native english speaker so please excuse the following.Every student should, at some early point of his cursus, learn this.It could avoid you some very frustrating failures along the way.At the very least, it will help you understand the setbacks as you come to face them.",4
44823,Good overall. I had been utilizing these techniques without knowing it.I think would be good to summarize everything in a page or two long PDF pretty easily.,4
44841,"Well laid out, easy to follow, and actually has you using the techniques while learning.",4
44847,"Overall great course, lots of tips and tricks to get better at learning stuff.Despite this, there are some pitfalls to this course:Volume of some lectures is too low.Male lecturer reads all his lectures, seems stiff, unnatural.Sometimes language is to ""academic"" for regular people to understand.",4
44849,"It does help me a lot, great module!",4
44854,"Learning How to Learn is an excellent course for people who want to learn better, especially students.The materials covered in this course are interesting, and the instructors are able to present them with analogies that help me understand them easier. While the knowledge and advice given by the instructors may not apply to everybody, there are sources that link to research concerning them at the end of each video, so you can easily check their credibility yourself.The best thing about this course for me is the amount of extra reading and interviews provided. They not only extend what I learn from this course, but also help build the bigger picture of what I learned and how I can implement them in real life.",4
44859,"Very enjoyable, pretty useful and very clear (understandable). Thanks to Learning How to Learn team!",4
44866,"solid, quick course with good study reminders",4
44870,Mandatory course for every student out there.,4
44873,An excellent course giving many useful tips for studying.,4
44914,A very interesting course! Recommend to all of you!,4
44917,Great practical advice and easily understood lessons make this a course that everyone should take since learning how to learn is,4
44918,Very interesting topics. I bought the Barbara Oakley book and still I'm still reading to fix the subjects that I studied in this course.,4
44928,"A very good course. I enjoyed listening to some of the key ideas such as concentrating on process Vs product and focused Vs Diffuse modes.Thanks a ton for getting this on Coursera!Great Job by the team at University of California, San Diego.",4
44955,very helpful and motivating,4
44959,"A very interesting course, with the material given in a simple and clear way for everyone to understand.",4
44973,"This was my first course I did on coursera. I very much enjoyed it. Even if you think you've already got your learning nailed down, you will pick up little things of this course that will help you learn even more efficiently. You could decide your on pass because all the material was online which was very pleasant. The MOOCs were very clear, and the little quizes at the end of the videos gave you direct feedback if you understood the discussed material of the video.",4
44982,Some very interesting insights and good analogies,4
44997,"I thought this course would be too difficult for me but the method and clarity of explanations gave me more and more confidence and taught me how to better deal with all the information on the course. The biology videos had to be watched and transcript read and subtitled but overall it was a great and illuminating experience. I re-trained 6 years ago to become a teacher of English and my trainer said I would never have the same relationship with the language again. She was right. And I continue to learn from that fact, it's so much more complex and fascinating and the chunks keep growing! I feel the same way about this course - Learning will never be the same again! And it's a very positive rewarding gift. THANKS to the whole LHTL Team. Avril.",4
45003,Interesting and useful techniques that I'll definitely use in the future for my future personal learning. I now aim to read the book,4
45045,Good information. Very helpful. Could be more entertaining at some parts.,4
45048,"A very helpful course, done in a fun way.",4
45054,Good course but its too short.,4
45071,"Nice Course, Helps you understand the nuances of learning and some techniques that can help you avoid procrastination.. Thanks !",4
45072,very interesting,4
45074,Very helpful course for learning.,4
45086,It was a good course and helped me out of misconceptions i had about ways of learning and also helped to re-enforced some of my own belief systems. I specially liked the section on procrastination and how to handle the same. I will definitely try to imbibe some of the learning in my professional life and as far as possible will try to disseminate the learnings with others.,4
45087,"Great Course, the way that Barbara uses to explain is very understandable. Nice content, easy going course and effective.",4
45091,Very helpfull,4
45097,"Very interesting course with some practical tips on how to improve your learning process better. I wish I had done this code when I was in school or when I slogged during my grad school, but better late than never!",4
45098,interesting insight into brain processes related to learning,4
45133,"An amazing unique course, reinforcing the skills required to be effective at learning new material.",4
45150,"This is a very helpful course to improve your learning habits.This is one of the courses I wish I had done when I was a student. It is backed by solid research and is presented in an user-friendly way. It will drastically improve your ability to absorb and retain new material. The techniques, tips, quizzes, discussion forums, additional reading material, interviews are all very helpful. I enjoyed doing the course and looked forward to each week's session.My only reason for deducting a star is that occasionally they get carried away by the analogies and metaphors in order to explain a concept (a case in point is the module on chunking). And then you are left wondering how do you actually apply it to a real subject - the metaphor is very well done but the real-life example is something that was not clearly explained.That said it is an occasional issue and almost all of the course holds up well. You will find many counter-intuitive ideas (such as highlighting is not as effective as making notes in the margin; exercise and sleep actually help your brain) and useful techniques (such as deliberate practice, interleaving, pomodoro technique to beat procrastination, recalling, spaced repetition etc.) to help your learning.I think school children from 13-14 years upwards of age can grasp much of the course on their own. Younger students may at times may need help from their parents to understand a few of the concepts.",4
45162,Great course with easy to follow videos and information,4
45166,"Wonderful course, but quite hard to understand some English phrases in quizzes as for non-english speakers",4
45170,"Good course that gives cursory knowledge of some study tools. It's not a breakthrough, must-complete course by any means, and the material it handles isn't overly complex (given the abstracts it uses), but it does quite well and provides meaningful insights for students.",4
45181,"I was a bit dubious about the course to start with, and thought it might be too easy, too full of common sense, but in the second week I felt I was learning things, and boosting my ability to learn and focus, which is so important today. I'm considering further study to help me find interesting work, so this course has really helped to get me on the right track to study again, with a bit more confidence and method. Thank you!",4
45183,I would recommend everyone of my friends to take this course - irrespective of whether or not they want to learn a specific academic subject. It would be nice if school courses first teach this course as part of curriculum - which surely helps students to to know how to approach the different topics that they want to learn.,4
45190,"For me, some of the stuff was really helpful but some of the stuff I already knew of.",4
45194,"This class has helped me reignite my learning career to be a lifelong one. Barbara is a perfect professor for this class because she can empathize with students who may shy away from techinical subjects like mathematics and science. However, through this class and her book I've gained new learning techniques and, most importantly, a new confidence to pursue a career in the technology field.",4
45195,Very interesting topics with mesmerizing analogies that really helps you to understand and learn the concepts given by the course. Also great tips on how to improve in learning.,4
45196,I really feel I have learnt a lot from this course and I look forward to implementing some of their techniques. Dr Oakley was particularly good. I struggled with her somewhat soporific voice at the start of the course but once I realised how good the content was I managed to stay awake. I found Dr Senjowski somewhat harder to learn from.,4
45214,This course is good but I can't say it's perfect. The information given in this course is rather obvious to anyone who can use their common sense.,4
45216,"i love the course so much, that i recommend it to several of my family members and friends ...thanks for your great effort in this course",4
45223,"Very interesting course, with lots of very good tips and useful advice on how to improve learning, and also how to understand what is happening when learning a new thing. Its tips on procrastination are certain to help you make the most of your day.",4
45231,"Some of the course materials are useful to high-school students, not to people in life-time education (like, procrastination or test-taking stress). However, all other subjects was very useful, especially I would like thank the course team and personally Barbara for very interesting optional interviews with interesting people :)",4
45246,Good course. But not too many useful ways.,4
45260,"Insightful, entertaining, and relevant. I found this course to be all of these things. It gives me food for thought and will be very useful for any future courses I undertake. The relaxation methods and the study advice will prove invaluable.",4
45261,informative and interesting course!,4
45267,Awesome steps.Every lecture or ever word in this sessions are unblocking day to day problems.Thanks a lot,4
45274,It was helpful to learn a few hacks to make learning a little less painful. Thank you!,4
45277,A very practical course about learning. Maybe could offer more practical exercises.,4
45286,I wish there were application exercises,4
45317,"This is really a good course, through which I do learn a lot about how to study more effectively. And this course won't take too much time, so enroll right now！",4
45322,This course is very good,4
45323,It really helps when you need to pick up a tough new subjects after leaving school for some years.,4
45327,Great tips on how to improve the way you study,4
45337,excellent way to learn new techniques about your mind tricks and know how it works,4
45352,"it is awesome course ,, i benefit from it so much ,, and thank you for Arabic subtitles .",4
45367,The course was indeed an eye opener.It has enhance my approach to learning. I'll recommend everyone take this course.,4
45368,"This course was great. Lots of extra information for added learning, lots of review on all the concepts helps make them easier to remember.The only thing I didn't like is that many of the questions on the quizzes were repeated several times, and almost everyone question was had multiple answers.",4
45372,Out of a dozen courses I completed on Coursera this was one of the most challenging,4
45383,it helps me a lot,4
45398,Very simple and basic,4
45407,"Very interesting, really helps set all the ideas and things I knew in my head and just organized it and motivates me to get the important things done.Ironically enough I was procrastinating starting this course and as soon as I did it pushed me to go on",4
45418,Fantastic !! very helpful course !,4
45431,Great course to do begin your (re)learning journey. Teaches many useful techniques which can be put to use instantly. Happy learning!,4
45432,Useful bite-sized knowledge on improving study techniques.,4
45440,"The course is very good and useful for teaching students how to better learn and understand the material they are dealing with. One drawback, however, is that it focuses excessively on test-taking and methods of succeeding in an undergraduate degree rather than a career. It would be nice and interesting to show how the techniques being presented can also be useful outside of class. not just by examples related to great people in various scientific fields, but also by more general parallels. Otherwise, it is a very good course to help combat anxiety and procrastination.",4
45456,wonderful course! Thank You!,4
45486,Very Good!!,4
45507,Very fruitful course with many interesting new topics to apply in our everyday life.Thanks!,4
45513,Provides some excellent resources for those interested in deeper or more effective learning strategies.,4
45525,"I learned so much from this course. It was probably the first course where I actively and deliberately tried to follow steps of new information as I learned it. So very helpful and simple when broken down to digestible methods, techniques and language. Thank you professors for such a useful and interesting course! I will constantly review this information over and over again. ""Practice makes permanent.""",4
45536,"Great course, provinding great tools for learning! Thank you Barbara and Dr",4
45537,Outstanding experience and lots of new ideas and facts for my toolbox. Thanks for thinking of this course.,4
45550,"Very well done, it's inspiring !!!",4
45556,helps a lot,4
45566,"The information contained was very useful and immediately applicable. I felt sorry for the professors during the videos, as they looked very uncomfortable in front of the camera and was sometimes a bit difficult to listen to as they didn't seem to have comfort reading the teleprompter. The information of how our brains function in long term memory building and understanding procrastination in more of a neuro/chem response was greatly appreciated. Techniques provided were all immediately applicable and can easily be expounded upon. I am recommending this course to anyone intimidated by STEM. Also recommending for several girl scout troops. Thank you for the opportunity to audit this course and learn deeply from it.",4
45576,"This course was exactly as described, and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach. The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have, in my opinion, been set up s their own unit, instead of into others, which I found to make it harder to digest.My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end. I'm sure some learners like the term-project-like assignments (creating pdfs, videos, etc), but from a casual standpoint (ie, I'm not paying for a certificate for this course), I was just relieved to find them to be options -- ones I didn't exercise.But overall, those two annoyances would not keep me from taking another course from UC San Diego or the instructors behind the course.",4
45579,"Excellent course, very effective teachers, well designed material. Congratulations!",4
45590,Really nice informative course,4
45595,Very helpful in helping me to prepare for exams and generally remember and learn new things,4
45630,Very informative motivating. I like it.,4
45634,Perfect first lesson in Coursera,4
45658,"Simple techniques that came naturally to you as a school student have been conveyed in this course in a much more scientific and interesting manner.The instructor does a great job of keeping you addicted to the course.The techniques learned can be applied anywhere starting from your day to day activities to learning that skill that has long been on your bucket list.Don't think twice ... If you have trouble completing other courses, take this one. You ll finish this course and all subsequent courses you take up.Thanks to University of California for providing such a great course and Coursera for bringing it to us.",4
45669,"Really helpful in understanding how your brain works, and how you can get the best out of it.",4
45670,"A very great course, indeed. My sincere congratulations to all people who were able to make it. This is the best course have ever done.Millions of thanks!!!",4
45672,"This course was very interesting and provided lots of advice for studying and learning. I bought the companion book, ""A Mind for Numbers"", which I found pretty useful as a complement (though is not strictly necessary!). I recommend this course to anybody interested in how to learn effectively, but specially to students in college or university -- they are the ones who can gain the most out of it.",4
45677,"This course was tremendously helpful in providing powerful tools to fight procrastination, which is one of my biggest problems in learning. The course also provided interesting insight into the workings of the brain and how we learn. I now use what I learned in this course to realize when I am procrastinating, then employ the tools from the course to fight it.",4
45679,"This course is a lite and approachable collection of tips on how to work with your brain to learn more effectively. It won't blow your mind with advanced techniques you haven't heard before, but it is a nice succinct overview of what works better and what doesn't work so well. I picked up a few tips and had to sheepishly admit that I was guilty in the past of studying in a less than ideal way (I have a Bachelors degree). I would say this is a particularly useful course for young adults to take as it's not too heavy and is useful in explaining to them how to be more effective and why the techniques in the course work. That is not to say of course, that it is not useful for all ages.I found Barbara to be reasonably effective as a presenter. She speaks a little slowly for my taste, but I sped up the playback speed to 1.25 and that made it comfortable. Her lectures are well thought out and smoothly delivered.I found Terry Sejnowski contributed little to the course however. His explanations were fumbling, muddled and confusing. I found myself reading Wikipedia more often then not to get a better explanation on the concepts he was supposed to be teaching. He just didn't explain them well. He also didn't really explain why he was explaining them at all. The lecture on neurotransmitters was particularly bad. In what way did any of that help me learn how to learn? I think most of his lectures are just not that necessary to the course. I also think Barbara could have done a better job herself. But I understand her wanted to include him as he is an apparent authority in the area and it lends some credibility to her course.I think it's well worth taking and again I think this would be ideal for school kids (secondary) to help instill good practices early and steer them around a couple of easy to make mistakes.",4
45685,"Numerous good ideas for improving learning and retention, I also recommend the textbook.",4
45688,"I thought it was well thought out. However, I can't say that I agreed with all of the research and statements but I did learn from it. Thanks!",4
45703,It is the most useful class I have ever taken.The teacher were funny and the content were interesting.,4
45713,tell us about our-self...good course,4
45718,It is one of the best course that I have attended so far.,4
45728,Too focus on taking tests,4
45730,Useful in everyday life as in professional careerA very pedagogue and leading teacherA must see !,4
45742,"it's a very good course to help us to understand the way our brain works and how we can learn effectively and efficiently,thanks a lot !",4
45743,Useful programme with helpful insights in learning.,4
45753,"Summary: Overall this is a course worth taking. It gives you tips and tricks into how to learn backed by scientific evidence.I really liked the discussion of focused and diffused modes as well as how you're supposed to chunk things you're trying to learn int small bits to better understand it.The course covers also a bit of neuroscience and how learning really works in the brain. It was interesting to know that the working memory is very limited while the long term memory is basically unlimited so trying to remember too many things at once just doesn't work.The great thing is that the course provides a lot of supplementary material that you can delve deeper into if you want to know about something. One of the papers cited talked about 10 different learning techniques and it was a revelation to me that highlighting text is actually not efficient in learning.Overall the course was nice, I found the quizzes a bit too close to what was said in the lecture. It might have been better to get a reading assignment that delves deeper into something and then some questions on it.",4
45756,"Its amazing, and thanks to maths & English professors who used similar techniques when i was 14 which helped a lot in my further career.",4
45760,Great insights to improve the efficiency and efficacy of learning.,4
45764,Intresting and worthwhile course for all who want to be more efficient in learning and in work. The Course content about brain activity and tricks are helful and useful by easy way.,4
45770,"The pomodoro, the emphasis on 4 working memory slots and the supplemental videos with SMEs around memory palaces and focus learning were a big help.I also appreciated the focus on how to combat your zombies and work on procrastination were very helpful as well as the focus on the law on serendipity.I also liked the emphasis on testing yourself with questions and recall as a way of mastering the material.",4
45777,"This is an excellent course, both in terms of content and delivery, but also in terms of the generous amount of useful tools and tips that can be easily applied in our daily lives.",4
45778,thanks,4
45788,Just the technics without the science may be better for the general public to understand the course.,4
45792,helpful,4
45798,"Hi,It was quite basic but I enjoyed it and in the end it was full of useful info, thank you! :-)Take care!",4
45801,"That's a really nice subject. However, I think that the assignments should be theoretical essays",4
45805,It is a journey of one's own inner self as experienced throughout the years of compulsory education and later during the life-long studies. One gets to know oneself better and think about improvements s/he can make instantly. I downloaded the pomodoro timer to my Mac and realized it's time to fight the zombies who help in retaining my bad habits of losing time web-browsing or using too much of the precious will power for trying to start learning anything.I will definitely stick to studying the optional material as I have time having finished a project of my life at work. I will miss both Barbara and Terrence and their fun way of teaching.,4
45810,"it gives good imputs. However, it looks to me that it is directed more to science, math, engeneering students than students of social sciences.",4
45816,Lot of practical and new information on leaning techniques,4
45838,Great,4
45843,"I found the course helpful. As an older life long learner, I have had experience in identifying and modifying bad study habit. This course reinforced what I have picked up along the years. I applaud the clarity of the short segments of each lesson and think that this course would be extremely helpful for those of us with poor study habits.",4
45851,Great insights and make you think back about your assumptions and what you already learn to build a correct learning p,4
45855,"An amazing course to help debunk a lot of myth, provide you with a lot of simple and effective study tips.The videos, the instructors both are very amazing. I am happy I took this course and I hope it will benefit me in my future learning experiences.",4
45869,Really useful and enjoyable course that was well presented. It was a pity when it ended.,4
45874,"It was perfect, but informations could be passed more efficiently (informations may have more compacted form - videos would be shorter without missing any fact)",4
45882,"The course is quite helpful in shaping the way of thinking. By applying these ideas into practice, it would largely benefit an individual's future.",4
45888,I like it very much. It's fun and easy.,4
45898,"Just Great! Only bad point; to too extensive, examples and concepts were briefly described and left out areas which I thought was interesting. But on the whole, just great - I recommend everyone to take this course!",4
45912,Great course with lots of useful information. It helped me loosing few bad studying abits!,4
45929,"Interesting introduction, hope following courses will be better!",4
45947,Cons: Tests are too easy.Pros: Interesting stuff though.,4
45952,"This was a very instructive course, videos are very clear. I think that one thing that can be improved is practice, I would love to have more practice to get better all the concepts (altough I know that it is very difficult).",4
45956,A great course!,4
45966,EXCELLENT COURSE ABOUT IMPROVE LEARNING. I like Course put subtitles in Spanish language. Sometimes I can not understand all the American English and I check it in the subtitles.,4
46005,Learned some interesting new things. Felt the course was repetitive after the third lecture though.,4
46011,"Modules are easy to understand and logically taught, lecturers have an understanding of teaching and teaching material which in itself is necessary! Well spoken and articulate.",4
46031,"This is a thought provoking course giving a number of extremely useful insights on how to learn more effectively and become a better learner. I wish it had been longer, more extended and probably a bit more complex. Anyway, the knowledge given in the course has already proved to be helpful!",4
46036,"A lot of good advices and tips, but it could be better with deeper explanations.",4
46039,Good Course with excellent teachers and good advices.,4
46041,It's amazing course . I really enjoying it right now cause it has a lot of information and help me to realise what is the problem and it gives me tools to solve my problem and the common problem it that way .. so Thanks for learn how to learn team :D,4
46046,a good class and would love to recommend to my friends.,4
46050,A set of powerful tools for learners.,4
46059,Good course,4
46069,This course provided clear tips and reflective processes to make the learning process both more enjoyable and effective.,4
46071,It is a very good course that helps you to understand the philosphy of learning.I only give 4 out of 5 stars because what I was missing was more practical information about how to study. (Only few methods were introduced to help improve the study experience).,4
46080,Gave me a great understanding of how my memory works! Very helpful!,4
46107,"Great insight, loads of useful stuff here, now am trying to teach it to my kids, thank you",4
46108,"The first 3 weeks are very good , they focus on the learning process as expected . The last week is useless about learning , a bunch of test tips . It´s unnecessary , it should be kay as optional lessons , but as mandatory it´s really waste of time if you are just looking for the leaning tools.",4
46111,A lot of great information on learning. Remember learning is a process not a product!,4
46115,Please provide the certification is free. I am coming from developing country so we are not able to pay this much amount.Please make it free.,4
46128,"Some really great tips on how to learn effectively. Scientifically accurate and pitched at an appropriate level. That said, at times, it wasn't clear how to actually use the information in the course to improve one's learning. More practical examples would have helped with this.",4
46136,"Excellent course in understanding how our brain works in learning. It really provides some great knowledge that, if applied, can change your life to the better and improve your chances in success!",4
46142,"I enjoyed the course very much, it is actually one of the few which I finished. It provides a lot of helpful tips about effective studying. Lots of the material is presented in a metaphorical form which was also fun. Optional interviews are great, so do not miss the chance to view them! The course is both pretty scientific as it relies on scientific data about neuropsychological processes of the mind, but it is at the same time very easy to follow for those with no corresponding background. The only thing is that the tasks were not challenging enough for me, I would enjoy them more if they were little bit more difficult, a bit more brain-racking, though it is surely a very subjective personal impression. I would like to thank all the Learning How to Learn Team for a great course!!!",4
46143,"Helpful for me, an adult learner, to get back into the practice of studying.",4
46144,I really learned some important tips on learning to share with my high school students. I still am cloudy on some areas of terms in this course but it was my fault for not entering in discussions. It was the Christmas season and I really didn't have the time to do so. I did enjoy this one.,4
46151,very practical!! recommended,4
46155,Very interesting course,4
46156,"This course is short but might be interesting to many people because it gathers ideas about learning from many sources. Some of those ideas you might have heard of before, some ideas you might as well be already using intuitively, but stating them explicitly in a course gives them more validity to persevere in them.",4
46173,"I have taken study skills courses before and they were bring and dull. I thoroughly enjoyed the theory,science and presentation of this course. I learned many great new techniques, Thank you!",4
46188,"Excellent way to revisit/rethink what it is to learn and how best to go about it. While unquestionably a boon to students, as an adult (past middle age), I took away many important and unexpected tips, techniques, and perspectives. Although I personally had little direct use for the section on Testing, it was still interesting—and I certainly wish I'd known that material when I was a student. One thing I would have liked to have addressed is how to set up and use self-testing to assist with day-to-day, non-student procedures and learning situations. Both faculty members were engaging and inspired confidence.",4
46191,Excellent tips and methods for everyone not just those who find it difficult to study effectively.,4
46198,"This outstanding course is a good introduction on the learning of concepts that are needed to learn math and science. These do not come easily to me, so I very thankful that the instructors took time out of their lives to teach an adult student about how to learn these subjects.",4
46201,"I've been struggling with the learning process since high school. Over the years I've initially approached the chance to learn with enthusiasm and determination (""this time it will be different""), only to be derailed by unwavering perfectionism and the steadfast conviction that I can't possible live up to expectations (""if I'm not perfect, then it doesn't mean anything""). I've fled more often than not, taking a fail or missing an opportunity rather than face the possibility of being merely average, or worse. So taking Learning How to Learn was not just about understanding the process of learning from a tactical point of view, but showing that I could follow my goal all the way through to the end.Fortunately Learning How to Learn provides a very supportive environment in which to learn and, importantly, make mistakes, without the whole world come tumbling down. The purpose of the course is not to identify the good learners from the bad learners, but to provide everyone with the chance to learn in a non-competitive way. As someone who has feared learning for a long time, it was incredibly, monumentally important that Learning How to Learn be a place to enjoy the process of learning, rather than the outcome of it. And that's what the course provided.I'm going to be testing the ideas and strategies from Learning How to Learn over the next few months, leading up to the start of my second year at university. My goal is to focus on the process of learning, not the product (an important point from the course). It's my first small step in overcoming my fear.",4
46208,"It's very basic, but helpful and it give some easy insights in brain functioning.",4
46213,A great experience. Really helped me understand that age is not an issue just give in to your passion nd interests. Also how subjects like maths nd science could become easy and interesting but the techniques taught,4
46221,"Very interesting to know more about learning. Very simple and down to earth, don't expect a Master Degree level type of course. But good course for everybody curious and willing to improve their learning skills.",4
46230,"I came in with my own theories based on my experience only to find there is scientific backing almost everything I have been doing. An example would be dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test. Sure, the horror, or, that's ill advised. However, dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test allows my brain to go to diffuse mode. When I snap out of it or wake up I suddenly know the answer or how to go about reaching the solution. There has not been a single test I've taken where I took a nap and did not score within the top 5%.Everything I learned here will further augment what I know by experience but did not have scientific research to back up. Everything I learned will help me explain to others what it is I do to learn efficiently and how they can go about doing the same thing (maybe not falling asleep on a test ;P).This was very helpful, and includes loads of resources to read and or watch long after you are done to really solidify those chunks. Would recommend to anyone with the drive to learn deeper and better.",4
46235,Barbara Oakley has a very nice voice to listen to and she explains thiings very well. It is an addicting course which makes your more curious and willing to learn more and more!,4
46241,"It is a nice introduction, with important key points and good references for further reading. On a down side, it is kind of repetitive and in spite of the obvious enthusiasm of the speaker, sometimes the lectures are a bit boring.",4
46245,Great course only wish there were less problems logging in as I relearn new learning materials,4
46271,it's very good for me !,4
46273,Very useful and effective,4
46276,"It's not quite as in depth as I would've liked, but it still drastically shaped my studying patterns and has made me a much better student and learner.",4
46281,"Thank you for your advices, that's really helpful",4
46296,I feel better equipped with effective learning techniques and gained fundamental understanding of physiology supporting learning.,4
46314,Good course,4
46341,inspiring and helpful,4
46357,"I am just over half way of this course, but already convinced that this is the best introduction to MOOC's I could dream of. Not only is the subject clearly explained by Barbara Oakley and her team, the way your progress is measured and presented helps students to stay on track. I would have given five stars if the MOOC offered more formative tests and a wider variety of questions and assignments.",4
46365,why am not doing this ? I cannot get this i never well? when will i ever be able to remember ? you get the whys and how it happen . you get to understand alot about learning about yourself and the most important procrastination the number one reason you do't do anything you want to do .Fun and informative and your life will never be the same :),4
46366,An essential course that should be taken before enrolling or participating in any other study material.,4
46368,"Loved this course, I learnt a lot how my thought process and memory works and I am now more organized and relaxed when faced with a problem I'm bumping into : I just do something else, knowing my brain is still working out in the background and will eventually come back with something ;-)Thank you Barb !",4
46381,Nice course. It provides a general review of neuroscience discoveries about learning.,4
46383,really helpful for everyone (even for the best students) so that people understand what they do right and how to get better,4
46417,"Very useful. Not only trick, but explanation and good pattern to develop one's skills.",4
46419,Very simple and to the point-- I found the info on procrastination most helpful. Wish there had been more of the neuroscience information that was briefly provided in the male professor's lectures.,4
46437,I rated this course at a four-star because of the high informational content included. I really enjoyed it and was intrigued by the tips and facts in this course. Thank you very much.,4
46439,"I love the content of the course, I would like to see the teacher Oakley more happy about herself, she does a tremendous work and she does not project that.",4
46446,"Some useful points, however I wish they taught the class more generally. The focus on classes and exams tests isn't as useful after you've finished school.",4
46451,very helpful things! I recomend this course!,4
46456,"This was my first online course that I actually completed. I enjoyed the ease of access and the genuine candor of the instructors. I could come back to the lessons at any time, but learned to learn in specific focused lengths of time with specific goals. I will utilize this knowledge moving forward in my career and personal life.",4
46469,Quite informative. All videos are short enough to keep you focused. Key ideas are helpful and practical.,4
46475,"the course hasn't started yet but, the ideas that the professors gave me in the lectures were amazing. I am eager to see the videos that come next. I hope it helps me in unlocking my potential.",4

46598,"Great, concise course with some very solid and well-founded recommendations on how to improve your studying and acquisition of new subjects. Also great advice on test-taking techniques.The introduction to memory techniques is very light, but it really is a really rich and detailed subject in itself so it's understandable that they didn't dive too deep. Some recommendations for additional learning for memory and advanced reading techniques would be a valuable addition to the course though.Overall I highly recommend this course. Barbara is an excellent and very likable instructor and the lessons and learnings are well-sourced and easy to follow. I'm already using the techniques and seeing good results.",4
46612,"Content:A couple of simple tips and tricks that can definitely help people to learn better and faster.I personally discovered the ""Mind palace"" technique which I trust can help me a lot, so thanks !Form:Lectures well prepared, and the combination of ideas/slides is rather well made.Sometimes some videos could be shortened as the concepts are not really hard to follow.

46688,"This course is very helpful, I learned a lot of information that will change my academic career for the better.

46728,Learned a lot that will help me keep my children focused on their studies and prepare them for High school and college.,4
46740,"I find the videos to be a little bit dry, and sometimes i end up accidentally focussing more on the visuals(images and little clips and things) than the content itself.

46750,Super cool... and interesting.,4

46759,Great course. Enriching it with some additional practical learning tips and tools would make it exceptional.,4

46933,amazing course i got more out of this than 12 years of school!,4
46935,Great course,4
46939,"This course is very helpful and practical. Especially the opinion that we should focus on the process rather than the product makes great and obvious change to me. I now gradually apply myself in one thing and void to think finish it soon. But some material of the course make little relationship and I do not know what should I do actually. Such as the four phases about ""procrastination"". I think if it can offer an exact example to show how to deal with them will be better. In stead, the course only make a little further explanation on the ""cue"".",4
46949,Very useful and well taught course. Assignments could be more practical though.,4
46961,"this course gives in a fun and easy way practical tools for studying more effectively, share with us successful experience of others, and general knowledge of our brain.with only little effort you can become a better student, and a better mentor to others.",4

46982,"Refreshing view on learning techniques, if only I had these tools/tips when I was cramming as an undergraduate, I would have had a much easier (and more effective) experience. Highly recommended.",4
46985,"Excellent course, felt a little short however - but the material was fantastic!",4
46992,Prof. Oakley is awesome. It's quite difficult to understand Prof. Sejnowsky because he's just reading what he's saying.,4
47036,"I will recommend the Coursera students to start with this course in order to make the most of other future courses. My only complain will be that it relays too heavily on videos, and having a reinforcement in text would help students like me.",4
47038,Very good ideas and information for how can receive the learn and more important than that is how to use all this learned.,4
47050,One more teacher better,4
47052,Thankful for Professor Oakley and Professor Sejnowski for teaching about learning. I'm more confident in making more progress in learning now that I understand how our mind works better. Thank you!,4
47053,Course is great. I have one complaint though. Mind mapping is absolutely a brilliant technique but only when done at the end of studying a subject trying to fit together all the pieces.,4
47055,"A beautifully structured course that I enjoyed very much. All the information presented in it was packaged in an easy-to-comprehend manner by both the instructors. An added bonus - the bonus interviews and extensive resources (most of which I still need to finish) add on re-emphasize the points made in the video presentations. I have started applying the techniques taught in this course and I am sure with practice I will be able to gain a better hold on those techniques and improve my learning.Thank you both Barbara and Steve! It was a pleasant experience taking your MOOC. :-)Best Wishes,Swati",4
47058,"A very useful course, especially if you are returning to an academic environment and want to improve your approach to your studies. Not only can you learn techniques to be more effective as a learner, but increase your understanding of why these techniques works. There are also interesting optional materials, such as interviews, available!",4
47065,Very simple but insightful course. I especially like the options interview at the end of each weeks lectures.,4
47070,Great course with tools to use anywhere.,4
47073,"I landed up reading the book that this course was based on and I feel it did an excellent job condensing the concepts from the book into an easy to absorb fashion. I plan to use many of the recommendations this course made and already found the lesson on the diffuse mode helping my more creative endeavors (made my Best Man speech much better when I just let my mind wander first!). However, while I found the HW assignments made this course easy to complete which is likely the goal, I'm wondering if the course could be more creative in providing assignments that really help the students practice to absorb the concepts for this book for the long term.",4
47082,This is an amazing course. Everbody should take it.,4
47087,"Currently I'm MD graduated and pass my first board the last year and now I'm studying to complete all my boards, and this course actually is helping me to be a better learner now comparated with before, the techniques and advices related how to learn more efficiently and deep are excellent.",4
47115,"I really enjoyed this course and found it to be very helpful. A lot of the information was common sense, but the science behind the rationale was very interesting and useful in learning anything new. It will also be very helpful to me as I commit to learning and retaining new information. I know the steps and their value in creating a better working memory and long-term memory for myself.",4
47128,Course is informative and organised. I would like to sincerely thank both the professors and their team who put all this together.,4
47141,"Useful, mostly common sense, but I definitely picked up a few new tips, and as explained in the course, a small change can make a big difference.",4
47162,"Great material, great lecturer! Well done",4
47174,"This course help me to structure my knowledze about sevreal learning principles which i once heard or read about (e.g. overlearning, focused/difused modes,procrastination problems) plus I was first acquintated with some new learning techniques such as ""pomodoro"".Good ""delivery"" of material from lectors, and several really exciting additional videos. My overall score for course 4.5",4
47179,Very useful for my future learning !,4
47180,It's a great course.It changes the perspective of the way we learn and the ways which we thought obsolete were the best ways to learn. The best course that I had ever taken.,4

47218,make your have some idea about learning.and the tips mentioned in this course really help you in your future learning.,4
47223,Good basic knowledge but I felt that I already knew most of it. Still very well put together and definetly recommend it to high school or university students.,4
47231,Important for my future learning.,4
47233,"I think that diffuse the knowledges for free is a beautiful thing but i think also that i can learn quickly if i can learn also in my mother language because my englesh is not so good. I understand that also this is a way to speak a better english for me, but is possible that other students know already english language.",4
47265,"Many thanks to the Lecturer.This lecture is very useful and makes me able to learn more efficiently.A minor critique of mine: Introduction part or the first week lecture seems not coherent with the final part. The week four lecture is narrowed to ""taking test techniques"" while since the start I expect that the lecture will cover broader techniques in mastering certain skill like: studying, playing guitar, doing office activity, etc (as explained in week1).",4
47279,"I like it, great course. this even if my connection isn't so good in this days, but luc",4
47287,"Simple and useful ideas and practices. helps you to understand why your learning has NOT always been successful in the past, and provides excellent pointers on how to learn and retain what you have learnt.",4
47329,Excellent information. Valid research information.,4
47342,I like this so far and have been using some of the information in my other class on Software Security.,4
47373,"If only I knew these techniques earlier in my life, thank you so much :)",4
47377,"Would give a 3 1/2 stars. This course if very simple and light. Have wonderful insights that help with time management, memorization, being efficient and becoming a better learned. If you have extra time and would like to improve upon your skills, I recommend to take this course. Compared to other courses available, this is one of the simplest course out there and requires around 30-45 minutes a day of video watching.",4
47390,"It's apparently not true that ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks!"" I learned a lot in this course, I just wish I could have taken it when I was 40 years younger. Well worth the time invested, and I hope to use some of the techniques in the near future.",4
47418,"A great course for all career paths, simple and straight forward with a short finish time. Highly recommended for all learners.",4
47421,"Very instructive course, in a totally pleasant way. It is not a strict one to follow, has a lot of interesting material in various aspects and different views of the issue. And totally pleasant instructor to watch :) It made me think about a lot, both regarding learning as a procedure, as well as about me as a learner. Thank you!",4
47422,I hope to have gained some useful tools to beat my procrastination; at the very least this course has given me the ability to identify when I slip into procrastinating and methods to break that cycle.,4
47424,Good course with some real world techniques that need to be applied in practise to fully develop our learning potential.,4
47435,Should have known these techniques before i started high school. Techniques i learned here have helped me to Increased my learning performance immensely.,4
47446,"Really a great course. I have learned a lot during this course. It was well explained, the teachers were dynamic and interesting. I believe everyone should take the 2 weeks this course requires in order to become a better learner.",4
47449,its a very useful course,4
47452,Should attend this course.,4
47453,"An amazing course integrating all the relevant concepts of psychology and letting viewers understand from the scratch. Moreover, adding interviews and discussions with veterans to the course have made it exceptionally good.",4
47469,Pretty usefull,4
47471,"This course was short and sweet, and I think has significantly helped my learning habits. My only quibble is that it sometimes seemed like Dr. Sejnowski was reading from a script, and it would have a more natural feel were he to discuss the subject more casually.",4
47494,"Excellent course, a real eye opener to the basic understanding of learning",4
47527,make the back ground more beautiful,4
47544,"This was a very concise & thorough class on learning and how to utilize it in your studies. They focus on describing the methods as valuable for science nad math, but as a designer I don't see the argument behind limiting to those subjects. They identify flaws in our natural studying practice and point to reserach in the neuroscience to help explain ideas behind the improved understanding. It was simple to do and gave me new perspectives on learning. It's worth the 4 weeks they set up.",4
47548,Its awesome.,4
47552,Very interesting and useful course.,4
47554,The teacher is really sweet and tries her hardest for anyone watching to really understand the topics.I liked that every video is only about 7 minutes long which is helpful for learning.,4
47555,"This course provided me with right direction and attitude for all my future learning.Thank you!Although the material and the style of presentation was absolutely excellent, the 1 star off is only due to some technical glitches of the course presentations(mostly Coursera I guess) - no sound or no image on videos, sound and video not synchronized.",4
47568,"As with many subjects, it is what you think you know that prevents one from making progress; both from a perspective of the lack of a perceived need for continued work as well as new and counter-intuitive concepts that are the essence of new understandings.",4
47574,Thanks for this. I think that a lot of people will find useful information in this courses. Still it's coming with a lot of background and research information from viable source to bring us some very basic points.,4
47585,Very insightful!,4
47590,The presentation is extraordinary. Practice test helped in excellent intuition. However more methods needs to be developed.,4
47591,"Very good content and teachers. The video production was a bit poor though, but in general is a very good course and everyone who has difficulty learning should take it.",4
47596,"Thank you very much. I learnt a lot from this course. I apply the activities in my real life and they help me a lot. Although, it could have been better if the videos were a bit more detailed. I completed this course in two weeks. So, it wasn't like a 4 month course. I was slightly disappointed that it was so short and less detailed. But, overall it's very good. I like the idea of people helping other people to understand how they should train their mind to learn and remember. :)",4
47600,The presenters are a little stilted in their speech but the subject matter is extremely useful. This is a course I believe everyone can benefit from,4
47613,I am not a student but a learner. I found this course to be a great introduction to the art and science of learning. It would be great if Prof. Barbara would also define a course targeted at adults. Thanks for a great experience.,4

47715,"As we are constantly learning new things this is useful in many different levels and situations, should be a recommended entry course when new to Coursera.",4
47731,"Cool, but had lots of trouble watching videos",4
47735,Veru interesting to understand in a light way how our brain works when we are trying to learn. Great teachers and easy-to-understand examples and explanations,4
47743,"Very helpful. I didn't like example of famous persons, because these are really not encouraging.And I didn't like mnemotechnics -- it's evil.",4
47750,Learning How to Learn:Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects was really an interesting course but the second last retrieval practice was not up to my mark as I think due to some technical issues it got stuck in 2 only though I had scored 4.,4
47760,Very interesting and entertaining.,4
47770,"Very helpful course, clearly explained and interesting.",4
47789,I'm a lifelong learner who never realized my true potential during my formal education. I wish I'd had a course like this available back then to teach me how to learn. The instructors offer truly valuable advice on how to effectively learn that anyone will find useful in their studies.,4
47792,This course should be taught at every primary school as a mandatory course. After completing the course i wished to come across this a decade before which could have enabled me to learn and think in a different way than what i am now thinking..!!thanks to Barbara okley madam and team for teaching this wonderful subject.,4
47796,"At 51 years old I have learned there is much more to learning, more of an efficient skill and methodology , than a drawn out complex process. Thank you, Charles.",4

48027,Great course with a really good setup!,4
48030,"This course was informative, light-hearted, and brief. Prof. Barbara Oakley shows enthusiasm and spirit, which livens up the material. Prof. Terrence Sejnowski is less fluid in front of the camera, but his scientific knowledge--the precise explanation of how Oakley's concepts work--is uncanny. I would love to see professors Oakley and Sejnowski produce an even more polished version of this course. I learned a lot and raced through the lectured thru sheer enjoyment.",4

48226,"INSPIRING course! It gives so many great advises on how we should learn more efficiently. People should practice their diffuse mode by practicing regularly and continuously. Professor Oakley has mentioned several ways to avoid procrastination. I have to admit I usually have this problem and hope that Pomodoro can help me reduce the habit. Keep concentrated on a subject, while taking good rest can not be overestimated. Wish those who have taken this course can learn from it.",4
48227,"This course is good in providing students tips for effective learning. Students are better in how to learn, however, it could be better if more cases, especially students with learning difficulties, are provided to illustrate how learning tips solve problems.",4
48249,"The course is amazing, It gave me a believe that I can learn whatever I want to despite what people may say about inverse relation between age and learning capability. I am folloing some of the guidelines and find them very helpful in learning new subjects.",4

48273,Very useful learning tips and tricks.,4
48281,very nice course but the quizzes are difficult,4
48290,"I've learned about this already from the book Your Memory. However, I believe this course has been a great refresher and I've even learned a few more new things as well.It's amazing how some of the techniques taught here seem childish (make acronyms, imagine/ visualize w/ humor, etc), but are underestimated, overlooked, and ignored.I recommend every person who wants to improve work ethic to take this course as to form a foundation to their learning structure.",4
48292,Very interesting.,4

48360,"The audio volume throughout the videos should be improved; consistently, my ears were bombarded during the first shot(s), but as soon as the side-shot plus code came into view I had to crank up the volume in order to understand what was said.Otherwise, it was a very well thought-out and enjoyable class, thanks!",4
48373,The assignment grader is not good enough,4
48401,"While this is a great course for introductory programming, I believe that it suffers from its focus on cokeskultpor UI design. The main issue I have with it is that these skills are not easily transferred to real world applications. I think some time spent on a basic introduction to tkinter would be good to help get people started on how to make their own programs.I found that the grading rubrick in particular focused too much on simple UI elements and not enough on making sure that the code was good or that the game even worked. For example, I had one person who had everything in pong perfect except that the score was added when the ball hit the paddle. This meant that the game as whole did not work as expected, but it only cost him 2 marks.",4
48404,"The cpurse is for someone who eants pure programing, in my case i want python for predictive procedures.",4
48412,Too much of a difficulty jump,4
48423,interesting and not too easy,4

48524,"The team of profs is great to listen to, even for hours on-end if/when going through several lectures per go...They have really worked through the online presentation of this software engineering 101 course to eliminate bugs, streamline its effectivity, and generally make it enjoyable for technical and laypersons alike.Kudos Team Rice!",4
48550,"Great course for any professional who wants to learn more about direct taxation and tax planning. Subjects like BEPS, EU State aid etc. are covered at length! Definitely recommended!Maybe just some small points of criticism: the assignments are not very clear, the time shown you need for the course and for the reading is not accurate, prepare for more if you wish to really get something out of the course.",4
48575,Detailed analysis. Very useful for beginners and professionals alike.,4
48577,Informative,4

48610,"I enjoyed it very much. The professor shared a lot of valuable information and talked a lot about his experiences, and it was very interesting. I have to admit, I didn't really like the simulations. The questions weren't very interesting, but I liked the idea itself of using it instead of weekly quizzes.",4
48619,A good introduction to the topic,4
48623,"It was entertaining, but it'd be easier to follow if the videos weren't *that* long. 5 videos of 10 minutes per week would be better in my opinion, it wouldn't frustrate me as much as an hour long video.",4
48626,"it was really good, because its really clear and esay to understand by the videos, talks an maybe the readings are a little bit hard but its good",4
48629,Basic but very informative.,4
48631,"Great Class,Would like even more information.",4
48634,awesome brainstorming,4
48636,A simple and short course about learning what constitute international criminal law.,4
48641,Very informational and interesting.,4
48660,A great initiative to promote international criminal law in the world. I am really enjoying it.,4
48675,"I have no foundation in criminology of any kind and thus, this was heavy stuff for me. I like how the videos paused at certain intervals to check if I understood what was being mentioned. It's also good to have online simulation for me to get things going.I appreciate the inclusion of real life examples where I have heard of some of them before via newspapers. This brings it easier to be able to understand a little more.",4

48829,"Loved the course. Content is great and presentation is great too. For first 5 seconds of 1st video I thought maybe I didn't choose the right course but after that, I was impressed by the passionate and effective presentation style of the professor. Lot of concepts covered in 3 week course, so it's more like a quick overview type. Quizzes were decent. Only reason I withheld 5th star in rating because I wish we had access to download material (slides) but still I'd recommend others to take this course.As always, I appreciate the people who produced and delivered the course.",4

48916,"Friendly teaching style, clear accent...I had a great start!",4
48917,Great course. Highly recommended!,4

48961,"A short course, but I did come away with a better understanding of how materials behave at a molecular/atomic level. I already had some experience with semiconductor physics and some of the basic chemistry ideas. The deformation curve helped me cement how/why torque specs are developed and used. The eutectic and eutectoid explanations were also very helpful.",4
48965,Very good overview of material science - lecturer did not get too deep inside each of the issues but he gave us an overview with hints for future studies.,4
48967,"The course was amazing, and fruitful.",4
48968,"My respective teacher has given us a task to complete this course,as a sessional activity. Astonishingly, when i heard the title of the course ""Materials Science: 10 Things Every Engineer Should Know"";their is not a single thing that come into my mind that what could probably the thing that we don't know.After completing the course,:Suprisingly';I find that actually i know about the 10 things.Eventually, I realize that i am not certain about the facts or building blocks about material science that this(10 things) is the main stream of it. Appreciatively, it is a remarkable knowledge that i have come to know about 'Material Science'.",4

49185,"very good start to those who love to learn korean and have watched couple of korean drama before (it will help alot at some point in this course) the only thing this that disappoint me was they didnt explain Final Double Consonants, which really make it little harder for me ( actually i went and learnt it from YouTube ) .butHuge Thx Yonsei",4
49188,"easy to follow with new vocabulary to learn..plus, simple step by step is shown. useful for those interested in learning basic korean.",4
49193,"Easy to follow the lectures which are systematic and structured.

49197,It's a very good course for those who want to improve their speaking skills.,4
49199,"this course is well-organized although with the course going on i t goes more difficult, it is also a good challenge for us.",4
49202,Fun learning !!,4
49220,"The videos went a bit fast for me and the course tried to cover too many things in each video in my opinion, but overall it was a good introduction to Korean! The lecture notes were very helpful--I recommend printing them off and using them to follow along with the lecture videos.",4
49229,It would be better If there are more explanations of grammar,4
49255,Very good course to take along side with studies to help give more common conversations practice and explanations of grammar rules.,4
49260,"Great first step course. Included reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension. I picked up reading and writing best; speaking (specifically pronunciation) was hard).",4
49261,"If you're looking to lean Korean, taking this course will help set the foundation for learning Korean and teach you some of the basic communication skills. It's easy to follow and the work required is manageable.",4
49266,"Was a great course. Very well structured, with a nice teacher. I learn a lot and I understand every lesson. So thank you for that effort. I'm gonna keep practice, never stop.",4
49278,very nice and easy to learn !,4
49288,I have been waiting for a Korean language course with coursera for a long time. it is very good course for beginner; I had all the explanations and the pronunciation techniques were helpful.,4
49290,"I have been teaching myself (attempting to) Korean via various methods over the past 9 months, but I really enjoyed the structure of this class. It helped me understand WHY sentences/words are structured as they are, instead of just memorizing a lot of vocabulary and cramming too much information in my head at once. Can't wait for more from Yonsei University!",4
49305,The course is mind blowing!With time and patience it is easy to get the language and the phrases.I only struggled really hard with telling the time.Also being hard of hearing made it a little hard to pinpoint exactly what time they were talking about.Overall this course is wonderful and anyone who is interested in basics of Korean should take it!Thanks a lot!!,4
49317,"I learn most of Korean from entertainment programme, but this class help me to correct the pronunciation and learn a lot about the Korean.This class is easy for all the people who wants to learn the basic Korean and Korean culture, and you can have a better understanding about this lovely beautiful country!----Shuyu Wang from China",4
49323,Hello teacher this course is very interesting for me and make me know more about Korean culture and Korean language basic. I looking for award you offer course level 2.thanks,4
49328,Good for new Korean learners to start from zero.,4
49343,easily understood and has improve my korean language a lot,4
49344,Very good online course,4
49347,"Great course, very informative and well organized.",4
49354,Well structured and well paced.,4
49361,"It was a good class, and definitely laid down a foundation for learning and understanding the lesson. However, it was difficult at times trying to understand, the professor would say the Korean too swiftly.",4
49364,easy learn,4
49373,easy to learn. hard to remember.,4
49385,Korean language is so difficult,4
49388,I just previewed the course and the tutorials are hassle free and simple to learn from! I knew a few basic things about Korean and the videos helped me brush up on my past knowledge. I'm looking forward to the current session of the course to begin so I can complete it and be better at Korean!,4
49393,"I learned Korean nearly 20 years ago and decided to work through this course as a refresher. The course is fairly well done. The pace is a little aggressive, which is fine if you take your time to learn each lesson before moving on. Language courses are not the kind where you can just listen and then take the quiz. Slow down. Practice.By week four the speakers in the audio files were speaking on a level where I was having difficulty distinguishing some of the words. In particular, the differences between the 20th and 21st of the month can be somewhat challenging for a beginning speaker of Korean. On the quizzes, I slowed down and repeated some of the audio. Even so, I missed a few questions. I think the course should take more care in producing the audio files and planning the questions. Some of those my be nearly impossible for beginners to get correct.",4
49398,"It's easy for a beginning learner,the teacher taught the structure and the framework that Korean are formed.It seems that we can use the method that we learn English to learn Korean.It's an interesting course.",4
49399,"It is a very good course for everyone to learn basic of Korean. For me who have learned Korean by read Korean lesson book somehow this course not give much thing to learn.GRAMMAR (5/5)This course is good because it give me more insight about Korean grammar (difference between normal. formal, and informal speech; the using of 예요/ 이에요, 이/가, etc).THE TEACHER (5/5)She explain clearly and give some exercise in the video to make us practice. I like the method.VOCABULARY (3/5)There were not much vocabulary in the course. I hope Yonsei University would add more new vocabulary in the course.TEST/ ASSIGNMENT (3/5)I've taken another language online course at another site that similar to Coursera. That site's assignments more complex than this course's given. This site only test our reading and listening but there were not speaking aspect that scored here. And I wish you will add writing aspect to the course.LESSON (3/5)The lessons those given here really simple. They were easy to understand, but I hope there will be a sequel of this course that will give us more advance lessons.Recommendation:- add more vocabulary,- add speaking and writing assignment,- a sequel of this course.Thank you for coursera and Yonsei University for giving me an opportunity to learn Korean Language for free.",4
49400,"I have studied Korean for about 10 months and still found some of the information useful. The numbers and dates always confuse me till this day. Quizzes were on average too easy, just listening or multiple choice. The answers were easy to find without much thought.",4
49402,This course gives a good start. After that practice is more important which can be done through apps like memrise.,4
49418,Just basic stuffs :D,4
49422,Need a discussion forum.,4
49424,Nice course.Learned new things.Professor describe all things very well,4
49435,Interesting one....,4
49444,"Very Good Course. But everybody should get the opportunity to submit the quiz at least, even if we get don't get the certificate.",4
49446,Hands on coding should be present,4
49448,Very gentle introduction to IoT. The topics covered are fine and the instructor is very good at explaining and presenting the material.,4
49456,This course does a great job introducing terms of embedded systems and IoT. Although the week 4 about internet protocols needs more lessons and lectures to get clear ideas before the final work.,4
49457,Inroductory course. Good for begineers,4
49459,This is very good start for beginners. But more insights can be covered though.,4
49460,very nice course ...lot of things learn from this course,4
49463,It is good introduction for students that don't have previous knowledge in the field. Instructor is also good.,4
49471,A good introductory course !!! Should be followed up with lots of readings ...,4
49473,"The introductory session is really great ,but it can be explained little more deep technically !!!",4
49474,Very good course! But they need create more interactive activities and videos for explain theory concepts and show more real examples.,4
49477,"The topics sometimes are very superficial, containing little information. But at all, the course is good.",4
49478,"Despite the fact that this course isn't really difficult at all, it gives you the opportunity to introduce yourself in the area of microprocessors. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the area of IoT and embedded systems. You should really understand the concepts of this course before diving into the world of IoT.",4
49481,Great ContentThinks for sharing this great content,4
49488,"My first on-line course ever. I didnt know what to expect however, I have learned a lot of new concepts. This intro course have me pumped to see whats next. I already ordered my Arduino on Amazon. I dont know what to say but, I'm excited.",4
49490,Good introductory course that gives you an overview to what you should know before starting other courses in the specialization. Some of the contents are a bit too obvious to someone with a previous background in IT.,4
49491,Good course taught in an interesting and engaging way. Quite high level; I'm looking forward to diving deeper in to the subject int he upcoming courses. A few places where the assignments felt a little tedious.,4
49497,course was really good. this will be very useful for begineers in embedded systems and IOT.,4
49501,I really enjoyed this course. I liked the forced research into micro-controllers and embedded systems.I would however like to stress that the use of peer reviewed assignments slows the pace of the class down greatly. People sometimes like to progress a lot faster. Difficult to do when waiting for others.,4
49504,"It is really nice, well structured and well delivered.",4
49506,Nice Introductory course,4
49515,A correct introduction to the iot,4
49517,Thanks,4
49522,"Pretty nice course for basics. Doesn't exactly go into the programming side, but gives you basic background information for IoT things.",4
49538,"Too much basic, but have some key concepts.",4
49539,"I love this Course, it has open my mind to very simple areas of electronics and communication",4
49543,Very useful approach to IoT for a newbie in this field like me. Hoped to see more practical stuff.,4
49548,It is an Excellent course. First i will thank to coursera for provide these type of courses.Students must get a very good knowledge when they did attend the all sessions.,4
49549,Nice introduction at a very basic level. Good if you know nothing about this subject.,4
49551,"Great course, but there is no forum for interacting with fellow students",4
49552,"This course has been in overall complete, I feel there should be more practice, If you do this course don't expect practicing, only learning and having quizzes.",4
49558,Good course for beginners.,4
49560,"It was good, as per the introductory part",4
49571,Good introduction to IoT,4
49578,Very good introduction.,4
49579,Good attempt.,4
49580,an useful introductory course for Internet of Things and Embedded Systems,4
49583,"Starts off really basic, but is thorough. Overall, very informative.",4
49590,It was very informative,4
49594,Nice course and builds good foundation for forth-coming courses.,4
49596,It is a very informative course! Well taught .,4
49599,Very interesting introduction to IoT. Provides lot of context before programming actual IoT devices.,4
49605,Some peers were really picky when there was no need to.,4
49610,"I learned a lot, and i'm going forward in the mastery of IOT. Thank you very much.",4
49612,A very very basic introduction of IoT for beginners,4
49613,"This course provides a very good introduction to Internet of Things for beginners. However, the topics are not covered in much depth and feel a bit superficial.",4
49615,"I loved the way Prof. Ian Harris teaches. It is so easy to understand. This is a nice introductory course for IoT and Embedded System. An easy one!Except for second week's assignment (which was slightly vague), rest was all good!",4
49617,"very happy with this course,way of teaching was very understandable and nice.",4
49620,Great way to start Internet of things and Embedded System journey if you're new to the subject.,4
49630,"Enjoyable, accessible introduction to IoT. Progresses at a good pace.",4
49646,Good introduction course.,4
49647,"Not as deep as i would like, but good intro and well presented..!",4
49652,Very good course for understanding basics of IoT hardware/embedded systems.,4
49653,"Not very detailed and quite general. Nevertheless, you get a good sense of what IoT devices are and how the work. For an introduction, it's ok, but I expected more information and more assignments to make it really useful. In terms of value for money, I'd say you're better of spending a few hours on Google and forums.",4
49660,No forums or discussion,4
49671,"This is very good introduction to Internet of Things domain. Specially the content related to components of embedded, IoT devices and Protocols.",4
49686,Great Course.,4
49689,Good very high level introduction to IOT and embedded systems,4
49695,Good simple overview of what IoT is and which component it consist of and how these works,4
49704,"The concepts in the course are well taught, but the syllabus is a little boring because of more theoretical concepts and very less practical concepts",4
49705,Nice overview of the IOT with lot of real time examples.,4
49709,Very nice basic things on IOT.,4
49710,Excellent Content and excellent domain of the topic by the Professor.,4
49712,I totally recommed this. Prof. Ian explains each and every concept very well.,4
49714,Good basic introduction. If you are already familiar with computers you may want to skip it though.,4
49717,It is not too much technical so for being an introduction is perfect,4
49720,Appreciate the simplified presentation of each topic.,4
49726,Gives good insights on the fundamentals. Would be an excellent introduction for a beginner.,4
49727,Quite basic.,4
49736,I liked this course because I actually got to know what Internet of things is etc,4
49739,very detailed and boring introductory but it is very useful as a start.,4
49740,Content is very light but it is good for an absolute beginner.,4
49742,"It's a good introductory course. I would have expected some more ""meat"" on the bones, but still I have to remember this is the first course out of a series so most probably it is good enough.Teacher is good and, even for a non English speaker student as I am, it is perfectly understandable and clear.",4
49744,Even for beginners easy to understand. Coolest professor :-),4
49752,I think this is easy introduction to the topic and assignments put you to think. If you're more seasoned with the topic or you have background in e.g. embedded systems this course does not bring much to you but can be used as easy refresher.,4
49754,clearly explained and a very good course to startup with iot! loved it,4
49756,"Good quality information, excellent instructor.",4
49760,Nice introduction to the IoT world. Course contents are a bit repetitive and lessons could have been a bit shorter.,4
49762,"Personally I had trouble with week 2 of the course. I think more details on the types of inputs and outputs with some examples would have been useful. For example, I'm still not sure whether buttons are considered tactile or electronic inputs. It might be obvious to others but I can see see how it can be argued either way.",4
49764,"This is a well taught introduction, especially for those who need a general view of what is needed for designing an IoT device.",4
49766,Good overview of what makes an IoT device different from a normal household device,4
49784,Good introductory course,4
49785,This course needs no previous knowledge about the field. The instructor takes you from the scratch.,4
49786,"Good course, the teacher is very good in explaining the subject",4
49791,Awesome Course,4
49798,"Really crisp content as introduction to world of IoT. MANET's, network layer sessions are very informative.",4
49799,Solid Introduction into the topic of IoT.,4
49800,Was a good introduction to IoT,4
49801,Good start for a novice,4
49805,This course gives a broad overview of what the Internet of Things is and the components that comprise IoT devices.,4
49807,Basic stuff but informative,4
49810,Great course!,4
49819,I enjoyed this course it was fast and easy to do my only complaint is that when you submit your final project it is a little complicated to send but other than that this course is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn this skill as well.,4
49847,"It's a good way to start in code. But it's just for a program; well still being a good course, funny and you can learn a lot :) thanks",4
49849,"Very nice and cute course. Highly recommended, it uses Scratch to teach programming.",4
49863,"Great course on introductory computer programming! The video lectures are clear, concise, and well-produced. Quizzes and assignments integrate and reinforce learning objectives well, while still adding new challenges. The fact that Instructor Areti Manataki is gorgeous, very articulate and knowledgeable, and enthusiastic is an added bonus!!",4
49866,"You will have to make a Scratch account (free) for this course.Areti is a very clear instructor that explained concepts very well for complete beginners into programming, like myself and I found the course insightful.1) Presentation - I couldn't help but wonder whether they had a lower target age (teenagers or younger) in mind, which was entertaining at some points but also distracting at other times. // Also, I only realized halfway through the course that it is in fact possible to see what Areti is doing on the Scratch program once the quality of the video is adjusted.2) Projects/Time Commitment - Going through the lectures and quizzes are not time consuming at all, but the projects (especially the final project) takes a lot of time. It took longer than expected because I felt like much of the practical instructions on how to use Scratch for specific purposes were not provided during the course, leaving me to work by myself.3) Discussion Forum - When I took the course, the discussion forum was close to being dead (especially compared to some of the other courses that I was taking simultaneously on Coursera). Gerry (mentor) did an amazing job responding to my inquiry, but I noticed that although there were a lot of students talking at the beginning, introducing themselves, there weren't that many discussions concerning the final assignment, making me feel like I was working alone. It would be great if there was more time to work on the final project, and perhaps a way in which students can collaborate and help out others when faced with a bug (ie preliminary project submission and feedback session).I recommend taking this course, but realistically, you won't be program proficient after 5 weeks. You will, however, learn some basic programming theory, understand how programming works, and learn how to make a fun interactive game on Scratch!",4
49870,This was a fun course. Helped understands the basics of software development. The lectures were small and that I guess was the best part. A lot of projects helped in really putting all that knowledge into real projects.,4
49874,"A very charming and helpful course, which introduces you to programming world in a funny way.",4
49894,"Good Course, for folks who never took any Comp Sci courses in high school or university",4
49896,"The course is an essential for making a solid foundation for whom, their desire is CODING!",4
49903,"its a amazing course,very interactive,perfect explanations but is something i have saw,and the linguage isn´t so usefull..but is very nice.i liked",4
49909,"This course is pretty fun. Also, despite the perhaps childlike impression one gets of the programming language Scratch, it still resembles other languages in logic and in prinsiple. Towards the end of the course, we saw the same few lines of code in Scratch and Python, and it showed their similarity.",4
49910,I really enjoyed this course it was very informational and fun.,4
49923,Interesting!,4
49924,Interesting method for teaching programming. Very basic. Very visual. It was worth my time.,4
49927,Great course!!!,4
49930,"More tooled for High Schoolers, or those just entering into college. Very good course none the less.",4
49931,nice course i loved it,4
49937,Easiness and difficult level are great for beginners and people with tight schedules,4
49944,"This is an excellent introduction to programming. The exercises are very dynamic and the tutors did a great job by explaining the program, both in English and Spanish. The bonus interview might seem like extra time but it's totally worth it. The only recommendation for the class is not to rush the exercises after the 3 week. Thank you!",4
49950,Easy way to get to know what programming is about.,4
49954,I enjoy the Course :) and i learn new things.,4
49956,I think this is a great course for understanding the basics in programming.,4
49960,"The course was highly informative, entertainingly presented and does not require an unreasonable amount of time to complete. It serves well as an introduction to programming, especially the two course projects, where the peer review system works well. The instructors and mentors show a commitment to helping students and improving the already well-run course. An unusual and welcome feature of this Coursera course is the immediate verification of one's typing. My only criticism is the lack of downloadable written/pdf material related to the course, although students who go on to learn programming languages will likely relearn much of the knowledge they gained here.",4
49969,i knew everythig which didnt make it challenging at all but i improved my skills alittke,4
49973,Very helpful to get a logical perspective and to brush up on basics.,4
49975,This code is great to learn the fundamentals of Python. The videos are interactive and the quizzes and assignments will help you practice it in detail.,4
49980,"Fair. I liked the lectures, though being non-native english speaking i had to look some termanology, as some of it was not explained futher than a brief staint of the right side of the page. Previous knowledge with MATLAB helped a lot, as I figured out a lot of the workings, but people starting from scratch might have more difficulties, as I struggled quite a bit with the read and write. I figure maybe it wouldn't be bad to have more throwbacks to previous stuff in the tests, as to really make it connect. Some of it sits pretty loosely in the memory.But overall, I was quite happy with the course! I really liked the assignments - If anything, consider putting in a assignments at the end, that might be a bit bigger and incoorperates more different things from the various courses, and let the course-goer try out what they learned, and maybe have some tools for help, such that everyone walks away with the feeling of having ""written a program"" :)",4
49981,Good introduction. Quite rigorous,4
49983,"A challenging introduction, goes fast but gives you what you need to get through. I learned a lot.",4
49989,"As a beginner, I found this course helpful. The approach of teaching is quite good, I also like the assignment which is often the part of a complete and meaningful program. But, I think plotting in python is missed in this course, which is equally important to other sub-course",4
49991,"i thoroughly enjoyed this course though i am new to programming ,This course has not only helped me learn python fundamentals but laid a good foundation to develop programmatic thinking.",4
49999,"It was a really helpful course! I had previous experience in programming (I have written scripts in Fortran), but having the opportunity to learn a much modern language such as Python was really entertaining.The assignments were made so that I could utilize each lesson and so did each quiz.I would firmly recommend this course to people with little to none programming knowledge!",4
50021,"A little advanced with the concepts, but if you re-watch the videos and take your time with the assignments, it will help give you a greater understanding of the work in class.",4
50023,This course could have been better if the TA's were a bit more active.,4
50024,Very good... Beginners can learn a lot of stuff by taking this course...,4
50026,"This is a great course for beginners . If you can spend more time after the second week, you will get best out of the course .",4
50028,"Great course for learning python, still use it as a reference",4
50037,"Pro : 1. Instructors explained the fundamentals in details.2. The lessons are concise and with just enough information.Con : 1. This course is not updated to the latest Python 3.5 (even in 2016).2. Many solutions of the quizzes should be explained afterward.3. The lack of interactions between students due to the ""design limit"" of Coursera.orgOverall : A decent fundamental course to help step into Python 3 programming and computer science.",4
50057,Great course. I learnt the importance and use of a good docstring! Some of the quizzes are a bit heavy going.,4
50063,"the course is pretty good; however, it gets really fast after 3rd week, which is not well-adjusted",4
50065,It's great course. I enjoyed every lecture. 4 stars just because sometimes videos and book weren't enough for me to understand so I looked for additional online help.,4
50069,Great course to start with if you want to understand the principles of programming!,4
50070,It's good for beginners.,4
50071,This course is very good for the beginners but the last two weeks lack some content which is required for the quizzes.,4
50083,Well taught course which does as it says and introduces the fundamentals of programming using the python language.,4
50086,Great course! This course deep dives into the Python and provided me immediate hands on coding. I enjoyed experiments with this language. The quizzes and final exam were tough but fair. The only complaint I have is that the python visualization tool quiz questions were confusing. I like the visualization tool; it allows one to view code execution which was a must for this course.,4
50090,"Good for novices, but need more practical problems.",4
50098,A good course for beginners.,4
50104,Short description of the course. Links to already available courses are missing.,4
50116,Excelent course I got new skills and habilities about the marketing and sales.,4
50121,"I need subtitles in spanish, content is good",4
50125,"it covers good vocabulary related to mkt and sales, but I would like to learn more vocubaulary related to idiom or english culture. they use some, but they could be more.",4
50127,Very fundamental and solid introduction to basic optics.,4
50130,well explained. It would be more good if an entirely new worksheet is given for work at the end of course,4
50131,"Great content and examples. Sometimes, the theoretical background could be explained more comprehensively in the lectures.",4
50133,Some notions introduced too fast and with little explanations. Overall very interesting and applicable.,4
50135,Good learning experience,4
50137,The content is extremely valuable and was delivered in a very good way fully engaging the learners!One thing I would improve in future is the time assessment for the assignments and reading - some took me way longer than suggested and others way shorter. In addition it would be nice to have the workload distributed eavenly along the weeks not pushing the most timeconsuming assignments to the last stage.,4
50153,"Great course! I enjoyed a lot from the journey of western classical music from medieval till contemporary. The teaching style of Dr. Wright is engaging and accessible for beginners. I will come back to the lectures and the YouTube lists of full pieces of music even after the completion of the course. This course further develops my interests in music, and I started playing keyboard synthesizer during the course and am learning music theory. The only thing that maybe could improve is the quizzes. Currently, all the quizzes are multiple choice questions mainly on musical terminology. It would be even greater to have more listening exercises and different kind of assignment like peer reviewed writing.",4
50164,Super long. Super informative. Loved the Beethoven week.,4
50177,"I have taken this course before. If I remember rightly it was a longer course (11 weeks?) and the pacing felt good. It seems it has been compressed into a 9-week course, with some weeks having quite a heavy workload demand and the whole course feeling slightly crammed and rushed.I realise that perhaps the longer the course, the higher the dropout rate, but I think people who made it to 7-8 weeks of the old course would continue it to completion, while for this course I found myself scrambling for time almost weekly -- I wonder if in fact the dropout rate wouldn't be higher at this kind of pace.Content-wise the course was excellent -- stimulating, clear, engagingly presented.",4
50194,"Excellent panorama of classical music.I specially like the lesson about Mozart and the ""Dark side of Mozart"", and what was said about the social evolution of the musicians.",4
50198,Amazing teaching,4
50199,"I feel Professor Craig Wright offers a comprehensive, varied, accessible and fun overview of a very large subject, starting right at the beginning of musical history and bringing you up to the present day. He uses a wide variety of visual and audio resources including relevant works of art, architecture, artefacts, sketches, quotes from historical documents, surviving musical scores, music recordings, videos of live orchestral performance, music animations, costume, period instruments and interviews with musical colleagues of his who are able to share their expertise. In addition to all this he offers us his own photographs from his pilgrimages to cities such as Vienna, which adds further to the course's personal touch.What comes across throughout Wright's course videos is his immense love of, and desire to share that love of classical music, which for me is a major factor in what makes the course so appealing. I also enjoy his sense of humour and efforts to appeal to a younger generation (Wright is in his 70s). At more than one point in the course he adopts fancy dress to reflect the period he is exploring. A highlight I feel is when the course features a clip from one of his lectures at Yale University where he enrolls some colleagues to enact a scene from Don Giovanni in which Wright plays an angry father, slain by Don Giovanni in a duel. It is a touching (and amusing) example of his good humour and ability to have fun with his students.My only criticism would be his own piano playing which is often rushed and inaccurate, but I feel this is largely due to the time constraints of filming the videos. By his own admission, he realised early on in life that he was not up to the challenge of being a concert pianist - he is primarily a musicologist, not a pianist. Every piece of music touched on in the course is available via the course Spotify playlist (extremely helpful) so there is no difficulty in listening to professional recordings of all the pieces discussed.I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking a background knowledge of the evolution of musical history.",4
50247,cool,4
50264,"Great course! I learned a lot, discovered new music and the way mr. Wright presents the content is very good.",4
50303,"Nice! I am enjoying it!!explained in simple language, so it is easy to understand.",4
50310,"Nice instruction and instructor but if i do not have any idea about health education, it would have been difficult to me. we need also some more details (larger course).",4

50382,"Through this course, I was able to learn the basics of Journalism and apply it in my job as well. The professors explain everything clearly with good examples. The course is easy and understandable. Thank you all for a great course!",4
50384,It's a good overview of journalism with interesting assignments. It'll be useful for those who knows nothing or not much about journalism.,4
50388,"The course will be interesting for those who don`t have specific knowledge about journalism. The vocabulary is rather useful, but sometimes very simple. The teachers are great - I didn`t have any problems with understanding! Thanks a lot!",4
50400,The good course and i learn so much from it.,4
50415,It's my first course at coursera and I love it so much.,4

50427,"it's a good course , but it could be offering more, like when we answer a questions wrongly, it could offer corrections and also we need more details with video journalism.",4
50436,"For a foreigner journalist like me, this course was very challenging and useful.",4
50440,"It's a course of very good quality, but personally I wanted something more challenging. I believe that since there are advanced version of texts, there should also be advanced version of tests in order to make people like me work harder. I would also like to see more peer-reviewed assignments, these are very good.",4
50449,"I just started the course, but I feel like I am taking in a ton of knowledge that I have been craving to get for along time. Really happy that I have enrolled in this course.",4
50452,"Well, I enjoyed very much taking part of this course. In my opinion the contents were just grate and according to my English level. Nevertheless, what I would like to have is the amount of hours dedicated to the course writen on the certificate. For this reazon, in my case, this will be my first but also my last of the on-line courses through coursera.Greetings,MSc. Petronio A. Piedra.",4
50467,"This course good for people who have intermediate level in English language, also it is very useful to gain double outcome or result which is your get more for English language skill and you know about jurnalism.

50502,very interesting,4
50515,Very good Course for learning fundamentals of mechanic of materials.,4
50525,"This course is a very good refresher of the basics and Dr Whiteman has explained things very clearly and precisely. Moreover, If you're following the complete series of courses, you'd have grasped a good command over stress analysis. However, in the last leg of this course, I felt that couple of cases with statically indeterminate structures should have been in more detail.I highly recommend this course to everyone looking for a refresher in ""Strength of Materials"". I am eagerly waiting for the next part in this series.",4
50526,Very Simple... Very Interesting... Clear and simple examples...Very good for refreshing with very basics.,4
50529,"there is a lot of Errors in your words and you correct it by Messages but it make a lot of destrbution for us , You are very quickly please be little slow when you speake , we need more Examples and please mention for us before the module what module we should revice in your courses or out before go ahead on it.",4
50548,"I loved this course, mainly due to our wonderful Professor. He focused on very pertinent subjects in Psychology (I felt like we covered the highlights of a whole year worth of subjects in 10 weeks) AND he did it in a very engaging and fun way. In a nutshell, he is AWESOME!What I did not like, which is also why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is mainly due to organisational matters:1) the course schedule does not follow the weeks as listed in Coursera which creates TOTAL confusion, and it can be very easily solved. At the very least, the mid-term and final exams should be placed after the correct weekly schedule. Right now it is shifted by a week (earlier)2) The instructions about the peer assignments were not fully clear. I think also there, this is a quick fix and quick win. Simply adjusting the wording to better explain the process would help reduce questions on the forum.3) There was almost no staff involvement in the forum. The responses were very far in between, which also made the forum discussions not as lively or exciting. I would have loved having the professor himself on the forum, or at least one of his assistants in the forum, sparking discussions, responding to threads etc. This was almost on existent.So in short, I would highly recommend the course due to its content! But I also feel that there are organisational improvements, which if made, would make this course a true 5 star course!",4
50574,"I enjoyed everything about this course. The lectures were snappy, engaging and informative. The topics moved quickly, but not so much that it skimmed.The resources don't always work (because the links are external) and the exams are misaligned, with questions on the Week 6 exam based on lectures from Week 7. This is a problem, and will reduce people's grades for sure, but this doesn't sway me from recommending this course.",4
50577,Very friendly approach & easy way of teaching made me more positive. Some PPTs were dark so that i couldn't focus well on letters but all other aspects were nice. Especially my Prof. Steve Joordans was very friendly. i miss his lecture a lot. Overall it was a wonderful experience. Thanks a lot.,4
50582,"Thoroughly enjoyed the teaching style of this instructor. Would have preferred to continue future educating with the same instructor. The courses do account for time out of the education system. Ppl can also sign on at their convenience and the deadline reminders were a life saver. I have already signed up to continue moving forward, keeping an active brain and learning. Thrilled!",4
50603,I can understand the concept in a better way....I really enjoyed this.,4
50605,"the course was very enjoyable and I learnt a lot. The coursera app for iOS was diabolical before the update and only so-so afterwards,",4
50635,"Great course, really glad I got the chance to participate!",4
50643,"I found the course pretty engaging. I enjoy studying it and also feel encouraged to do some further study. However, the topics that are taught are not very holistic to me compared to some other basic psychology courses. Anyway, it's still a nice course to take :)",4
50659,"The course itself is great, but a lot of the links they provide are dead.",4
50674,"its good but i need something more advanced , more questions and answers , more articles , more videos.and also it needs Arabic subtitles .but i am so grateful to the work you have done to spread something valuable like this",4
50677,Total content of the course was very good. Daily life application based questions were also quite interesting. But there were also some negative points such as lectures were not very elaborated and the answer submission system in the quizzes were very frustrating.,4

50704,Great course if you have not seen any previous information about the subject,4
50707,Nice for dummies =),4
50708,"Useful course aimed mostly for beginners, but quiz questions are formulated with ambiguity making it frustrating to answer since you end up reading between lines trying to avoid traps instead of putting your mind to work towards using the knowledge given by the course",4
50711,very informative course,4
50716,"Nice course, thank you",4
50717,"A good course, with a in depth good coverage of Agile practices and principles. For an introduction course, it focussed mainly on why and what of the proposed practices, and I am looking forward to see more about the how to.",4

50720,Good start!,4
50724,"For new entrant in Product Management this is good course, it clarify life cycles of Product Management pretty well.",4
50728,"It's a decent enough introductory course. Not amazing, and I have to admit I might be biased by the fact that I already knew much of the material beforehand, but I enjoyed taking it.",4
50729,Excellent gave me a good idea of the discipline.,4
50731,The quiz questions are generally vague in some degree. Scenario based questions could be a better option,4

50744,Good overview and introduction to main concepts.,4
50747,Very good course content and great instructor !,4
50752,"It'a good introduction to product management, but still it remains too basic",4
50766,The material presented laid a strong basic foundation for future courses. I feel as a new Product Manager I will be able to apply lessons learned in real life situations.,4

50837,"It's a great introduction to Software Product Management. Even though it's actually more of an introduction to the Specialization. But it's a great one! I just wish the instructors were a bit more clear on who the ""client"" usually is.",4

50901,Good introductory course.,4
50912,Quite good course about Software Product Management,4
50915,Very well structured course. Course content was simple to understand and rich enough to cover important aspects of the discipline. Well articulated and well delivered by the teachers.

50936,I really liked the course as simple introduction to agile.,4
50946,Nice intro to software product management.,4
50964,This course is a good introduction that includes an overview and includes Agile principles explanations for software product management.,4
50970,A bit too basic and quiz questions did not reflect the real value of what was being learnt but was just poised at encouraging us to memorize sequences of facts more than anything.,4
50973,"Although is an introduction, I stay sure this course is a good beginning for SPM. I have been studying for two weeks, and I was getting lot information about agile. I have read Erick Ries books Lean Startup, and this course cleared many misunderstood that I had.",4

51017,"Basic and clear, with a lot of charts and maps. Easy to understand.",4
51024,"Though I have worked in MNC with and people across the globe, learning the theoretical aspects of business helps you understand the process better and hence improve your work.Best Wishes.",4
51025,A good course to begin your studies on Globalization and International Business. The videos were simple and easy to follow. The quizzes were easy and intuitive. Overall a nice stop to start your studies in business in general and international business in particular.I will take up the Part 2 of the course in the future sessions and look forward to build upon the thing learnt till now. Enroll now and keep learning.,4
51047,This is a great introductory course of Microbiome with moderate pace and exposure to the latest researches on this area.,4
51052,"For someone who is a Biologist and has heard about microbiome before, this course is more a review than a course where everything is new. However, hat doesn't mean I didn't learn anything. The course was entertaning, well explained, and interesting. The interviews were simply great, with the opportunity to see experts explaining concepts and projects. For someone with less background than mentioned, it is a very nice course to do. It will change your point of view regarding microorganisms.",4
51055,Great course. Very informational. Good start for anyone looking to know more.,4
51066,"Very interesting course and very timely at the moment given the ground-breaking research in this area! I only have two minor criticisms. Firstly, the presenters seemed to be reading from a script, which made them seem quite wooden and unnatural and thus hard for me to follow at times. Secondly, I would have preferred a little more focus on what we can do to improve our gut microbial diversity. I have tried all the basic advice given with little effect. However, perhaps we just don't know enough at this stage. Also, it would be interesting to explore the anomalies a little more. For example people with high levels of firmicutes who are also lean. Overall, I found the course useful though, thank you!",4
51070,"I really loved the course. I would be thrilled to make a real gut check, even though I live in Europe (Belgium). Simone Einstoss",4
51073,"This is a review from someone zooming through the course at double speed to get a general idea of the subject for free (I did not take any tests or participate in any projects).I am studying neuroscience and this course was a great adjunct to those studies. If you have interest in biology at all, this course will broaden out your knowledge base.I took a star away because there was too much advertising for their pet project. Some mention and instruction would have added interest, but so many of the classes being dedicated to it was a bit overkill.",4
51077,"The lab portion was a little too quick for me; well, long because I didn't understand it. I need more in depth to understand how all the extracting and testing happens.",4
51079,"Good introduction into the world of microbiome. The only drawback - not enough of this precious, well-delivered information.",4
51081,"the course is very interesting, but the questions in tests are a bit too detailed and thus, too difficult; overall, during the course I learned a lot of new things, discovered new possibilites behind the gut flora and deepened my overall knowledge; if only the certificates were a bit cheaper...",4
51082,Knowledgeable course taught by great teachers!,4
51083,A great introduction to the intriguing world of Human microbiome.,4
51087,This class was very enlightening. I liked how the videos went along with the quizzes and it was easy to articulate what everyone was saying.,4
51091,"Interesting and informative. The only reason it is not 5-stars is because some lectures were too much PR, and some assignments required non-scientists to name-drop microbes and design a study without proper reference.",4
51102,Very interesting course that covers a lot. Make me more interested in all aspect of my life.,4
51105,"Course content was very good and I'd highly recommend this class. However the course policy of getting other students to grade the assignments results in people with big egos assigning other students arbitrarily bad grades. Maybe this can be fixed on the next iteration. Otherwise, bravo.",4
51111,Loved the idea of this course but a bit out of my league. I wanted more on the data and applying it in real life rather than how the data is collected.,4
51112,nice course....I am waiting for advance course.,4
51116,"Good course, I liked everything except reading from cards that made the lectures feel very artifical.",4
51122,Microbiome is like the Amazone forest! Lot of mystery!,4
51129,It is an injteresting course and provides insight into current research,4
51137,"The only thing that would create a five star rating, would be more valuable interaction among fellow students, and with the instructor as well.",4
51140,very interesting,4
51142,Eye opening. Great professors and interviewees. I recommended this to many friends,4
51143,Excellent introduction to the gut microbiome and its importance to our health. Lots of science but would have like a little more information about how to increase and balance the microbiome through nutrition.,4
51145,"great info,friendly staff and very easy to understand",4
51158,amazing course,4
51168,"I was interested in the topic. The course itself seems like just a starting point with understanding dealing with missing data. I wanted to know more and see more examples than the videos offered. I also would have appreciated including examples from more than just R, though I did appreciate the minimal discussion of other statistical software that are available for statistical analysis when it did occur.",4
51171,I enjoyed the course and appreciated his teaching style. It kept me interested and provided information that I may not have known previously. My only frustration was not being able to participate since I was auditing. Other MOOCs allow participation - you just don't get credit/certificate at the end.,4
51178,Great course for those with little knowledge of international marketing.,4
51180,"A very complete course, with many key words and definitions. The interview of LG are also very interesting, the last peer project is very educational. Be careful the interview of Swarosky jewel manager is to very relevant.",4
51181,The course is going good,4
51186,Easy entry to international market or Asia Market. Hope you could enjoy the course!,4
51195,"Wanted a little more heft to the class. Professor is good, provides clear explanation of concepts and creatively applies his own to the theory.",4
51197,Good course,4
51201,Great course.,4
51206,It was very useful to me at the same time it is a good opportunity to all for use this valuable course....,4
51210,Very good course. Sometimes a bit too simplistic.,4
51222,Good course,4
51226,A quick dive into css 3 to learn something new,4
51227,It's a great course however most of the assesment depend on peer grading,4
51234,"This is a great course for anyone beginning with Web design and styling. It not just teaches you different style elements of CSS3, but also suggests best practises in web design as well as encourages us to design for a wider audience including those who are differently-abled.",4
51241,Good course,4
51250,Good course. Teacher was good.,4
51258,"Nice course, perhaps a little bit too little effort required but that suited my schedule at this point.",4
51266,Please include some more examples and increase the difficulty level.,4
51276,I must thank you Collen and all for such styling ideas and links to help us learn and practice in professional world. Thankyou so much.,4
51283,"Great course, it made me work",4
51286,Very useful introduction to basic styling and CSS3,4
51290,"good intro course, i just wish it had more drilling exercises in CSS.",4
51294,I found this course quite thorough in its approach to CSS. It covered a wide number of properties and the variety of ways one can style simple static web page.,4
51297,Very good for the novice. The course is designed step by step intro which help a lot.,4
51313,Good pace and great teaching skills. I was a complete novice but I now pretty well understand the basics & can anticipate what is reachable.Not a 5-star though because the continuity between lessons is sometimes a bit blur.,4
51321,"Colleen van Lent made this so easy and clear to understand. There were some shortfalls with the peer reviewed grading which is the only reason why this isn't a five star review, but the content and the teaching style were absolutely spectacular! I am part of a few novice web designer groups on Facebook and I've already recommended this course to hundreds of members.",4
51329,"I feel a lot more confidence in what I am learning. Although some of the assignments have been a little confusing, it has pushed me to look for external sources to validate and seek material to complete work, pushing me to use creativity.",4
51330,"Well done, and easily understood!",4
51335,A very strong introduction to CSS3.,4
51353,"I really enjoyed this course, they do build on one another and though there's quite a bit of information, as Dr. van Lent says, use the internet as a resource. I found myself using the internet to complete many of the assignments, along with trial and error. I had fun doing this course.",4
51369,Good beginner course providing solid basics . Instructor is excellent,4
51370,Good information and great instructor.,4
51388,"It's a good course for beginner, lots of CSS properties and pseudo-class selectors are covered in detail during the classes and you will get a good knowledge about CSS. If you code along the course and do all the assignments to practice in the end of the course you will have solid foundation for continued learning and programming in CSS3. It is course that I recommend to enroll.",4
51395,"Good teacher, I learnt the basis and it's pretty cool but I'd like a bit more of responsive design in here.",4
51399,good course but i hadn't take my certificate .,4
51400,"This course was great, it really helped me to learn the basics of CSS3. However, the week number two was way too difficult in comparison to the three other weeks and sometimes a little bit confusing. I think this part was not very well balanced and they could have divided the level of difficulty more efficiently between the different weeks : this is why I removed a star in my final notation. Everything else was fantastic !",4
51402,It is a good course for beginners in CSS.,4
51403,"Thanks, I learn alot :)",4
51409,Good course,4
51411,Like the HTML class before this was new to me but Colleen's delivery of the material kept my attention and I am very happy I decided to take the course. I hope to continue with the other courses to complete the program as soon as I make myself more familiar with what I have learned so far in HTML and CSS. Thanks again to Coursera and Colleen.,4
51417,This course is definately challenging with all the new things to learn but the instructor and the student community as well as the individual learning effort make it worthwhile,4
51420,"Really solid course for a basic grounding in CSS3, only wish it had more about responsive design.",4
51429,"Not as good as HTML course, nevertheless perfect choice!",4
51443,The course is really well paced and good contents. However I think it should have a bit more indepth contents regarding CSS rules/priorties.,4
51444,good course,4
51447,"this is really nice, helps a lot if you know nothing about css.",4
51477,Thank you!,4
51478,"The material and resources are excellent. This was the first course I took without any mentors or tutors, so my participation in the discussions was very high. The following could be improved: inclusion of 'type=""text/css""' in the <LINK> element; perils of alternating between background and background-color, especially in complicated, long style sheets; links to Coursera lecture videos and materials from the students' side rather than teacher's; explanation for Assignment One if the text-align:center style should be applied to the <a> or the <nav> element (I used the nav because I wanted the menu styled below the H1 heading, which is where the menu is positioned in later assignments).I'm deducting a star for Coursera's unwillingness to respond in its Community Help Forums to its method of assigning peer review assignments and for introducing new 'features' without notice to its educational content partners. I shouldn't have to engage a very busy professional to intercede on the students' behalf. Despite the large population of people taking the class (or is that cumulative? Coursera doesn't specify), about twenty students were active on the Discussion Forums. I felt we students were left on our own which is fine as long as we all are aware that the more peer reviews we do, the more we can learn from each other.I also did not like the error message in red 'There was an upload error. Please try again' coexisting with the 'Your assignment was submitted successfully!' in green on the same page. This confused lots of us and those of us who'd never used the transloadit.com script for uploading our assignments for peer-review would only know of transmission error if classmates flagged our submissions. I identified this as an issue and Coursera didn't respond because I'm only a lowlife deadbeat student. Never mind that there are people who've paid for the courses who encounter the same issues on this platform.",4
51484,So far this was the most fun course of this specialization.,4
51515,4 stars only because of not given as much attention as I think it has to be to floating and postioning.,4
51534,"Very lively, clear, good pace, place for personnal work, a constant remainder about accessibility. However, confusion in assignment instructions spoils a little the flow.",4
51555,"Short but complete course, more practical than teorical.I learnt a lot of.",4
51557,Good course. Easy to follow for unexperienced students.,4
51563,"Again, another awesome course! Really recommend it to people who are interested in getting a grasp of CSS3 and coding hands-on.",4
51569,"Great course in the sense that we start from scratch to be able to do good design. But I think week 3 should have an assignment too (we don't really have to play with position, transition, etc ...), and that week 4 was too light (not a lot of new stuff, and only design a table as assignment).",4
51573,Good course!,4
51587,"It would be nice if it includes a little information about the Chinese characters. It's great that its focused on Pinyin and pronunciation, but it's also necessary to become familiar with the characters. This one is better than the first course (production).",4
51593,"It would be awesome to have Chinese characters included in the course. I felt that some good grammar concepts were introduced, but there were several that I felt were overlooked and could use more explanation. The vocabulary is good and I learned a lot. I like the teacher and the conversations are good listening practice. I'm happy with this course overall.",4
51596,"Well, the course offers well-explained concepts of the (difficult !) mandarin Chinese language, and takes the student forward at a slow pace for the sake of absorbing instead of just reading. Thanks !PS: try to do the quizzes without your notes ... so that it really starts sinking in. The questions aren't difficult.",4
51600,It was very good thanks :D,4
51601,Good course,4
51608,Recommend for those who wants to learn basic Chinese!,4
51638,"Very good, recomend.",4
51646,"Naturally, I was less interested in the scientific apparatus than in the conclusions.",4
51650,"The materials of the course are nicely presented, in a well-organized manner with good quality videos. The information is explained really well, it was easy to process and comprehend. I've opened a lot of new ideas for myself, as a wellness professional, it is a new field for me to keep learning about. The only downside was - it was all about research, how they did the research and how they planned the research and how hard it was and what a great job they did, and when it came to outcome analysis, it was said that it is too early to present the results - they can be presented in 2014... well, it's 2016, where are they? And then it was not enough information about the actual diet - it was about the research, not the diet itself - not very practical. So, I loved it, yes, and I want to know more, but too much about how they planned the research and not much about the New Nordic Diet itself.",4
51652,"Quite interesting. Especially the way the studies were made and how they were evaluated. It would be nice that after such long time now, to include the results of the schools study.I was also expecting more details on the NND itself : food preparation, detailed food, recipes.",4
51653,I loved the instructors and their thorough presentations. It was very eye-opening. I gained useful knowledge that can only help lead to a better life. Thank you for the opportunity.,4
51666,"Quite an interesting course with a lot of different information, practical as well as theoretical. However, it would be great to translate and upload a New Nordic diet cooking book in English, to make it available for all the students of the course.",4
51672,The course curriculum is good but the last two quizzes were not properly organized. The content of the final quizz refers a while bunch of diagrams with no indexing .,4
51673,Very good content. Very good introduction to advanced topics in embedded systems. I believe this is the first session and the course definitely needs some work to make it more interactive and engaging. Much of it is simply links to articles and then a quiz on what you read. Anyways I recommend it to anyone interested in embedded systems.,4
51677,"The courses are easy to understand, however, they are poorly designed to work on an iPad. Also, page references for electronic books are useless. It is sometimes difficult to find the reading material in a particular book because the electronic version does not show pages.",4
51681,"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 2nd Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants' learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, that's why I'm not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. I'm referring to guest interview videos. That's mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as it's always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",4
51683,"Little boring...Teacher just reading materials...And the materials is a little hard, if you lost concentration for a while...THEN YOU LOST EVERYTHING...",4
51684,"Good, but, sometimes it seems that there is not enough practical tasks.",4
51687,A very thorough look at how technology can be incorporated into a blended learning or completely virtual learning environment.,4
51693,Informative but difficult course.,4
51695,Great info but some of the terminology was rather vague in explaining. Would of loved a glossary to refer to.,4
51701,"It is a dry subject, but these folks do a good job of making it as relevant as possible. I like the variety in the video lectures and the BYOE is a neat tool.",4
51704,This is a very good course to understand the mechanism of how our earth works and how complex the mechanism is.,4
51705,Best for understanding the basics .,4
51713,Some of the videos were a bit silly.,4
51714,Good stuff so far: hoping to get more in-depth about specific types of classroom situations (all that pesky cognitive stuff) beyond just the history of approaches,4
51724,"Nice course. I only wish you focused on the target audience a bit more, and did not asume we all need to be ""amused"" with weird antics.Thanks.",4
51727,Very informative and easy to follow.,4
51730,"I was never a good learner of theories...they presented these lessons well. They use many American idioms. If you can get past that, the course is a good learning experience.",4
51733,"amazing course.Thank you.Now I each time I want to remember any of the approaches, I will remember the video attached to it and quickly remember the main features of each approach. This was quite challenging to me over the years. Thank you for making it possible.",4
51755,great that was,4
51760,The course was well presented and used great instructional design. It provided a good overview of various teaching approaches.,4
51766,"Much more useful than the first course. It was very interesting to see that methodology has a different approaach according to the purpose of the class that is not necessarily communication. Great experience Although I think that the questions for peer revision are so general aand vague that one is almost forced to give a good grade even if the assignment is just a re-telling of what was presented on the video, sometimes even word by word.",4
51767,the course till far is good,4
51781,It teaches us the techniques in the history. very useful,4
51784,It's very helpful to understand teaching language. The origin of every step of skill.^^,4
51788,"Great, it's very helpful and you learn a lot of things that will help you in classes",4
51802,"This course provides me opportunity to teach my kids in effective way that is proved to be in line with research on learning second language. I rate it the best course in this regard and would like to say special thanks to Dr Shane Dixon and all his team. I felt my teaching skills are improved after completing this course but there is still space for improvement in final assessment, in my opinion, there should be a thorough understanding for the participants of the course on how this final assessment could be beneficial for them. However the overall impact can be expressed in a big Thanks.",4
51808,"to me as a total newby in the topic the content was really interestinghowever, its presentation. well. I truly thank the teachers for bringing together the review of all the approaches. but the manner of presentation was so artificial I couldn't help thinking just - when will the real learning begin? without all the silly role plays?again, thanks, I tearned a lot from the course. but I did also struggle through it because of the teachers' manner of presentation",4
51809,Very well presented. Helped me remember a lot from what I studied in my university and gave me a clearer and new perspective.,4
51812,"The course is well done and will definitely serve many teachers who would want to draw from history and gain some tested approaches to teaching English. The teaching method can be not so academic but for many people, this perhaps serves best.",4
51819,Great for new teachers as it gives them the fundamentals of langauge learning theory. Also very good memory refresher and knowledge connector for experience teachers as it is well summarized and integrated presentation of such theories .,4
51840,Creative presentation and good overview of the material. Not very challenging.,4
51865,"Lot's of interesting background to language teaching and learning. The material is presented clearly although the instructor may not be to all students' taste. Keep going, however, as the later courses are even better!",4
51871,"I like how the course was structured, it made it easier to absorb all the historical comparisons of instruction methods.",4
51878,a great course!! I hope to learn a lot,4
51880,"i found it entertaining and informative. It leaves room for discussion but has given me a non ESL teacher an interesting insight into the theories of Language Acquisition.I am interested in the way one Teaching Discipline takes knowledge from another, repacks it and sells it under their School of Teaching in almost the same way the despicable H.R. industry relaunches every few years.In summary a good section of the course well presented but i hate ""Tests or Exams"" :-(",4
51898,"Good overview of the last 150 years of language teaching philosophy. The back-in-time and angel-and-devil skits were a little cheesy sometimes, but they helped to keep things interesting. More detail on some of the information presented would be nice, but it seems to be aimed at inexperienced teachers or people with native languages other than English, and so the level is kept fairly low.Overall, a good introduction to the subject and enough information provided to launch into your own independent study of some of the concepts introduced.",4
51901,I appreciate the video vignettes and e-enactments as part of the instruction. Many are tongue-in-cheek (on purpose) and enliven the learning process.,4
51903,"As non-education major, presenting the approaches using a historical timeline is helpful. This way, it was easier to see the weakness of each approach although it could get quite confusing at times because a few approaches have significant overlaps.",4
51908,"Some of test questions are vague and create a kind of misunderstanding. I hope this will be considered as a frienly advice, not a claim.",4
51911,"The course is perfect . If my friends need this kind of classes , I would recommend this one. But not efriends around me",4
51930,"Excellent presentation, enough information to get a basic idea.",4
51934,"I really enjoyed the creative way the theories were presented. Some of the presentations seemed a bit repetitive unnecessarily, like in the Angel and Devil debates.",4
51935,Good until now. Thank you,4
51965,"Excellent Course! It taught me that I can take good things from the ""bad"" methodologies from the past.",4
51971,"Very informative course. It helped me to get a systematic view on SLE theories. Yet I wish the course was a bit longer and less dense, for the lack of a better word. Too much information was squeezed into very short modules.",4
51973,Dr. Dixon really knows how to teach stuff. Excellent.The reason I give it 4 stars is because it could give us some real examples of in-class applications of all the useful techniques taught. It would really help us enrich our inventory of teaching techniques.,4
51991,"Not happy...the peer review assignments people choose to comment but not grade, honestly I think the tests are enough to show understanding of concepts and approaches.",4
51995,"It seems staff do not monitor, or address, issues posted repeatedly to the forum, especially in regards to the final test (part 2 of the specialty). The content of the course is great, and if someone with the authority to make changes when errors are detected and reported did care for the course I would have have rated the course higher.",4
52002,Interesting content. Interesting delivery.,4
52005,It would really been helpful if you provided some readings for each approach. I could do outside readings but as you know you can find lots of readings which might be not useful for a beginner.The final test was not close by to being easy even though I did study. Thank you for that and that's a good job giving us a challenge to look forward to.,4
52020,"An interesting and informative course, like it.",4
52030,"Extremely interesting topics; it is a quick and broad survey, so very superficial, though. Just a series of 10-15 minutes presentations introducing each aspect of the field. Don't be discouraged if you find the first week's presentation lacking/unengaging: it gets better.",4
52032,"This is a complete introduction the cognitive sciences. A great course to start with, but is still for the beginners",4
52033,Great course! Could've been longer. Looking forward to more online courses from the U of Edinburgh.,4
52034,"I enjoyed this course, however some of the lectures were a bit slow or somehow loose. Evenso, I think this is a very good introductory course to a fascinating topic.",4
52035,Great high-level overview that introduces some very interesting concepts. Great intro for those who are just exploring this area of study. Entices you to dive deeper into the topic!,4
52039,Wonderful course! It's a great introduction to the topic of embodied cognition. My only suggestion is to expand it for the people who are really interested in these topics.,4
52044,"I like the subject and the topics of each week are also interesting. However, the 4 weeks' content can only cover limited topics. And the course in Coursera can be improved by making the parts in each week clearer and reducing some subtitle mistakes.",4
52045,"I enjoyed this course very much! Provided a very fundamental framework for understanding what cognition is, and the associated problems, such as mind-body",4
52046,"Approachable, easy to follow, interesting examples, rich additional readings, good lecturers, easy exams",4
52047,"A good and informative course on the philosophy of cognitive sciences. Judging by the lectures and quizzes, the course does seem to be more on a high school level, than an undergraduate level.",4
52053,"Thank you, Dr. Chamovitz! I enjoyed this course. I did WAPK 1 a few years back as well. Please do create many more courses on plant biology - yours is the only one available on Coursera. Some feedback points: 1) Very little interaction and moderation on the discussion forums. There are many interesting points posted there, but no instructor intervention. 2) After listening to the videos i really did not enjoy the reading material provided - perhaps some other sites would be better. 3) The course syllabus is not enough to gauge whether the course is basic, medium or advanced level. Perhaps an indicator would help. For example, in Week 3 content on photosynthesis I was expecting a much more detailed discussion. It would be great to have more advanced courses from you and your team. Your overview explanations are extremely lucid and the visuals provided really help. I think that very few biology textbooks/reading material provide such a clear overview picture and link across concepts. Excellent course! 4) The concern re. GMOs is just touched upon - in such a case I think it would be good if you could take up specific queries, concerns raised in different countries and share your view on those. For example, Bt Brinjal in India. 5) I love the lab visits! Thank you again for this course!",4
52062,i think this is very good course and the teacher was excellent through out the course,4
52071,I would like to thank the course instructor and coursera for such an incredible course . It has truly helped me understand the plants biology and life process.,4
52086,"The presentation and content of lectures were compelling, motivating and disturbing. Very well done. No one really responded on the forums. This may have been because of small class size. In other classes I have taken on coursera the forums are quite active, and an instructor weighs in from time to time to answer questions or be present. Assignments were peer graded, so much was gained from reading other students interpretation of the material.I suggest putting the additional reading lists at the end of each unit, or in a separate side bar. They were hard to find in the syllabus.Overall an extremely worthwhile course.",4
52087,Foundations for Global Health Responders offers an introduction to global health issues tailored for those interested in global health missions. The course includes video presentations and discussions by numerous physicians associated with the University of Colorado School of Medicine as well as several other subject-matter experts. I found the presentations and supplemental materials helpful in gaining a basic understanding that I can expand upon in the future. Well worth your time if you are interested in participating in global health missions but are not sure what area you might like to focus on!,4
52089,The course contents and arrangement of topics are easy to understand.,4
52090,"Overall, the course provides useful information and a great framework through which to consider the topic of persuasion and influence. I wish the course came with direct references throughout the video that linked to specific studies and evidence. However, the professor did reference those studies even if he didn't provide the links, so that's a good start.",4
52095,How can you not learn AND love Dr. O'Keefe!,4
52104,Could have included some assignments. The explanations and examples were very clear.,4
52108,Interesting course! Simple but useful material.,4
52112,"The course is very short and can easily be finished in a few hours. That said, the information contained is golden and opened up a new way of looking at persuasion.Still, the course would benefit greatly from more real world examples and case studies.",4
52113,"The course provides a good framework to deal with business problems. It is very simple, but effective.",4
52122,Brief but worthwhile experience. I gotta say: I'm developing an interest in Northwestern University.,4
52123,Clear and useful.,4
52125,Short course with some good ideas and examples.,4
52126,A short yet informational course. Good informational density for such a short course.,4
52128,"Good course, very well structured and understable materials",4
52133,"MUY BUEN CURSO, LO RECOMIENDO MUCHO, DEBES TOMARTE TU TIEMPO EN LA SEMANA PARA ESTUDIAR YA QUE TODO ES MUY INTERESANTE.",4
52151,Excellent guidance for new or seasoned teachers.,4
52162,I enjoyed the course. It was very useful for my own lessons,4
52164,good way of teaching english,4
52169,"Great insight, good examples and practical tasks",4
52208,"Not so guided as the previous ones. And this one is harder. But still great content, well organized, great teachers.",4
52221,"clear, well guided and inviting. Thank you for such a great work teaching teachers ;-)",4
52230,Helpful material and a really manageable pace. Cleverly presented.,4
52234,More narratives and examples should be there in the videos that can demonstrate explicit connection between the lesson plan templates and the lecture video talks.,4
52245,"This is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning. It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course. I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentational style of the instructor. Don't let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent. For those who have followed the earlier courses in the specialization, I should warn that this one is much more difficult, particularly for those without prior teaching experience, and far more practically based.",4
52250,The course is really interesting and usefull. Congratulations.,4
52257,I loved it!,4
52264,Initially a little misunderstanding on the differentiation needed by the overseers of the course to relate to the diverse backgrounds of the participants. Formats and personal adaptations became more mutually understood and accepted. Course ended in strong accordance. The re-enactments and vignettes are excellent!! (and goofy--on purpose). This was the strongest component of the three so far.,4
52267,"I enjoyed this course very much and have NEVER had so much fun learning. The only thing driving me nuts was that I couldn't find anything in my notes or even on the web on one of the researchers mentioned in the final test. Dumping my grade. Hated that and would have wished you'd mention something so relevant in the summary in case someone had taken wrong notes or misunderstood during lectures.Otherwise: looking forward to working with you again!Thank you to the whole team.Feel free to connect or get in touch anytime. www.vegan-translator.comAll the best,Nicole",4
52270,"It's such a nice good Course. It focuses on the essentials of Lesson Design and Assessment. As a novice English Teacher, I'd highly recommend this course.",4
52281,A well designed course that gives great information and window into better teaching,4
52285,Excellent in content and delivery!!!!,4
52292,"Foolish quiz answers, seemingly plagiarized assignments, dead forums, in my opinion, make this a less than satisfactory specialization. Great lessons, excellent presenters, and 'sticky' information - well, that makes this course worth its' cost, and it is well worth looking into. I imagine it will become better with age - this is the first iteration so don't let my fours stars dissuade you from exploring this specialization further. I am looking forward to part 2.",4
52306,"what a golden opportunity given by' almighty' coursera to train teachers to rather become professional teachers !!!.....wow coursera, you are perfectly the best .",4
52320,Though my educational background is not economics but I have taken this course out of my interest about Korea and made the right choice. I have enjoyed the course very much and learned a lot.,4
52323,I like it a lot. I wish though that this website was better flowing with the lectures. I have to refresh multiple times to make sure the video is where it should be...idk how to explain it.,4
52326,Thank you for offering this wonderful introductory course to understand Korea and Asia economy. I hope there will be an advanced course after this course.,4
52328,"The content was pretty good and the class was intuitive and exciting.The responses on the forums, however, have dropped dramatically. I had to raise 3 different threads on the forum for very specific questions but nobody from the staff ever even addressed them.I don't want to give a lower rating, because the course itself is amazing, but the forums need to be read/responded by staffers if we expect the students to learn the most the course has to offer.",4
52333,I learned a lot - I look forward to it being updated to Swift 3 - I'll take it again then.,4
52334,Improvement over the first course. Most of the material did not require many references to the apple documentation in order to complete the assignments. Final project was comprehensive and built on previous work. A major flaw of this course is that it is not updated for the newest version of Swift. Many of the techniques and methods taught will not translate to Swift 3.0.,4
52335,"Good to understand, in special, xcode tool. Also, some of iOS features like autolayout.",4
52340,"Better than the previous course in terms of structure and content, still think more practice exercises for each week would be beneficial beyond just copying the video.",4
52342,The videos have been super helpful. I also think the assignment is pretty good.,4
52356,"I didn't like and I couldn't take advantage of the videos of Mike Spears. As he doesn't write a line of code and has all the examples with snippets or just added in the project, it's quite difficult to understand the ""programming process"". The rest of the videos are really nice! Good work :)",4
52359,"Great aproach, but when the coding sample are explained the Teacher do it so fast and I think we need more why answers!",4
52365,"Quizes could have better questions, it seems they don't always test what was taught in the week.",4
52369,sometime i cannot catch up with Jack,4
52374,Great Course. Learned a lot. Thank you,4
52375,You still haven't allowed for the users to download the video lessons in HD nor there's a transcript of the classes as there are in Android courses.,4
52382,It really did help me to understand everything. I did not give 5 stars because the sound of some videos is bad,4
52386,Good course,4
52393,Pretty exciting. I found several improvements compared to course 1. Jack or Parham should take part in discussions I guess.,4
52401,Good introduction for someone who has zero knowledge on architecture,4
52417,Very good lectures. Some of the tests could be improved. Monitors should also be more present and follow through the questions more closely.,4
52424,"A very well presented course, giving a reasonable understanding of the GFC.",4
52427,Good and clear explanation on Global Financial Crisis by Prof. Metrick which was supplemented by the perspective of former Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Prof. Metrick also gave a good overview into the ongoing Eurozone crisis. However discussion forum isn't too active probably due to fewer number of course participants.,4
52435,"An extremely helpful and informative course, with very detailed and well-structured content.",4
52443,"Very good, well-paced course. It will help you grasp the complexity of the structural issues that triggered the Global Financial Crisis, which rocked the world. I would suggest you complement it by reading some of the many books that have been written about it, say, ""Too Big to Fail"" (Andrew Ross Sorkin), ""The Big Short"" (Michael Lewis) and, of course, ""Stress Test"" (Timothy Geithner).",4
52444,Really worthy for a financial individual.,4
52453,"A strong overview of the crisis that balances the depth and breadth of the material well.Strengths:Balance of narrative and data.Logical sequencing gives a nice structure and a more digestible package.Excellent level of detail, neither missing the forest for the trees nor ignoring the trees altogether.Weaknesses:Does not address alternative theories or interpretations of the crisis, even to shoot them down.Several quizzes were poorly-constructed, featuring obvious typos or nonsensical statements.Additional module to update the material (stale since mid-2015) was promised, but not delivered.",4
52463,"Very interesting course that provides a comprehensive, yet accessible, account of the global financial crisis as well as of its causes and consequences. Both Prof. Metrick and Mr. Geithner do a great job in explaining the materials using clear slides and easily understandable graphics and figures. The course setup is also clear and can easily be completed. The quizzes offer a good opportunity to keep track of the course contents (maybe extend them to 3-4 questions instead of just 2?). Perhaps a comprehensive final exam reviewing the materials of all prior weeks would be sensible, as one might have forgotten what topics were discussed in week 1 or 2 while learning the contents of week 11.",4
52475,Learned quite a lot! The course was structured very good.,4
52479,"This course gives an easy to understand and detailed look at what happened during the financial crises. The material is very detailed and contains charts, quotes from the time and some personal experiences.",4
52480,"I didn't expected so clear explanations.Well, my impression is that the instability still exists and this is in the circular dependencies that can exist in the new system. Once the mechanisms get fast enough the crisis may appear.There is some parallel with computer systems. In the early days of the interconnected computers the problems were much similar. I hope I could write something until the end of the course.I would like to have some more schematic explanation of the institutions and the flow of money and the other financial products. As well as some textbook references. It is a little bit complicated to the non-american to enter fluidly at least in the set of abbreviations.",4
52490,I will be great if you provide learners with additional material worth to read.,4
52498,"Excellent comeback on the crisis and the elements why, how and what has been done. Also a good overview of the outcome for European countries.",4
52501,"Very good course, very good professors; no community assistants for answering in the discussions.",4
52509,"I enjoyed the course very much. It was clear, it included the explanation of its basic concepts for anyone who was not familiar with everything, and it came with graphs that backed up many points argued. I certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to start understanding the global financial crisis. What I did not like were last 2 lessons by Secretary Geithner, which I found very general and in contract to the detailed slides of Professor Metrick. Nevertheless, this is a great course.",4
52513,Very informative and engaging course. Very good lecture presentations by two leading subject matter experts. About the only drawback was the lack of teaching assistance interaction on the course discussion forums and maybe even an occasional drop in by one of the instructors from time to time.,4
52525,Awesome course and the simplicity of demonstrating the concepts is quite good.,4
52533,Very good overview over a topical area - more in-depth exercises for testing one's own understanding might have been helpful,4
52534,very much enjoyed the course.,4
52547,A course worthy of learning and filled with valuable information,4
52548,"Excellent course. However, lots of unanswered questions of students are still pending.",4
52556,"A little long and repetitive, but very in depth. Yale is by far the best at the videos and getting guest speakers that are interesting. Definitely feel well informed about the global financial crisis and the origins of financial crises in general.",4
52559,Provides insights in macro economic decisions based on the actua,4
52565,"Outside my field, but useful course. Many thanks for setting out the unfathomable.",4
52567,Good fundamental summary of the GFC. Worth the time.,4
52568,"Despite working in financial industry, and having a very good understanding of the crisis. they way the course has been structured to disseminate the information gradually and structurally really appeals to me. I have learned things I did not know, and to me that is the",4
52578,"great course, all the knowledge can be aplied to work environment and change the vision for teams and people management.",4
52589,"It was great experience, however I would like to have little bit more then a one case study to work/ choose from.",4
52590,"As mentioned in the discussion form, it is really difficult to accept the fact ""I have a challenge to accept and I need to solve.""Leadership is not a cake walk and needs vision to become a leader and lead people.This course has helped me a lot to become a visionary leader. Thanks to every single member of this team. Great job.",4
52597,It had been an amazing experience to be the part of this CAPSTONE project. It is not a meager learning experience but a practical experience of applying whatever has been learned. Keep the good work going.,4
52605,"Challenging, though I seemed to do more than was required. Great course.",4
52616,"The amount of learning in this module is huge! If you have never worked with HashMaps and don't know what this is, you may spend quite a bit of time trying to understand. That time will probably be spent reading material external to the course.",4
52618,Excellent course to learn about Structured Data. Challenging exercises and quizes.,4
52631,Thank you for the course. The professors explain things with great enthusiasm and artistry. The main topic of the course - breaking ciphers is very interesting for me. Because of this interest I was completely involved into the course.Thank you again!,4
52640,"I liked this course, because it was very well focused on one area of Java (Data Structures) and not focused on some specific library. However, I wish they didn't rely so much on their custom classes (readers, parsers), instead they could have explained how they work, so we could learn about Java native readers, parsers. Overall, however, I am very satisfied.",4
52655,The homework is too time consuming.,4
52669,Great course. Learning Java Data Structures and Cipher encryption was fun.Good material and problems,4
52670,Week 2 was wayyy too difficult but everything else was just right.,4
52672,"The course is ok, but some lectures seems to be too slow paced, while the programming assignments tend to be difficult for a beginner programmer, since some issues are not covered in the lectures.",4
52685,Very detailed in each step.,4
52689,It is very well designed course. My only problem is that you cannot submit answers to the weekly quizes if you are only auditing the course.,4
52699,Great Course including great compilation of concept and question.,4

52750,"Definitely learned a lot but the exercises could have been a bit more involved.It's also too easy to get away with submitting blank essays, but I suppose that's to the loss of the student.",4
52755,I loved this course! There was so much to learn!,4
52759,"I took this course simultaneously with Course 1 in the certificate specialization. As a result, I think I confused concepts from both courses in trying to fulfill assignments. Also, I did not think there was enough time to conduct two 5- session coaching assignments, and, as a result, I had to finish the assignment on the second go-round because I had a hard time scheduling the coachees for more than one or two sessions.I did get a lot from the course and especially some guidance on how to go about coaching folks in a more cohesive manner that did not feel like a touchy-feely experience. Thank you.",4
52760,Little hard because of lots of discussion session.,4
52765,"Excellent, was very practical and useful for immediate everyday application",4
52766,Very useful and inspiring! <3,4
52767,"Very informative, balanced, and has great scientific content supporting the coaching lessons. Top notch on content, but could use more interactive systems and more dynamic lesson practices.",4
52769,"Good course, gave it four rather than five starts because:The discussion boards were too prescriptive which did not lead to any open discussions.The videos referred to course material that was not always there.On the plus side, I found the course material useful and well structured. The personal journal was an essential part of the course and it should be emphasized as such. Without it I would not have learnt as much.",4
52773,i came to more about china this is useful for me to do international business thank you !,4
52777,"This course was unique in several ways. It covers a subject from WWII and Jewish history that is largely overlooked. The lectures were interspersed with video that added a unique flavor. The students seem to come from a variety of countries. As a student, some of the lecture material was difficult to understand, though presented in English; subtitles helped. If there is a complaint of deficiency, it is the lack of support, feedback, or availability of staff on comment boards. I encountered a problem due to a mis-counting of the peer reviews completed, and a delay in my grade, so finally gave up and kept doing peer reviews until it showed as complete. The peer reviews on my own assignments were delayed. I think 4 peer reviews is too much, whether from low enrollment, language barrier or other issue. But I learned much, and this added to my current study of the role of China in WWII.",4
52778,Excellent information I was previously unaware of. Found subtitles useful as the instructor has an accent. Enjoyed photographs and music in class. Very interesting subject.,4
52780,I learned a lot in this course and highly recommend it. I lived in Tianjin for over four years and often passed the old Synagogue and wondered about its history. The videos in this series are well done and the information is just enough to be eye opening and engaging without being burdensome. I also learned quite a bit from the other participants in the course.,4
52781,good and informative presentation,4
52790,"I thought this was a very interesting course on a topic I knew nothing about. Apart from the history of the Jews in China I learnt a great deal about China in the 19th and 20th century.My only criticism of the course was the very confusing rubric for peer marking the assignments. The criteria were very specific and , in my view, didn't necessarily reflect the subject of the essay.",4
52799,Filled in many gaps in my knowledge. I had a high school friend in San Francisco whose family was part of the Shanghai Jewish community during WW 2 -- and I feel that I get his family better after taking this course. Thank you.,4
52807,Great course and great content! I really recommend it for those wanting to learn key aspect of the language for management and leadership.,4
52820,For both medical professionals and IT professionals need to take this course to understand the present and future of healthcare.,4
52827,This is a really good course. My only issue was I found some of the weeks quite a bit harder than others. It was helpful to look at the notes for each week in advance to figure out which ones would be tougher and allow for that.,4
52831,Videos to explain the materials would be much more useful than how it is right now...,4
52833,Great introduction to logic.One thing I'd have appreciated to see is a set of accompanying recorded video lectures. My experience is that I find it easier in term of efforts and faster in term of time to absorb taught concepts when I engage both my hearing and sight senses while watching a lecture than reading only.,4
52842,"Covers a broad content of Logic: Resolutional Logic, Propositional Logic, Herband Logic.Good analogies and examples from daily life, explaining where logic can be applied.You will be able to see the things more logically and (depending on you) improve your programming skills.However some topics should be fixed, there are technical problems in some weeks of the course. The lack of videos and lectures might be an issue, the written sections are not very engaging. There should be more resources and interactive tools. The exercises are challenging and demands time.",4
52844,"This has been a very interesting course, introducing the basic of logic reasoning.",4
52854,"It was very interesitng with great teachers, but for me (student of veterinary medicine) there was very little new.",4
52857,"certainly is a large scale course covering almost all the things concerned and wide variety of examples and ample amount of knowledge but more portion is focusing the health management. It will be more comprehensive if one lecture about the food processing is added, like dairy products etc. thanks",4
52863,"Make a clear description of computer operating system, concise logic and appropriate pace",4
52867,"Overall great class, however, I'd have enjoyed more quantitative exercises and problem sets.",4
52874,great course,4
52882,"The course offers clear explanations and is very well structured.. We do not get lost into technicalities, the material is straight to the point. Moreover, the videos are of great quality which makes the learning even more easy.A little disappointed by the finance approach though, which is too simple and makes very rough assumptions.One last point (and I cannot emphasize this enough) : the propose Simulator is a great learning tool.",4
52900,Good course for angel investors and entrepreneurs to understand how private equity and venture capital works. It provides a sound introduction to this very exciting topic.,4
52909,"Good course, not too difficult, but at some points i had to do a lot of digging to understand the concepts. The best part is that it encapsulates many things(not everything) of this area of financing.",4
52915,Well constructed course with a large amount of information to initiate your journey in PEI,4

52933,It's really a good course.,4
52951,Interesting and informative. A good entry-level course for those looking to get a clearer picture of the PE/VC space. I found the financial side of it a bit difficult to follow (though might just be me). Keep up the good work Universita Bocconi,4
52957,Great insight on Private Equity!,4
52959,"Very nice compilation of the concept and practices in private equity market currently.A couple of concepts/jargons which I thought should have been touched upon were pre-money valuation, post money valuation, while the actual practice of arriving at the number of shares, was explain but no reference to the jargon was made.Also some understanding on concepts of liquidity discount, small size discount and control premium should have been touched upon in case of equity valuation which is quite relevant in case of valuation in small unlisted companies.Some more elaboration in the area of role and functioning of the investment committee could also be interesting.On the whole quite comprehensive, relevant and interesting.Regards,Jumana",4
52961,I liked this course for the basics. Just wish that a few more examples were given for practice.,4
52963,very interesting and useful course. I hope that many users will find it relevant. African market and models are absent on the présentation; I appreciate the professor and the slides exercises are quite clear,4
52970,The content is amazing and is good to watch professors from outside the anglo world.,4
52975,very clear and easy to understand,4
52977,This is an excellent course for an introduction to Private Equity and Venture Capital. This was invaluable to me as an entrepreneur with hardly and business background (Degree-wise). Thank you!,4
52983,Excellent course. A must for someone who wants to gather knowledge about the Private Equity and Venture Capital sector. A big thanks to Professor Stefano for explaining all concepts with an ease.,4

53016,Nice basic course for starting a career in Private Equity. Enjoyed it.,4
53017,"It's difficult to find university courses that are more hands-on other than theoretical, which is definetely the case with this Private Equity and Venture Capital course. It helped me refresh previous knowledge, while at the same time providing insight into practical matters such as regulation, regional differences as well as",4
53020,Very good and interesting course although there was not much feedback and replies by the Unversity.,4
53022,Great course.He should mention beforehand that the slides are far more detailed than the video lectures.,4
53025,"Very good course, needs a follow up one for more depth and may be example cases on valuation and structuring syndication.",4
53037,Excellent course anybody who wants a deep understanding of the private equity sector.,4
53041,"Really enjoyed the course by Bocconi, clear, well organized, focused on important issues of PE&VC, a major theme in nowadays economic environment. I recommend this course, if you want to improve your knowledge on PE&VC.",4
53056,Excellent introduction to philosophy applied to business - this really help expand your views.,4
53059,"This course offers an excellent overview of broad philosophical concepts and their applications, mostly to situations where we have to manage change. The course material is light and presented in a clear and enjoyable manner, with interesting explanations and helpful visual aids.",4
53069,Very interesting class. Very useful.,4
53089,Very interesting course.,4
53098,Very interesting,4
53106,This course was helpful but kinda difficult to see the correlation to management skills.,4
53116,You need your way of thinking (philosophy) to have your own style.,4
53119,"Very insightfull, but gets redundant in the end (last 2-3 Courses)",4
53136,"The course was very well presented. The only bother is the peer review can take quite a long time and I had completed the course well in advance of having ""officially"" finished.",4
53137,Week 1 - changed my perception of how ideas are manifested especially in the workplace,4
53138,Luc de Brabandere's Cours was an excellent tool to discover interesting topics linking Philosophy and Management. Personally I have learned several useful things from this course.,4
53139,Lot of philosophy which wasn't really related to management.But overall a great experience. I especially like the video in which he talks about thinking in new boxes. Real practical stuff.,4

53168,"Very interesting, I follow Weisbener courses from its begining and it's still astonishing. Congrats !",4
53180,"really nice course, good explanations and easy to follow",4
53186,"Sometimes (especially in metals) they go too deep (if you are not familiar with metallurgy you may have some problems with understanding). However, even the hardest parts gave me very interesting knowledge. Some of that stuff is unthinkable! Lecturers are rather good speakers. I can recommend this course. I really enjoyed it.",4
53194,"I think this Machine Learning course quiet challenging, although many of concepts are simple but programming in Octave (Matlab - Open source version) need some dedication.",4
53196,Excellent High level overview of Machine learning topics.,4
53232,"The topics were great.Would have been nice, though, to start from scratch instead of filling in some specific functions. We end up loosing sight of the whole process.",4
53285,"A pretty cool intro to machine learning, though I'd loved to have more mathematics, I'm sure that it's made this way to match most peoples' needs, Prof. Andrew is a great lecturer",4
53287,One of the best courses I have reviewed and certainly I enjoyed completing the programming exercises. For the lectures though I have gone through Prof. Ng's original Stanford lectures in greater details. It gives anybody without any ML experience a very nice overview of the algorithm and practices.,4
53293,"With acceptable technique using in data mining, Andrew did give us some intuition in ML. Although it need to further learning on some Bayesian rules and math, but it's really worths it.",4
53325,I am getting this message that i have excced time specify to submit assignment but it still remain 3 days. i will like my account to be review and open. Thanks for providing this online platform,4
53348,more examples can be included and if assignments are in python that would be helpful as most of the high level frameworks are in python and that will build good ground work in numpy etc.,4
53366,"Great mentor, great course. Assignments need a little bit of improvement.",4
53373,Very simple and mathematically unsophisticated (which could be a good or bad thing depending on your background) but well-organised and a generally worthwhile introduction. I'd recommend watching the videos sped up to 1.5x or 2x if you're comfortable with the mathematics since the pace of the videos is otherwise too slow.,4
53446,"Prof. Ng presented an excellent machine learning introductory course, covering various topics that are the necessary foundation. Without getting into too much mathematical details, Prof. Ng managed to convey many machine learning ideas in a clear way and all the programming exercises are very well design for learning those skills. Thank you so much for making this course!",4
53454,A good course but needs to be updated and also new material has to be added.,4
53464,Course only gives an overview.,4
53467,Good course!,4
53478,"Great overview to get you started on ML.Very cool exercises in Octave. Even if you - like I - really not care to learn Octave, I strongly recommend spending time on these.The last 2 weeks are a bit vague, but also very fast to complete.Thanks for a great course.",4
53488,"A good introductory course into the realm of machine learning. This course has a very well constructed, application oriented content.",4
53512,Awesome course for machine learning. require hard work and dedication. contains all major machine learning concepts.,4
53518,The best in the market for machine learning newbies.,4
53536,"Fantastic course! You have managed to pass on to others what you have learnt through mountains of time consuming research and experience. Your tips and tricks were brilliant. The assignments were challenging while at the same time gave a lot of help to students. My constructive criticism is possibly doing more Octave/Matlab example coding as part of your slides. As in walking through an entire exercise talking about what you would be thinking as you went through the problem and the steps you would take to complete it as efficiently as possible. Once again, great course and good luck with changing the world for the better in the future.",4
53548,Great course delineating all the fundamental principles. Some parts of it maybe a bit too easy for people with decent linear algebra knowledge but definitely a comprehensive and worthwhile introduction in the exciting topic of Machine Learning. I'm definitely motivated to learn more !,4
53556,With excellent and detailled explanations.,4
53589,It was a great experience for me learning from here.Basics are really well explained.Now I have a good understanding of Machine learning.Thanks a lot.,4
53617,"First off, I think the course content is amazing! I really like that the instructor used Matlab that encourages the user to create vectorized solutions to the problems. I have heard many negative comments regarding the lack of use of Python, R, or some other library like Cafe or TensorFlow, but I believe all of that should follow after having the mathematical background to understand these principles. The content is not easy, and requires a fair bit of mathematical sophistication, but not so much to lose me, and hard enough to keep me engaged. I really enjoy how each learning unit builds off of the previous one, for instance, linear regression become logistic regression which becomes a neural network.That being said, I really think that this course needs to have a fresh coat of paint on it. I believe it was filmed in 2008. I don't think the content really has been revamped since its release. The recordings look like they were filmed on an old web cam, not even as good as a modern iPhone. The slides should have some design work on them. I know it seems petty to stress over the presentation, but I think many people are turning to programs from Udacity that are very flashy, but not as technically rigorous mainly, I feel, just because of the presentation. I think that this course deserves a bit of energy polishing it up since it's still perhaps the most popular MOOC course out there.",4
53634,"I really enjoyed this course. I believe it gives a great basic understanding of what machine learning is and how you can use it. I feel that the programming assignments could be broken up a little better to assess each section the way the PDF suggests to submit the results. Or at least give an option to bail out of the code if you know you haven't completed the other sections. Overall, I am very satisfied with the information provided and the instructor's teaching style. I look forward to learning more on Coursera.",4
53664,"The course material is great and its an awesome starting point for data analysis. However, its very unfortunate that the assignments are in Matlab / Octave. It's very important to study Python for interviews, as that is the most popular language with excellent data science tools. Also, the Octave environment is not the most stable and I often encountered problems. I wish Professor Andrew Ng had taken industry needs and data science needs into consideration while selecting the platform.",4
53690,The course definitely enhanced my knowledge about the subject to a greater level and inspired me big time to get into the core of the subject and start working on the implementation of the tools and algorithms in real life applications. It would have even better if more of practical applications are dealt with the course.,4
53708,"I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning. The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quizzes and programming assignments; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it, what I'm doing wrong, or sometimes I don't even know what the question wants me to do. However, with perseverance, I was able to get through every one of them.",4
53738,"This was a great intro into Machine Learning. My only complaint is that it was very heavy in mathematical theory. While that is a necessity for the industry, I would have liked to see more examples of practical applications and implementations with modern technologies and libraries.",4
53742,Great course.,4
53746,"While I had som familiarity with the concepts from before, I would sincerely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn how to implement machine learning. Do not however that the course expects a lot from you in terms of mathematical knowledge.",4
53751,I would be much better if it would have included the more layman explanation.,4
53766,Good introduction to machine learning. Well Done,4
53768,I have joined on recommendation by my company associates.Its worth as course is designed step by step learning.,4
53780,"Great course, although it might help to provide more detailed info for people who know calculus and algebra bascs.",4
53787,Thorough introduction into machine learning. Programming exercises could provide less pre-written code and require to write more functions (i.e. visualizing data) by yourself.,4
53844,"Great course! SOmetimes a bit lengthy, especially when explaning really basic concepts (which should be known by most people) but still fun to watch. Lot to learn for beginners in machine learning.",4
53866,"Five minus one star for quality of the video and general lack of programming assignment practical help. Those are minor concerns considering the wealth of knowledge, wisdom actually, and passion that Andrew Ng brings to this course few other instructors could provide.",4
53872,Great study,4
53901,"Lectures and Assignments were really good, however the quizzes are very challenging. A single question may have 4 true false questions so it is difficult to know which element you got wrong.",4
53904,This course help me to understand a little bit more about the options and how a model is build. But is a little too long for someone that is beginning. Would be good to cover less topics but more in deep.,4
53915,Pretty good introductory course for people with basic engineering or mathematics backgrounds,4
53916,Especially the first few weeks were great and the programming assignments were quite interesting.,4
53927,"An excellent overview of machine learning techniques, supplemented by programming exercises in Octave or Matlab to reinforce the concepts introduced in the lectures.",4
53954,"Teaches you concepts of regression, basics to start of with Machine Learning. Assignments could be slightly modified and applied to many real life problems. If one can find a real time project, and apply the concepts they learn from this course they can make total use of it.",4
53957,I would be a useful if this course teaches about the existing models present in Matlab/octave and not writing rigorous codes every time for analyzing data.,4
53976,"Amazing, fast paced yet instructive enough to learn.",4
54047,"Well organised, good practical exercises. I think it could be a good idea to use python as an alternative to make the programming exercises, as the ""scaffoldings"" for each one are really well prepared for the student, and it's only necessary to write a few code lines.",4
54055,The audio quality can be better.,4
54072,A very inttuitive way to understand the principles of Machine Learning. The covered material is usefull and can be used in many practical ways. I did not like so much that you need to use Octave/Matlab.,4
54093,"Firstly, an extraordinary course that's offered for free ! My heartfelt gratitude to prof. Ng.",4
54101,"Excellent level for presenting the theory. I would have spent a bit more time on the ""homeworks"" because it was quite hard to understand it. I had to use the forums, otherwise I wouldn't make it.",4
54103,"Overall, the course is very good.Positives:Great introduction to machine learning if you've previously never studied itCovers core machine learning ideas, algorithms and terminologyBeyond covering the core ideas it teaches you how to do machine learning well - avoid common pitfalls, speed up your algorithms, find the most beneficial problems to tackleI definitely feel I could take on my own machine learning project from beginning to end, based on what I've learned in this course.The course is well organised and well paced so it's comfortable to get through without getting lost.Warnings:The course was more of a time commitment than I was expecting. Keeping up with the weeks is 5-6 hours per week, which is almost adding another work day.In the first 3 months that I was registered I completed 5 lessons. I only completed the whole course by doing a binge where I completed 7 weeks in 6 days. From other friends experiences doing a binge was the only way they got through Coursera courses as well.If you are not familiar with statistics or programming I think you will have to cover a lot of outside material just to read all the mathematical notation and do the basic programming exercises.Although I manage to pass the exercises every week I'm not sure how much of the material is necessarily well embedded in my brain, rather than I just learned it for 24 hours. I think the additional exercises where Coursera has you right up your own summary of a lesson is an effective aid for retaining the material, but those didn't come up often. I would encourage Coursera to have more of those or make them part of the weekly assignments.",4
54108,"Terrific instructor, easy to follow and well paced. Covers a lot of area but the exercises are very much hand holding where your part is just plugging in a few lines of code. I've been doing modeling work for many years and this machine learning course has given me additional tools that I feel will definitely be helpful for solving future problems.",4
54137,Very well explained. I was able to follow easily. The basics are there. The tutorials were very valuable. Would be nice if the cours was updated by more modern topics like deep learning.,4
54145,"I found the assignments to be sometimes confusing (i read the description of a question, thought i was supposed to answer several steps at once, only to realise that the tasks would be broken down in muc more detail later). Once i figured out the style, it was much easier, and i would be sure to read entire assignment first. Additionally, i sometimes didnt know whether errata notes were relevant to the code i was actually using, or previous offerings of the same course.Overall though, very good! Thanks!",4
54179,"I believe the course could go a bit more in detail on the algorithms and the mathematics behind it, but overall it was a great course.",4
54181,Please add the random forest algorithm.,4
54203,"The course is well-formed, and tutored. To be able to get perfection in ML field, there should be some challenging projects, where students develop it from scratch.",4
54231,"The course is very interesting and Andrew Ng is a great teacher.It 'a shame for the bad audio (too much compression?), as well as for quizzes and programming activities that are often too trivial.However I recommend this course at those who want to explore these fascinating themes and at those who want deepen a little.",4
54232,Very good course on introduction to M.L.,4
54242,A very good course to get hands-on experience of various machine learning techniques.,4
54248,"Good course, learnt a lot from here",4
54251,"Overall good, thanks Prof. Geoffery! A bit difficult, especially there is a lot part of RBM/DBN/DBM. There could be some CNN content included in the future. Thanks.",4
54260,"More mathematical foundations could be included. Other than that, it has been hell of a lot useful for my post graduation specialization. Thank you Andrew Ng and Stanford (Y)",4
54270,"I like very much the course, I recommend it. I would have liked learned more MATLAB parallel to the course.",4
54283,"The course is nice as an introductory course to ML and set the path to learn more in the field. Many algorithms are not covered in much detail and programming assignments are also limited in terms of completexity and innovation. I think it all depends on the learner to really take skills from this couse and start applying them outside of the course to real problems, join tougher courses and dive deep into the algorithms taught in the course.",4
54291,"Great course, but with many mistakes in the materials.",4
54299,"Very good course to understand and implement a large range of machine learning solutions. The only drawback I see here is the very poor level of mathematics contained in the course (it can be seen as an advantage for some), but less time spent on explaining basic maths and some dedicated to show the demonstrations behind the formulas would have been perfect!But apart from that, the pedagogy of the course is close to perfect, Andrew makes it really logical and easy to understand ! I have spent a great time.NB: for those who find his course too slow, I found that speeding the videos *2 is a very good solution!",4
54302,It's good and informative,4
54314,"I learned this machine learning course. This is my second course about machine learning.Pros. [1] Mathematical backgrounds are well introduced. If their proof is quite long, the proof is omitted. [2] This course provides chance to construct major machine learning formulas using MATLAB/Octave. [3] Resources offered at last seem to be very useful to deepen my study on machine learning. I am going to use the references as a compass.Cons. [1] Audio quality is poor. As an English learner as a second language, this makes me spend more time to capture the meaning of speech. [2]",4
54328,"Overall I feel the depth of the information and difficulty of the assignments is well balanced for a free online course. With barely any high level math knowledge I was able to complete the course fairly quickly. Even though the notation was sometimes hard for me to read and decipher. I appreciated the explanations in text form a lot (the lecture notes and the programming tutorials). They really helped tie the whole thing together. Sometimes hints in the pdfs for the exercises would confuse me rather than help me.I think professor Ng is a good teacher. Pleasant to listen to. The explanations in most of the video were fairly easy to understand. Going over graphs and visualizing what was going on was really helpful in understanding the algorithms.I really like the practical tips as well, where it was explained how to analyze performance of an algorithm and what can be done to improve it based on clear metrics.Thanks to all those involved for creating this course. I feel I understand a lot more than I did before I started but I also know this is just the tip of the iceberg.",4
54330,Very useful introduction to machine learning concept for poeple who are completely newbie in it.,4
54348,Simply Awesomee!!!!!,4
54373,"Great course to learn the math behind the algorithms in machine learning. Not to practical, but definitely helpful to actually understand whats going on when you use a library to help you.",4
54379,"Great Course! It covers main concepts of ML with a good explanation. In my opinion, the PCA part could be improved because I used other sources to understand well some concepts",4
54387,"Extremely good overview of a large variety of Machine Learning Algorithms!The only thing that bothered me a little was that everything was done in MATLAB instead of R or Python, which is probably more natural for most people taking the course. Also, this course is rather directed at people with a programming background that want to get into stats, not so much for people with a stats background that want to get into the programming part of ML (which I was).",4
54399,good course,4
54400,"Thinking back, I also really enjoyed this course, particularly Andew Ng.",4
54415,"Everything is so great about this course, the only bad thing I can say about it is that all the errors in the videos and slides have not been corrected since the course came out.",4
54423,Interesting and useful course as for me.,4
54424,"Great course, though sadly a bit of bitrot is noticeable given the errors and poor video quality, etc.",4
54430,Very good course and handson experience for non experts. Thanks.,4
54431,"Course looks like a great introduction to the topic, now I can go forward and look what details to get deeper in",4
54435,"Some quiz questions and parts of the programming assignments seem a bit arbitrary, but the course is solid overall. I'd strongly advise making heavy use of the tutorials and test cases for the programming assignments in the resources section.",4
54439,Great!,4
54440,great- Sometimes I wondered why the true statistical terms - like factor analysis - were never mentioned,4
54444,Great course. Learned a lot.Would have liked more practical exercises rather than pre-made scripts that we edit.,4
54446,Great course so far. More examples would have been great,4
54461,"Excellent course to start off for data science enthusiasts. Only if the course was based on python programming, it would have been more relevant to industrial applications.",4
54472,"A bit too simple and the programming exercises are too written out, but I have to admit, after this course I am able to talk about these algorithms intelligently. Thank you very much kind sir.",4
54496,Good Concept wise,4
54541,Andrew Ng is Very humble. The course content was made very lucid and easier than it could have been.,4
54545,This is a excellent course. But I think that the last weeks are somewhat stuffless in details. Adding some new optional contents may be a good idea.,4
54547,Background details missing but overall fantastic experience.... :),4
54559,"Good for beginner, but somehow too simple for further study.",4
54574,Great introductory course for general audiences. There could be much more material covered in the math/technical aspect and the lab assignment could use more difficulties.,4
54580,A good first course on Machine Learning. The programming exercises are a little too easy.,4
54584,"Great course! My only quip is that there are errata on the video that I would hope would be corrected, particularly with numbers/amounts. That could really confuse some students.",4
54593,This course give the basics for Machine Learning principal algorithms. It is very clear.,4
54598,"For a student major in Literature, this video turns out to be very interesting and insightful, besides it is not too difficult.",4
54634,"It's a great course, just not one that can be completed in 12 weeks with a full time job, family and other comitments",4
54637,"Amazing Course, teaches you right from basics. Prof. Ng explains everything in a manner which makes it easy to understand. Only one shortcoming I found in this course is, not challenging enough programming exercises. I understand that course has to cater a general and large crowd, but adding maybe a few optional challenging exercises might help. Also, if optional video content is provided for algorithms which have been taught in CS229 but are absent here, it will be really useful.",4
54675,"Fantastic topic, even for people not directly working in programming.I'm in marketing and wanted to know more about the possibilities behind this specialty. The course is definitely challenging but manageable with some efforts, and worth doing it.",4
54692,"Great content, great slides, good examples.However, even though Dr. Ng takes time to explain the fundamental concepts and length and repeats multiple times, when it comes to complex topics, he glances over them. I ended up referring to external (Dr. Hinton, for instance) for deeper understanding.",4
54696,"Great insight. However, the treatment of SVM (Support Vector Machines) was a bit too light for my tastes.",4
54723,Would have given it five stars if there were some materials or pointers to the latest and state of art deep learning.,4
54730,"great lectures, thanks andrew. i particularly liked you silicon valley insights! sometimes the exercises were so tough, that even I with a phd in econometrics struggled... the risk is to loose a lot of time on matlab syntax... but we had great support by tom...",4
54760,Fantastic course! Highly recommend it. A really good introduction/perspective on the key details machine learning algorithms.,4
54781,"Very good overview of machine learning. Doesn't go into detailed mathematical construction of the methods/techniques but the course does provide you with the overall/big ideas used in machine learning. If you are completely new to machine learning, definitely take this course! If you're from a different background (math/stat etc), this course will provide you with a good transition into machine learning.",4
54782,A complete end to end application of machine learning would make us more confident after completing the course.,4
54802,Great introductory course. I wish there was more content in Week 10 and 11 with practical assignments.,4
54807,The homework grading is a bit finicky but otherwise a great course,4
54818,This is a very interesting and rewarding set of lectures from a very knowledgeable and kind guy. Love it,4
54825,Almost perfect for beginners. There are some glitches in some assignments but I hope that they will be fixed.,4
54828,The course was really helpfull for understanding machine learning concepts and application.,4
54842,"The course content is awesome, and lectures are easy to understand.",4
54847,Best Machine Learning Tutorials for beginners,4
54851,"The course is really great to understand machine learning from scratch! Videos are really instructive and the many quizzes and exercices are well thought. The only (small) inconvenient is that sometimes the learner spend a lot of times explaining some basic concepts making the video a little long. Still, I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about machine learning!",4
54863,"The starting point for anyone who wants to learn machine learning , but need to continue immediately with a specialised courses on R, SAS or Python. Otherwise whatever learn in the course will disappear",4
54884,"Very good introduction into the field of machine learning, its various algorithms and use cases. Only point of criticism would be that the level is sometimes a little lower than expected. The pace of the lecture could, in my opinion, be a little faster as I found myself skipping through the videos from time to time hopping over the repetitions. Having said that, it's perfect for everyone without a mathematics background!The exercises were very good fun and very well managed through the available material, resources and the discussion forum. At the end of the course one - me anyway - wishes to go back to uni and start studying computer science.",4
54886,"A great introductory course that is designed such that you don't need a mathematical background in order to understand the concepts. Due to its attempt to maximise accessibility, most concepts are not mathematically motivated, meaning that a person serious about pursuing this as a career will need to do a subsequent course that is more mathematically rigorous. However, it does a great job of building intuition about the algorithms and is a solid base to build on.",4
54901,"Very good. Only downside : tries too much to be understandable to everyone no matter its mathematical background. So that Eventually for those with deep background in math, the lesson is very often confusing because of the lack of a clear mathematical model behind.",4
54927,Great course.I would have liked to have Octave exercises on week 10 and week 11.,4
54933,"A fairly tough course, but you don't get stuck for too long in quizzes and assignments. Quite demanding in math. I'm glad I spent the time doing the course thoroughly.",4
54952,I'm half way through the course and I find it very interesting. It is complex but doable.,4
54955,The course is great. The only challenge for me was to get any help from the course mentors.This was also a great platform to interact with some of the co-learners!,4
54975,"Congratulations for the course! I really liked to learn all the topics about machine learning, but unfortunately it could have more topics like deep neural networks and Knowledge Discovery in Databases(KDD). Besides this, the course could accept code submissions on R language.",4
54978,Very informative and a good course,4
54986,Excellent beginner course. It would b nice if we could finish off the course with one project that helps us develop a machine learning application end-to-end.,4
54995,Good intro to ML!,4
55000,"Mistakes in lecture slides sometimes too confusing. But really good overall.Content is actually amazing. Very complete and organised. Loving the progression.So helpful!(Would 4.5/5, really.)",4
55005,This is a great course for the beginners of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The contents are quite comprehensive and inspiring. The most important is that all the assignments are delicate and well-designed. Highly recommend!!!,4
55016,"A very well put together course, only slightly marred by poor audio recording. Would recommend to anyone interested in the concepts of machine learning.",4
55037,Very good course. Very practical and to the point.,4
55040,"Great course! Provides an excellent understanding of the possibilities of machine learning and key details to choose the correct analysis/project design. Only frustrating thing is that programming assignments can be quite frustrating in a way that isn't really furthering your understanding of machine learning. Of course, this is probably mostly due to the nature of programming.",4
55051,"Fantastic course. Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations. The course itself is very math-intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning, rather than just a code-based approach. I feel like this is useful, but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra (primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms). My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points, but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months. I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace.",4
55056,"Great course, and my first experience with an MOOC. I learned a lot, and am already brainstorming ways to apply it.",4
55060,"Great course for those eyeing for a quick know-how. Wouldnt recommend it to those particularly interested in learning the mathematics behind the algorithms. Prof Ng is undoubtedly a great teacher, makes the concepts look simple and easy to understand. In short, I d rate 5/5 as an engineer and 4/5 as someone interested in the math.",4
55068,"Very complete course, with a lot of theory notions and practical exercises.But the material needs to be updated and revised with the errata",4
55071,"Great at giving a fundamental, necessary understanding of machine learning. The quiz system drove me crazy--not as helpful at reinforcing understanding. Big value is in the programming assignments--helped much more to reinforce understanding.",4
55089,Great lessons for start learning Machine Learning concepts (and not so beginner concepts). Great materials to review during/after the course.,4
55091,Nice course which gives the high level picture of ML,4
55096,"Personally I didn´t have experience about ML. The course is didactic and helps to understand lots of concepts. Nevertheless, I strongly suggest to improve scripts since there are some issues to upload homeworks and even there is an answer within the forums, should be a good idea to fix this.",4
55148,This course is helpful for the one who are new in this field,4
55152,"Too easy ... but otherwise good! The programming assignments do a bit too much of the work for you, but solve some pretty interesting practical problems.",4
55156,"As a newcomer to the topic, I found the course extremely helpful and insightful. Although, it would be better if the assignment problems and projects are extended (i.e. more assignment problems) and are less spoon fed.",4
55164,"A good popular-level introduction to basic, classical concepts of machine learning. Provides intuitions without going into any mathematical depth or serious programming.",4
55175,very nice course which explains the basic theoretical concepts and implementation ideas,4
55197,Great course with directions from Andrew about what to start with in Machine learning.A more comprehensive course with pattern recognition in general could however be devised.,4
55217,Best.. but why its not providing certificate.,4
55224,homework is too easy,4
55242,One of the best machine learning courses i have enrolled for,4
55246,This is the one of the good courses i encountered online on Basic Machine learning techniques.Course is thorough with its easy programming assignment which i think could be more involved.Cheers!!,4
55260,Good introduction to machine learning with many examples and assignments.,4
55269,So far... very good course,4
55285,These lectures help me learn the basic knowledge about machine learning!,4
55295,"This course is great at covering the fundamentals of Machine Learning at an intuitive level and not going heavy on Mathematics of it. When it comes to the example assignments though, I prefer the hands on approach of the Udemy course Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science. I guess I just do not like Octave somehow and prefer the Python approach coming from an Embedded/Programming background. Taking both the courses side by side is just perfect for getting started with Machine Learning and covers both theoretical and practical aspects for starters like me. Anyways hats off to Mr. Andrew for this course. Thank you.",4
55302,A worthwhile ML course. Could be shortened to 8 weeks.,4
55326,"Really nice course, not too difficult. The perfect first step into machine learning! Enjoyed it.",4
55329,Nice teaching,4
55350,"Audio quality low, sometime is difficult to understand what it is said.The course, anyway, is a lot of value.",4
55352,"Really well explained and accessible, could even be a bit more complex or at least more detailed concerning theoretical guarantees of machine learning at some points.",4
55356,This is a great introduction to an topic which has a lot of practical application. I found it challenging but rewarding.,4
55398,"The contents of the course are well structured and clear. The assignments are interesting and provide motivation. The audio and video quality is quite bad, and it would be great if the redo it some day.",4
55421,It is a good course with clear explanation. I recommend it.,4
55422,"Best course about Machine Learning I have seen so far. All the explanations are perfectly clear, it really helps. The only bad part is the audio quality which is unpleasant.",4
55423,"Great, well structured course. The video quality and editing leaves something to be desired at times, but overall I'd recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the topic.",4
55449,Great!!,4
55468,"This course was a very useful overview of machine learning. It did not go too in-depth which could potentially disappoint some students, but it did a great job at introducing a complex and wide topic.",4
55492,Very interesting - the quality of the videos can seriously be improved though. Already with little effort by editing away the duplicate parts.,4
55497,Amazing style of teaching.. very impressed with Mr. Andrew Ng... Overall a very good course.. recommended to all Machine Learning aspirants..,4
55511,"Great course to gain hands on experience with machine learning algorithms and gain insight into mechanics of lot of applications around you using machine learning such as self driving cars, image recognition, voice recognition, image compression etc.",4
55522,"Very good , but lack of mathmatical proof .",4
55531,"Like the way instructor kept it simple yet informative, deliberately avoids unnecessary terminology. Quizzes and assignments help in understanding the ideas put forth in lectures. Would have been even better if we had a final project longer/tougher than assignments.",4
55532,"Very good course overall, but it does need some cleaning up. Lots of small typos and errata have been documented in both the lectures and the homework assignments. There seems to often be inconsistent row/column formatting of X and/or theta in the homeworks versus the lecture notes which creates unnecessary confusion. Although it is possible for the student to browse around multiple areas to piece together the puzzle, given that the course has been around for several years I feel that there should be a cleanup and reconsolidation of things to save students time. But yeah... given that you can take this course for free... it's pretty badass :)",4
55549,"This is a basic course that will provide good fundamentals in ML. If you are already a student with advanced degree in Mathematics/Engg or a professional with decade of experience might find the class a bit slow. However, it was well worth it.",4
55554,The content is somewhat easy. Adding more in-depth analysis and concepts would be really helpful.,4
55584,A very good experience till now.,4
55595,Great Course.,4
55614,this will definetly give you an idea on what machine learningn is. but you need to learn a lot more if you want to be good at it. but this is some good material to start with.,4
55623,A comprehensive introduction to machine learning.,4
55662,The content is great. Course was engaging and highly informative.,4
55663,"A lot of content was taught in a very well organized and time saving manner. From teaching point of view, the course was outstanding. But, most of the tasks in assignments were already implemented which was not beneficial from learning point of view. Hence, 4/5.",4
55685,"Great practical insights, a relatively slow-paced course so that you can easily deepen your knowledge. Mr. Ng is a genius and a very good lecturer for sure. I only had problems with the audio/video quality sometimes.",4
55693,"The course provides a good overview of machine learning methods. I would enjoy it more if it was a bit more friendly to those who actually know some math, as it could provide better understaning and insight about why and not how the methods actually work. I would also appreciate if programming exercices were a bit more complete and language agnostic. Otherwise I really like the style of professor Ng. Thanks for the course.",4
55705,"Great course....good job!If you could remove the small errors, this would become close to perfect work.",4
55711,This course is very suitable for beginner in the field of Machine Learning.It help me to understand some basic knowledge in this filed.Thanks very much!,4
55718,Very good introduction into the practical aspects of machine learning. It's also great that students can work with a free Matlab version for the duration of the course.,4
55740,"I thought, looking at the syllabus that the course will be somewhat easy for me with previous Econometrics training at graduate level. It turned up to be on par with the pace I could take it (about recommended time 1-2 hours video, 3 hours programming a week, sometimes more for exercises), and provided quite a few new insights and accessible, very intuitive introduction to many methods, algorithms, and approaches in Machine Learning. While initially I thought it was unfortunate for Andrew to have glossed so many times over details (while explicitly apologizing), I realize that that is inevitable choice between breadth and depth. At the end I would agree with the balance chosen.For my taste, I still miss the approach of mainstream Econometrics of treating every model as hypothesis (which is in the name of function in this class, but not more than that) but then testing it with the data at hand, and having a chance at rejecting it at certain level of statistical significance -- I believe not having this misses the significant chunk of scientific approach. I realize the goal is automation of much of human work in this process, but I still do not feel the balance is found. Miss any formal statistical assessment of the goodness of fit, like R-squared. At the same time I realize that I may still need to reconcile some mainstream training with new techniques.Would definitely recommend this class a really good introduction with good balance of depth and breadth to get you on the fast lane to learning the Machine Learning. Not sure if that makes you an expert -- but gives you a really good, sizable first step in that direction.",4
55752,"Content was enjoyable and accessible. Videos helped a lot. Transcriptions were pretty poor, and there are a few of bugs here and there in the code, videos, and slides. However, in the end the difficulty and depth of the course is great. For the committed student, you'll walk away with a lot of practical knowledge (if you take notes.",4
55786,Quite good. I learned a lot of concepts of ML. Hope Dr. Ng can explain things clearer and more concise sometimes.,4
55788,Further specific mathematical proof should be needed.,4
55817,"Interesting stuff, and quite comprehensive. However, the programming assignments on a ""fill here"" basis does not really lead to a generalization of the required algorithms to perform ML.",4
55852,"I wish it could have been a bit more challenging, especially towards the end of the course.",4
55855,Effective introductions and lead-in to the fundamentals and theories so that I could get a good appreciation of what ML is about.,4
55858,"Great introduction to machine learning. Andrew Ng was very clear. Amazing that the grading couldbe completely automated. the way it was Having said that, after a while I eventually fell into a trap of treating the assignments like video games, kind of randomly guessing until ti came out right. Of course that's how I program sometimes anyway(!).",4
55865,"The course, although simplistic, teaches the essential basics of machine learning with solid examples and projects.",4
55866,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. First, the positives: I got a great overview of many machine learning topics and learned a lot in general, the professor is excellent, and the programming assignments have plenty of resources to expand your knowledge beyond the core requirements. However, in later weeks, as the assignments grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustrating, are necessary to cement your skills. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasn't necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transposing matrices. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution. That said, if you are self motivated, there are plenty of resources to address this gap, and if you want to learn machine learning for its own sake (and not just to get a certificate), I strongly recommend you take this course.",4
55870,Great class from practical point of view. It would be great if there where more videos with derivations.,4
55882,"The course is great, but some materials have low quality. Still it is really good.",4
55897,"Great introductory course to get yourself started in the Machine Learning domain. Of course, there are miles to go before you sleep. This is just the beginning !",4
55921,This my first machine learning course and I am very satisfied with it. The bottom-up approach really helped me understand how machine learning evolve. I only cannot understand the proper action to do if I have to use data mining application as modern data mining applications provide diverse algorithms. The hands-on coding assignment is the most valuable lesson for me.,4
55931,It is a very good one thought i would have liked to have an explanation of the answers of some of the two-variable funtions questions proposed in the calculus part. Thanks a lot,4
55934,Great introduction to machine learning. Course briefly mentions many aspects of machine learning helping to develop an overall understanding of what kind of problems will require solving.,4
55940,"Thanks a lot Sir. Not only did this course made me aware about the different concepts in Machine Learning, but it also helped me to learn and understand the higher algorithms involving it's application. It's a great course for beginners.",4
55951,Pretty attractive. But a little bit complicated (many formulas).,4
55992,Plus for practical tips. A bit too little focus on the mathematics. Minus for slightly buggy lecture videos.,4
55999,"Very good course. It overviews the main machine learning systems in both ways, theoretical and practical.Maybe it lacks of a final project, but is one of the limitations of these kind of online courses.",4
56000,"A course without almost any prerequisite knowledge requirements. While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks. Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow. Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use, but it's somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and ""code-hiding"". Still, I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next.",4
56011,Awesome CourseNice way of Explaining thingsThanks Professor,4
56025,Nice overview of the basics.,4
56084,This Machine Language course is well structured and easy to learn for students who have basic knowledge of matrix and programming.,4
56091,"Good overview of Machine Learning, with many fun practical exercises",4
56095,Great course!,4
56101,"Great course. It addresses a number of topics on ML, and takes you to the point in which you can start working on ML on your own.I missed a clear path of what are the roadmap for the course, why each topic is presented when, and why is important. It's easy to get lost until you follow the reasoning of the instructor.",4
56118,Great overview of most promizing ML techniques. Just enough math to be able to use the knowledge but not too much to make the course heavy. Stimulating. Oriented to people that want to be operative on ML rahter than understand,4
56123,"Although the course is designed in a simple way ,we still need to have some prior knowledge in mathematics used in the course to understand it.",4
56129,This was a great course. The coding assignments were very instructive. The only possible improvements I see at this point are: 1) getting rid of the very wordy multiple choice questions with more than one correct answer. I can see how the idea is to make cheating hard but I didn't particularly enjoy those. 2) Having a textbook to see all technical details in one place rather than jumping around between the contents of different weeks. Thank you!,4
56136,"Really nice course, but the quizzes kind of take much from the examples presented in the lectures, so it seems to me like learning by heart would be somehow enough to get the grades. Comprehension could be more emphasized in the tests. Said another way, I found the quizzes to be rather easy (some questions were tricky, but many seemed to me rather obvious).",4
56140,This course provides sufficient knowledge to understand a lot of jargon related to ML.,4
56150,Very good training material and great teaching method used by Mr. Andrew Ng. It could be improved by having review question based on using Ocatave / Matlab scripting to make the learning more interactive and interesting.,4
56163,"I felt the assignments were a bit too easy, and it would have been good to have a final project that required putting a few things together from scratch, rather than plugging some minor solutions here and there. The course otherwise is amazing, and thank you to Dr. Ng and the course mentors for the outstanding work and effort still being poured into this course.",4
56215,Very challenging but rewarding.,4
56259,"Great course, a lot of hard work though..",4
56260,"This course teaches you a lot about how the algorithms work that most courses out there don't delve into (for example, things like alpha, the C parameter in SVM) which I think is a good way to learn about machine learning.",4
56318,"too shallow and intuitive, lack of scientific background. maybe the course is for undergraduates without any linear algebra background.",4
56321,it is great for me.But the only defect is that there is no subtitle translation on the screen...,4
56329,"Good overview, but less theory. Would also maybe be good to have had a section on starting from a problem and how to select a technique (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, etc.).",4
56330,Programming exercises are really hard and you don't find much help,4
56351,Great starting point for ML enthusiast !,4
56391,"Apparently, Andrew Ng is determined to downgrade the handicap score of this course to make it more available to a larger audience, some times at expense of rigorousness. I agree with most of the concessions, except the assumption that even calculus is not strictly pre-required. On the contrary, I believe that calculus, matrix, and probabilisitic thinking should be required for modern engineer to be qualified to work on big-data. Or, we might have conceded too much of the battleground.",4
56410,"great lessons, with very explained material.the major downside for this course is the terrible sound quality, it just can't be heard with regular speakers, you have to hear it with earspeakers, and it still not that great.",4
56412,Overall a great course. But the assignments could be more challenging.,4
56425,"Till now, the course seems to be very good and the flow is also very comfortable to follow",4
56426,"Very good material regarding machine learning, some more tutorials regarding matlab/octave need to be added",4
56428,Very interesting introduction to Machine Learning. All lecture notes are beautifully presented by Andrew Ng. I have truly enjoyed his style. Quizzes and programming exercises are good,4
56461,"Very interesting subject matter, and I learned a lot. My biggest complaint is that many of the programming exercises have errors in them that haven't been fixed, despite this course having been running for years. This always left me wondering if an incorrect output was an error on my part, or an error in the provided code. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the course as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a foundation in machine learning.",4
56464,"The couse has well organized lectures and exercises. So, you can easily understand topics and be able to evaluate results and investigate if something goes wrong.",4
56485,"Very hands on oriented, great addition to more mathematically focused lectures.",4
56494,It would have been perfect if this was in python,4
56509,I had some problems to really well understand the local optim vs global minimum and cost function at first. Really love this curse otherwise !Lot of years i din't practices maths like that :),4
56515,One of the best course on MOOC platforms. Thx and good luck.,4
56530,Very good course over all. If you know a bit about linear algebra the course can get a little borring some times...,4
56557,Very good to learn the basics and to get a good start in machine learning. I missed in-depth comprehension in mathematics but that's ok.,4
56591,"A great introduction to Machine Learning techniques. Because learners do not build assignments from the ground up, do not expect to be adept at implementing any of the tools taught here. Figuring out what had already been done required about 40% of my time solving the exercises. Some errors in the provided code are not corrected, so check the errata!",4
56599,"A bit hard,but a really good course.",4
56614,"Really nice course, in my opinion it could be some more stuff about how really SVM works,but it's great, anyway.",4
56624,i dont want the stars remained void.,4
56648,"Heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Ng and the entire coursera team on pulling off such a great introductory course. Honestly, machine learning is such a vast topic, that every nook and cranny of the internet has some opinion or the other on its methods. It can get pretty daunting for a beginner. This course is a perfect balance of theory and practice. It doesn't get too ""mathy"", nor does it get too dumbed down on it. The basic ideas, their implementations are discussed thoroughly, and Dr. Ng himself is such a smooth lecturer. A section on what to do after finishing this course would be helpful, as there are so many domains of machine learning, that it can get pretty confusing to decide. Also, I found the assignment tutorials a bit vague. Multiple times, I happened to scratch my head trying to figure what exactly the assignment in asking me to do. Clearer explanations of what to do in the assignments would be great. All in all, a wonderful course. Thanks a ton!",4
56667,Very good introduction to machine learning.,4
56677,You will learn the ML's principles.,4
56682,Great Course for beginners!,4
56686,"The course is good for initial steps in machine learning. The pace is relatively slow.I don't like that some sections are stated ""as too complicated"" and the formulas are just provided without a proof(in particular the support vector machine lecture). I doubt anyone will implement this from scratch, but IMHO just providing the formula is almost the same as not mentioning the algorithm at all. I am familiar with the related material so it was not a great deal to me but I guess if you don't know linear algebra this could be frustrating.There are some glitches in the lectures - sentences repeating. There are also some minor mistakes that the lecturer does(everyone does some I guess).The last bit I did not like is that students are forced to use octave and that parts of the lectures focus on that.",4
56721,"A joy from start to finish. Very well structured, with new goals stemming from each lecture. The course could only be improved by adding additional assignments for Weeks 10 and 11, or a Capstone project.",4
56729,"Fantastic and accessible introduction to machine learning! He expects very little math background, but still teaches a lot of helpful and easy-to-implement algorithms.",4
56746,The course presents in a very accessible way a variety of ML techniques. It is definitely a good introductory course.The programming assignments could have been harder and the quizes could have required some harder calculations in hand.,4
56748,Good intro,4
56751,"Excellent - both content and delivery wise. Thanks very much... More than certifying the course, I believe I've learned immensely from this ""not so easy"" course, and was able to related quite a lot to some of the work I did on ANNs (MLP) back in the 90s.",4
56754,Very well as introduction and more to the matter.,4
56763,A great takeoff to machine learning with small but efficient steps!,4
56768,"Great course, great teaching.If more stuff is introduced, that would be even better.",4
56777,"Thank you guys. Course is very good. I'm now really excited to work on project that use Machine Learning. Hope I find one quite soon. Providing the course for free is a really awesome thing to do. I appreciate that, but there seems to be fee charged for certification after completing the course :(.",4
56784,"Great class, I wish there was ""practice it"" with the algorithms to more familiarize yourself.",4
56790,"Very good introduction to machine learning. The content is fairly basic, it's up to you is you want to go deeper into the subject.Only one downside, the quality of videos is low.",4
56796,"Everything is perfect, except that we need to use Octave ;)",4
56820,A very good introduction to Machine Learning. Insightful and whets your appetite for more. Would like to request a little more information on applying and interpreting PCA.Thank you for a very nice time and would wholeheartedly recommend this course to others who want to know more about machine learning.,4
56824,"Great material, great instructor. The use of Octave was unfortunate, though; I regularly had problems with it crashing.",4
56831,"Could be more mathematical in places, but a nice overview of machine learning.",4
56845,"This course was a very good start to Machine learning for me. I have learned a lot, yet i think the programming assignments were too easy to do and most of the time the answer was almost given directly. I think more challenging assignments would be better",4
56848,"The course is very good,throgh taking this course,I have a general picture about machine learning .But ,there still exsists several problems,for example,the quality of the videos are low,and I am really looking forward to new version of the course.",4
56859,Excellent Course to get started with machine learning...... it may be even better if it is one of specialization course by same Instructor.,4
56870,This is a really practical course - it explains enough of the maths but doesn't require a detailed understanding of it. My only reason for not giving 5 starts is that is starting to get dated. Needs to include decision trees - random forests and xgboost - which have become popular since this course was produced.,4
56892,"Very well made, well paced. Better than majority of college courses. Some errors do pop up midway through the course that should be addressed. It can be frustrating to push through these issues sometimes but they are the only thing keeping from 5 stars.",4
56895,This class is practical and it can be the first class in M.L.,4
56910,One of the most thorough and effective online courses in Machine Learning,4
56912,Easy to understand and very nice relevant contents. Way the lectures are delivered made it much easier to understand,4
56926,It help to understand what Machine Learning is.,4
56965,A wonderful course the get the main insights on ML. Easily explained for everyone and for every background. Complete. A must have to start building in ML.,4
56979,Great course! Would've rated 5 except for the use of MATLAB/Octave.,4
57017,It would be helpful to work on a complex programming assignment at the end of the course,4
57024,Overall it's a pretty great course. I just didn't find the homework that enlightening though - but I suppose that may just be a consequence of the issues involved in formatting a MOOC.,4
57025,"Great introductory course to machine learning. There were some quirks to workout in the assignments and the course could use a refresh to make it more current (content is from 2011, I think). However, many of the learnings will build a strong foundation upon which any learner can continue into the interesting discipline of machine and deep learning.",4
57030,"I thought there was too much math and coding for my taste. But overall, the course is great.",4
57034,Good teaching and good materials to have. This is one of the best courses you could have in the Internet.,4
57038,"A really good introduction to machine learning. The course is well structured and is perfect for anyone wanting to learn more about data science and machine learning from a technical point of view, especially those who already have a working knowledge of mathematics and statistics.My only criticism is that the editing of the videos could have been a bit better.",4
57047,"This course is just awesome! Thanks Prof. NG for that.Although the course has very less and easy programming assignments, but still the theory covered is pretty vast and well- contained.",4
57059,Great course!,4
57071,Excelent. Just the assignments are sometimes not so easy to understand.,4
57081,great course,4
57086,The course is exceptional. However there are many errata that could be corrected but Coursera refuses to do so.,4
57087,"Great course, Andrew Ng does a good job at easing you into this complex subject, particularly for somebody like myself without much maths background. Looking at other video courses on the subject, I think more interactive visualisations could've been a great help, for example to gain some intuition about polynomials with different input parameters. Drawing lines on screen works, but I've had many revelations when working with the interactive tools linked from the wiki content. In some course exercises, the tutor and lecturer disagreed on the approach (e.g. vectorised vs. iterative), so the videos/PDFs were inconsistent with discussions/tutorials - a bit confusing.",4
57103,"Very well explained, but fairly mathematical, course that teaches the basics of modern day machine learning in an excellent pace.",4
57120,I think this course is quite a great one to have a general overview of the different techniques used nowadays in Machine Learning fields.,4
57124,at times oversimplified but an excellent course for all!,4
57125,at times oversimplified but an excellent course for all!,4
57130,good course for a new beginners but its also very old compared to modern developments.,4
57182,Great course!,4
57191,Classes are amazing. Exercises could be a little bit tougher.,4
57195,"This course introduces some basic concepts of machine learning. Particularly, neural networks and regularized regression are given a decent coverage. Some popular techniques such as decision trees and ensemble learning are not touched at all.It's a very well thought out course. The only reason I didn't give it 5 because it's in archival mode, i.e. Professor Ng doesn't support it anymore, doesn't participate in discussions, for instance. It was disappointing. Also, the assignments were too easy, in my opinion. I'd like them to be more challenging.",4
57200,Would be great to see more detailed mathematical explanation.,4
57203,"This course is really amazing in every way, very clear, understandable, and pretty usefull.Only one bad point : nothing about decision tree learning.",4
57208,It's fantastic from the root !!!,4
57220,the course is very easy to understand and implement.,4
57242,Great course. Would do it again.,4
57247,"great one,",4
57263,"Excellent course, easy to understand and very well paced. Would suggest everyone to take this course. Not much of knowledge in coding is required and anyone can do the assignments.",4
57272,"Very accessible course, with a wide variety of topics. It provides a good introduction to ML. The pacing of the course is good, and somewhat faster than e.g. WU's machine learning specialization (where linear regression and classification take up an entire module, instead of one lecture). In that sense, this course may be a particularly good fit for people that already have some working knowledge of statistics and (statistical) programming. Also, Andrew Ng is a very good and inspiring professor.In the programming exercises, there is a lot of emphasis on vectorization, which is very useful. However, once you've wrapped your head around that concept, many of them sometimes seem a little too straightforward to implement. Nonetheless, the applications are very cool, including e.g. computer vision and anomaly detection. The (free) software (Octave) is very intuitive and easy to use.All in all, an excellent course. If only there was an ""intermediate ML"" follow up by professor Ng.",4
57276,Excellent course material and lectures by Prof Ng.Perhaps the theoretical content could be increased a bit.,4
57292,Nice introductory course on ML. A few typos in the slides could/should be corrected. Test submission (though Octave) should definitely be improved.,4
57293,the class is very good. i just think the assignmengs are not enough.I feel I can't learn about itdeeper.,4
57337,Course is well taught and straightforward. Exercises are painfully easy.,4
57340,"This course is an amazing course. I have completed around 4 weeks of material. The concepts are covered both top-down and bottom-up. The instructor really adds value with every video.To improve this course, I would recommend covering more topics and make the assignments a bit harder. At least towards the end of each assignment.",4
57354,"Good course but a little light on the theory, especially on SVM's",4
57363,"Great Course although I would suggest taking a linear algebra course prior to enrolling this one. Coding the Matrix in Coursera, for example.",4
57377,"well explained, detailed",4
57412,"As far as I have learned, I would say that the way the course being taught is simple and understandable.",4
57417,"Very comprehensive and informative course on Machine learning. However, some of the lectures are a little dry and I fell asleep...",4
57422,Very good introduction and exercise in the fundamentals of modern machine learning.Would be better if an optional reading list of key articles/books in the field were provided.,4
57428,Amazing course.Only watched a few lectures so far but very interesting,4
57431,"some weeks are really easy and understandable, but some which consist of 2x number of lessons are far more challengable, moreover the topic during such weeks may be also way more harder. i would really consider somehow redistribute tasks/lessons to make all weeks of a similar level of understandability and possessing the same number of video lessons.overall it's a really great course though",4
57434,"Comprehensive course, well-designed assignments. Definitely a good start for learning ML.",4
57456,"A good introduction to machine learning. Andrew Ng has a more in-depth course on Stanford Engineering Everywhere, if anyone wants to learn more.",4
57466,A fantastic introductory course for Machine Learning.,4
57470,Very good machine learning class.But sometimes a little bit short on the mathematical proofs.,4
57488,The only reason that it does not get 5 star is due to the fact that the uploading of assignment is really confusing. The code is not uploaded till the solution is right which creates confusion whether the code is wrong or the upload mechanism is wrong,4
57502,"Great course, it gives a good picture of machine learning. It would be useful to apply all the course in one small example like ocr.",4
57527,"Good introduction to machine learning, from basic knowledge to a deeper insight in the subject.",4
57532,"This course had fantastic content, and very clear lecturing style, and minimal errors.At times I felt the lectures were a bit too long and repetitive, and found myself jumping through them quickly. I found that Andrew took minutes to say something that should only take 10 seconds; but I am aware that most students would appreciate this.The assignments were great, only with a few bits of information lacking and one assignment requiring me to dig around in the Discussion Boards for a solution (an error in the supplied code was causing me to fail the assignment).If I could give 4.5 stars I would, but I can't give the course 5 stars given the points above.Overall: Very enjoyable and insightful!",4
57533,"Even that I have studied Machine Learning before at college, you can get a little bit lost in the Maths, parameters and matrix sizes.Documentation with some theory and the equations would help a lot",4
57538,"Course provided very good general overview of ML, but did not go in-depth into mathematics behind many of algorithms discussed.",4
57542,"This course was a great introduction into the field of Machine Learning, covering multiple approaches and possible applications, all spread between a series of simple projects and easy-to-follow lecture videos.Many of the terms used were highly technical, and it could be difficult to keep them separate at times, but the way they were presented offered a chance for association with mathematics rather than just a word.Rated 4/5 for ability to break down complex topics and subject material. as well as the depth of the explanations, but with insufficient emphasis on application to reasonably transfer these concepts from academia to the real world.",4
57549,"A great, succinct course is for begin learner.",4
57553,"Let me say that this is a great course and that I enjoyed it very much!My only problem is with the assignment that are, in my opinion, a bit limited and most of the time they focus on liner algebra implementations rather than give a better understanding of the algorithm.Most of the time the assignments focus on implementing a formula where the algorithm itself is already written for us.That is good as a first step but in the long run it doesn't give you some practical skills when you want to apply the algorithm to an external dataset.I would suggest to add some challenges (maybe ungraded) keggle style, like provided this dataset try to get a score better than a value. This will spark some discussion and it would help to apply the concepts and the practical tricks to a real (chewed) problem.",4
57559,Very good theoretical explaination but more practical exercises would have been welcome,4
57578,The course really makes you understand how Machine Learning algorithms work. You have to solve challenging programming exercises to complete it. Fortunately the support given by the community is always one click away.Professor Andrew Ng is really an engaging person who transmit his deep love for the matter.I would save the fifth star for when typos will be solved and audio quality will be improved.,4
57592,"Great instructor, high",4
57594,"Very good, only the programming exercises are a little basic.",4
57601,"Good course, needs a little updating though.",4
57612,This course is very kind and easy to learn.,4
57636,"Very Good Course, Introduction of Concepts of ML with practical hand on training and TIps/advice to apply in practice",4
57649,"Good. However, I need more detail and advanced exercise.",4
57664,Less intellectually stimulating than I would have liked it to be but fairly comprehensive,4
57667,"Great professor, good material. If anything the class was too easy.",4
57676,Excellently put together.Little trouble with the Matlab licensing duration though.,4
57680,Extremely well designed course to introduce many practical aspects of machine learning.,4
57685,Exceptional content and absolutely amazing tutor.,4
57698,A very good introduction. Leaves one equipped enough to know the relevant areas to advance into ML,4
57701,"Loved the course, basic explained very well, assigments could be more challenging and built in python/R.",4
57715,"The lectures were good to excellent. The homework assignments were decent but felt a little ""dumbed down"". If it had been based on Python or R instead of MATLAB/Octave it would have been better though.There were lots of problems with submission using Octave. I almost quit because I just couldn't get it to work correctly, at least on a Mac. Switching to MATLAB made it easier. But MATLAB isn't something I'm going to be able to freely use after the course.Overall I found it to be a nice basic introduction to Machine Learning. It seems to have really just scratched the surface in terms of depth, but the breadth was good. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction or first course in machine learning.",4
57727,it will be better with some examples of code;,4
57754,"All in all a great introductory course.For a 3rd year physics student, the math could have been more challenging without putting too much of a strain on me.",4
57755,Pros:1. Good examples and way of discussion.2. Real experience in using of real applications.Cons:1. Usage of MATLAB ( why not R or Python?),4
57756,Very nice but too slow. I watched all of it at 2x wishing there was some way to speed it up even further.,4
57768,"It's very smooth learning process, it's also helpful to me.",4
57791,So far I have liked this course. Ng is awesome. I can now understand why this course is considered as one of the best courses to learn Machine learning. I will revisit my review once I complete the entire course. I hope I will add another star to my rating.,4
57806,A great introduction to the basics and key points of statistical machine learning.,4
57840,"Great videos and good course structure.I did feel the assignments were sometimes a bit too 'easy', a lot was pre-programmed and the to-be implemented formulas were often provided in the assignments. This made it quite time-efficient, but perhaps the understanding improves when working with lecture notes for people to refer to when recalling formulas from the lectures.",4
57865,Very informative.,4
57895,I missed something more about the last lessons. Some achievements like in the previous.,4
57904,"He is not a excellent teacher,but also a inspiring guider.",4
57910,"Well-paces, great teacher. However, the assignments are a bit too simple.",4
57923,"Thank you for that course, I really enjoyed it. Mr. Ng is a great speaker, his voice is very clear and as it was very easy to understand him, even as a not native english speaker.I learned a lot of (in my understanding) ""basics"" of machine learning. The class was in my opinion to basic and to easy. I would really love to get more information, I've studied electronic- and information science, so most of the things he explained were already basics for me, only the usage of them was new.One of the most important things (for the job I have at the moment) I learned here was how to code properly vectorized code in Matlab. I use Matlab nearly every day at work but never got such a good explanation how to use the full power of Matlab.Again, thank you for this great course, I can suggest this course to everyone who wants to learn the basics of machine learning. After that... Maybe someone has an idea how to continue in that topic to increase my understanding and knowledge of Machine learning.",4
57926,"loved it,really helpful for my project",4
57942,"There's some great material in here, though it doesn't have the maturity in terms of content development as many newer courses. A lot of the material is very accessible, but some is less so.",4
57951,Each concept nicely and neatly explained,4
57983,hope can have more coding exercises in last two seminar.,4
57997,Good course material for beginners in Data Science.,4
58008,Very good introduction to machine learning. The only issue I have is quality of video materials which is rather low mostly due to bad mic used.,4
58020,Excellent high level introductory course at a very affordable price! The material is very accessible and pragmatic for a basic programmer but still alludes to the very complex theory behind the algorithms. I highly suggest reading the pdf course notes if you want more of the theory.,4
58023,Great experience for my first mooc,4
58032,Enjoyment is beyond imagination...with machine learning,4
58036,"A very nice introductory course to quickly grasp main concepts and be prepared for further deeper studying of specific cases. Good balance between theory and practice. Lots rigorous mathematical stuff is given in supplementary materials, so those who love to bother have an opportunity to see the 'whole picture'.",4
58052,A great course where you really get to work with the interesting stuff!,4
58074,"The instructor Andrew NG is very good with his material and his explanation methods, but the course does not delve much into the details of the methods. My expectation of the course was that it would explain the core mathematics behind the scenes.",4
58077,"It is very nice course. I appreciate the way, basics of machine learning are taught and",4
58079,Excellent course. Well recommended. Assessment items need a minor update to account for changes.,4
58084,It's really good! the reason that is not 5 is that there are some sync errors with the exercises/lessons that confuse you.,4
58103,it was very interesting but more hands on will be better.,4
58105,Very good lecture. The assignments could be a bit more difficult/complex.,4
58113,"Really good course. Interesting topics, and good assignments.",4
58127,"Can't say I got a full understanding of what ML is all about, but at least I know what to search for should I need to use it now.The assignments seemed to be very hard in the beginning, but as soon as I got used to them they appeared to be too simple. All I had to do was to find correct order of matrices multiplication. I would like to be more involved in solving them.Nevertheless the course is quite interesting and, I hope, quite helpful.",4
58136,this course is very basic. does not explain the concepts in details. Course instructor is very nice.Looking forward for a course in depth of machine learning and related algorithms from Andrew ng.,4
58139,Good but sometimes pretty fast.,4
58150,It's a good start for those who want to start explore Data Science. If more(Optional) concepts were included It would really be nice for those who already know a bit of Machine Learning.,4
58152,Very well constructed course and good assignments that bring out the essence of machine learning.,4
58157,"Applications exercises are allocated within specific areas of larger scripts, which allows the student to complete small tasks that are still put into context of a general project.The lessons are well illustrated, and developing intuitions of the mathematical concepts is well facilitated",4
58164,"This is a great course. The only thing I would suggest is to add more explanations of some themes, and examples. Other than that, everything is great!Cheers,Dusan",4
58167,The teaching content is excellent. The instructor's explanation is clear and intuitive.It would be more helpful if the instructor can address the forums at times rather than leaving it entirely to the TAs.,4
58170,"Nice beginner level course. Shows the big picture without dwelling much into nitty-gritty. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra would not hurt but that's not necessary. Needless to say, Prof Andrew's teachings/advices were fabulous during the course. Programming assignments were mostly trivial. They can be made a bit challenging. Thanks.",4
58176,Because perfection does not exist and this is my first online courses so I can not really objectively judge.,4
58198,Great introduction to Machine Learning,4
58200,Really great theoretical introduction to various Machine Learning algorithms.,4
58228,"Great! This is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student. It provides a chance for us to study different type of machine learning algorithm. The assignment also gives you a chance to practice these algorithms on some application example. If this course can provide more deeply mathematics algorithm or guideline for future study on learning algorithm, it will be a perfect course!",4
58241,"Despite the (relative) complexity of studied algorithms, this course is really well explained.Pedagogically and progressively.Thank you.",4
58264,"The course is verg good,and from assignment I also gain a lot.But I still expect teachers can tell us more details.",4
58276,"This course is practical.The ""Machine Learning"" learners can get training how to implement a part of AI algorithms dealing programming exercises.Harrison",4
58280,"An exceptional course which opened my eyes to the world of machine learning. I'm able to see patterns already as to how and when to apply the algorithms learned given different scenarios. The instructor Andrew is very good, clear, cohesive and coherent. The discussion group contains almost every help needed and the mentors are good. The course is also paced extremely well. But I felt there could have been more. Maybe I would be asking for a lot, but can there be more to this? I would certainly love to go a little deeper than this in the world of machine learning.",4
58281,"The first course ever on the Coursera platform, it is a very clear and comprehensive introduction to machine learning, with awesome explanations by professor Andrew Ng and fun and useful quizzes and programming excercises that help assimilate and understand the material. I would give 5 stars if a final exam and final bigger programming project was included, to really help students master the concepts and apply them to tougher problems. But overall it is a really great course! Highly recommended!",4
58288,"the first part is amazing. very well, but when I begin with Mat lab, I´m in the way but alone two steps after. Is dificult for beginers.... in count is great experience find the solution and look the 100/100.It would be good: any more help in the first steps in Mat lab.",4
58304,"Thanks a lot Andrew NG for one of the best and most descriptive online courses I took so far. Just as a small point open to improvement, in MATLAP/Octave assignments, students may be encouraged more to apply the core steps of the algorithms on their own.",4
58306,Very good and complete course with a quite high level of examination.,4
58310,This course is good but not the best I've seen,4
58351,Neural networks lectures need to be more decipherable.,4
58353,The course gives a nice overview of ML. I only wish it was in python.,4
58354,"Amazing course, everything is explained in a great depth, assaiments are thoughtful and engaging, I recommend it to everyone who is interested in Machine Learning, or passionate about that AI dream.Thank you.Israel Gilyadov.",4
58355,This was best course till I took Machine Learning from University of Washington,4
58358,All topics are introduced well. The pace of the lectures could be faster.The programming assignments are a really good addition and help to understand how the techniques work!,4
58372,Sound quality could be improved in video. It kind of curbs the understanding of what the teacher is saying :/ Otherwise everything's great!,4
58381,"Great mix of low level technical details, exposure to a variety of topics, and high level strategies.",4
58384,"I'll only mentions things I didn't like: sound/video quality is poor, lack of lecture notes.",4
58395,Excellent but very time consuming,4
58401,"Awesome class. It was very accessible and had some great examples. I would have liked to see a little more asked of the students. It would have been fun to implement some more examples that required the full ML tool box (cross validation, training). I was a little surprised that there were no discussion / examples of tree classifiers or Naive Bayes. It would have been helpful to have a discussion on how to handle categorical features.",4
58407,Awesome course and explnations,4
58418,a bit harder to catch up with the deadlines...,4
58422,Don't be deterred by the use of octave. It's turned out to be a very quick way to get into the algebra of the models. A good course to point you towards the mathematical foundations: if you want more depth the detail is provided.,4
58425,"This is a great introduction in Machine learning. It covers many aspect with a very logical progression in difficulty and easy to follow (require some algebra knowledge, but there is some introduction in the course).",4
58459,"I am really satisfied with the course. I'm really glad I stuck with it. Looking forward to putting it to practice.The way the course is organized is really good. It's amazing to look back in all the subjects studied and how each one is built on top of each other. It is also good how there is always a programming exercise that really makes you think about the content studied on that lesson.I think the videos really need some post production. Some videos could be shortened since there is repeated material: Andrew decides to restart the explanation, because he messed up or something, but the part the he messed up is still in the video.It would be good if the Wiki that is present in Week 1 could also be present in all other Weeks, so we as students could feel encouraged to write the Wiki of each Week.",4
58461,Great Course and Great Teacher!.Most of the topics covered are described in clear and practical way and the programming exercides help to get a better understanding.Perfecto to have an initial but solid backgroung abour Machine Learning.,4
58475,It is great and the instructor is excellent.,4
58501,Great for introduction to this area.It let us think we understood wide area of machine learning but in fact it's not so simple and not comprehensive.,4
58504,I am just loving it! Thank you for all your effort.,4
58515,I have really benefited immensely from this course. Andrew handled the course very well. I thank the entire team.,4
58554,This course is quite basic in that it offers intuition and insights of ml methods in a less math-heavy fashion. It would be nice if more material/additional optional reading is offered for someone interested in the proof of some key points.,4
58556,"The course provides an excellent overview of the Machine learning . However, the programming assignments are quite basic once OCTAVE/MATLAB is well understood. The quizzes are interesting. Could include a capstone project with guidance.",4
58565,"I really enjoyed the course. It was a very good introduction to a lot of topics in machine learning. The quizes and assignments were manageable but not too easy.However, there were no written course materials to print out. Thats the reason I only rate the course 4 stars.",4
58604,Well explanation and very informative notes for better understanding the real problems.,4
58641,This course is informative. It is structured & executed smoothly.,4
58655,"Very good course, but too focused on quantitatively analysis, maybe the practical applications will come in subsequent weeks.",4
58669,"Overall, an excellent course. Well organized and taught. MatLab/Octave homeworks can be tedious but thats coding for you.",4
58693,"Octave was the pain point.concept theory well explained, python/R would have added a lot of value to this.",4
58700,I really like this course. Very useful and I can learn Matlab also.,4
58735,"This is an excellent introduction to ML. Coming from a mathematical background, I felt that at times the course was a bit slow (e.g. Professor Ng would spend time performing steps on every element of a matrix, when a couple of examples would have sufficed), but jumping ahead in the video solved this problem easily. I was a bit more frustrated, however, with the few instances of, ""here's the formula, you don't need to know the derivation."" I guess those who want to understand the math behind the techniques can always look elsewhere, but Professor Ng obviously knows a great deal and is able to clearly and concisely explain difficult subjects, and so I was a bit disappointed to not be getting his instruction in the more difficult aspects.But, overall this course is great. In particular, I found the programming assignments to be excellent. They are a good level of difficulty, and manage to be quite interesting, as well. I will definitely hold onto the code I wrote for this course for reference as I move forward.Professor Ng, please create a more advanced course next!",4
58736,Good introduction course to machine learning.There is no capstone project which is a disappointment,4
58739,exhaustive explanation with proper detailing of the concept.,4
58745,"I miss some practical examples and applications. It is great, but too much theory.",4
58753,"An excellent overview of a hot and powerful field. Interesting and relevant examples. Some typos remain, but most are minor and easily discovered.",4
58754,"Sometimes the course may feel too basic, but it makes everything very clear. Closed lots of gaps in my knowledge about machine learning. The only regret I feel that the course does not cover decision trees and bayesian networks.",4
58770,"It is not perfect, but as an open course it is impressive.",4
58775,The best online course i've ever attended. The explainations are crystal clear even for non-methematicians and the topic is widely covered ( No deep learning nor bayesian methods though). If only my former college teachers would've been half that good..,4
58778,"very good, but i think more suggested materials are needed.",4
58796,Bit too fast.,4
58806,Just awesome!,4
58812,"The course was well organized and structured.It was a bit complicated to get the submission process starting, due to the patches necessary.It is a very nice course to demystify machine learning algorithms.",4
58828,"great way to organize the information of the course, clear steps, logically structured.",4
58835,Great teacher! I wonder if this course could be done in python.,4
58845,The course content was excellent. Only drawback was voice recording quality.,4
58850,Really interesting so far. Learning a lot of cool things. Might be time for some updates as some of the course material seems really old.,4
58851,Great course but light on the mathematical part would love to get those insights.,4
58855,I enjoyed the course. It covered many machine learning topics and supplied good advice and simple working example. It is a great practical guide.,4
58857,assignment might be bit more hard and complex.,4
58860,"one of the best online course out there for any beginner to learn machine learning. Even if your background of maths is not strong, don't let that stop you from joining this course. The instructor is very good in explaining basic mathematics. In short, advance calculus is not a requirement for this course (but good to have).",4
58870,Presented in a very easy way!,4
58902,"Prof Andrew Ng did an extremely amazing job, he took the effort to not leave out even many obvious details. He ensured everyone was following the course, and the course itself has covered many aspects of supervised learning etc. It works as a great introductory course for someone who is new to the paradigm and would be the first step if someone is interested in pursuing research interests in the field",4
58923,I felt like the Octave tutorial was a little light.The concepts were explained well through the videos. Intuition was given which is always useful. I think an improvement would be more examples in the videos or as example sets for the sections to help. Jumping straight into the assignments without applying the lessons first in a mistake-allowable environment is a bit daunting and can feel overwhelming.,4
58938,Very interesting for beginners. But I wish more math in this course.,4
58942,Good course for beginners in Machine Learning. Programming exercises can be a little more complex,4
58943,"This is the first course I am taking on Coursera, it is very good, and I would like to see more more courses.",4
58962,Very good course.,4
58968,The programming exercises were too structured and the course was quite easy.,4
58975,Got good grip over the basics of Machine Learning. Prof. Andrew NG teaches the concepts very clearly and makes the flow of the course very lucid and optimal,4
58985,This is a great course. My only concern is that it goes slow at times and it feels like topics are being discussed repeatedly. I would rather have the wiki lecture notes prominently displayed for my reference rather than having to watch very nuanced lecture videos because I sit through a lot of uneccessary video out of concern that I will miss something important.,4
58997,Very engaging and easy to follow course with a lot of good samples as part of assignment. Loving it so far.,4
59006,"Great course !Just had to re-pass all my assignments when the certificate became available, because the first time I passed them my identity was not verified.Also, it would be nice to have some kind of ""download all the course's content"" link at the end of the course, to be able to save the material for later reference.Thank you for this fantastic course !",4
59009,"Very well structured course. Professor is excellent. Lecture videos are easy to understand, have good examples, and are well organized. The assignments are relevant and illustrate the process of actually running machine learning.However, the scope of topics does feel a bit too ""intro/basic"" and the material and assignments feel spoonfed. It would have been great if the course went deeper into each topic and also challenged the student to do more coding independently in Octave/Matlab.",4
59044,"An excellent introduction to machine learning, it gives much confidence with hands-on learning. The pace of the course is very good with required information being given to student with minimal confusion by a good teacher. After this course a typical student would be well prepared to learn further for solving real life problems.",4
59045,Really cool class! Well put together with very manageable exercises. Would have liked to get more insight into actual machine learning systems out there.,4
59053,"Very good course with a lot of hands-on, direct-to-application assignments. It is fairly introductory, so all you need is first year calculus, which in itself is not bad but this course is fairly theory-light. The theory that is included is just enough to be able to refer to further theory not covered.",4
59055,easy to understand the course material,4
59064,An awesome course which can take you from an absolute beginner level to an expert level!,4
59076,"Lots of great condensed content. I miss a written summary of the videos though. Furthermore, the quality of sound is awful. Well designed quizzes and assignments. Good: In-video quizzes.",4
59095,The course is good to begin with,4
59108,A good class. I kept 1 star for the future in case I am having had a better class.,4
59143,Very good course!,4
59162,I have a strong background in programming and math so it was relatively basic but a good survey of the field of ML.,4
59166,"One of the best, and detailed Machine Learning MooCs out there. The only reason I rated it 4 is because, I would have preferred to learn these algorithms using R, Python or Julia.",4
59171,"Good introduction to machine learning although the later exercises were quite easy. Once you get through the neural net back propagation section, there really isn't much of a challenge left. That said, you do get a good sense of how the various algorithms are implemented and can self-study from there.",4
59196,I wish programming assignments were a little more in-depth. Otherwise a great course. Exceeded my expectations.,4
59197,"Great professor and teaching style, the quiz helps to understand the fundamental concepts, and coding projects also provide hands-on experience and knowledge to gain deeper learning of this subject.",4
59199,Really useful and fantastic course. But the tutor's words are so fast and the course's content is a little hard to understand. Maybe give us more time will be better.,4
59217,"The programming exercises aren't really all that challenging...just implement the formulas provided in the course or in the assignment itself, and you're mostly done.I hate the questions on the quizzes that are ""Select all the following that are true..."" The only questions I ever got wrong on quizzes were of that sort.",4
59233,I love Andrew Ng's clear speeking and the ability to make complex knowledge simpler.,4
59238,"Hello, the course is great. Only one suggestion is to go a little bit deeper in subjects such as SVM optimization techniques or PCA mathematical background. At least a good set of references could be suggested for the interested s",4
59239,"Solid course materials, interesting examples and cases, sometimes really difficult, learned a lot!",4
59252,Octave is so ridicules! It is better to be more practical and have a connection to real world applications.,4
59257,I missed some videos showing how to do the matrix manipulations we need for the ML algorithms using matlab/octave...not talking about a generic introduction to it but something specific to what we are trying to implement in the assignments...,4
59265,Really great teacher. Examples and Tutorials are great too. Some typos and missing explanations but thats part of every learning process :-),4
59275,Andrew Ng walks you through some complex material in a way that makes it easy to grasp the basic notions. The assignments are very well documented and the code skeleton that's provided makes it easy to complete them (maybe a bit too easy - someone would have a rough awaking when having to code all this from scratch again as they apply it to their real jobs).,4
59302,This Cause is easy to understanding and practical.,4
59307,"A good introduction to the subject. Holds your hand through the programming exercises, which is good for people with little background in programming.",4
59309,"The video lectures are informative. As a student, I am also expecting to see its applications in various fields with sample codes if possible to practice the theory.",4
59312,"intuitive, practical, impressive and refined introduction to machine learning.",4
59336,"This is a survey course in Machine Learning which isn't afraid to get seriously in-depth with the detailed math and coding techniques underlying popular ML topics like logistic regression, neural networks, and SVMs. Andrew Ng also spends considerable time on applications and methods for determining if your learner is robust. It is a very challenging course, both conceptually and with the assignments. The assignments are very difficult and will require considerable time and effort. Previous experience with Matlab/Octave is helpful. In terms of math, I think at least one course in Linear Algebra should be prerequisite as the use of vector and matrix operations abound in this class. A good understanding of the programming concept of vectorization is also very helpful...if you don't already understand it...you will after you get through this course. A special thanks to Tom Mosher, one of the class mentors....his help and advice was very helpful in completing the course.",4
59354,I´d really like to rate this a 5/5 but there is always room for improvement.,4
59360,"+: Great deal of useful knowledge conveyed, explanations step by step, quizzes during videos, assignments challenging but doable, awesome assignment submission tool via Octave (makes fun seeing it work :) )-: Videoquality",4
59363,It is nice course to learning ML,4
59377,Pretty cool!,4
59388,It is very interesting but the data collection and preparations in every example is not clear. please work on it.,4
59390,"Great overview of Machine Learning. I've learnt a lot, so why not 5 stars? I put more time than advertised especially in solving practical assignments with Octave, but it's certainly because of my lack of math background.",4
59416,"I really enjoyed the class, and I feel like I learned a lot! I'd have given it 5 stars, but there's there are parts of the homework asignments that aren't well organized, for example I didn't know about the unit tests in the discussion threads for a while, and there's more detailed descriptions of the programming sections but they're really hard to find. All in all, a really good experience though.",4
59445,"Great introduction to Machine Learning! It was really simple to follow. For the practical exercises however, I struggled a bit with the programming language itself rather than with the actual algorithm implementation. It would be also good to have a list of recommended readings.",4
59451,Excellent course. My only criticism was that there was perhaps a little too much hand-holding in the assignments. Still learned a ton! Thank you!,4
59457,Great overview and intro to ML! Look forward to more advanced course,4
59465,Part of Neural net could be better explained,4
59472,"There should be more multiple choice questions; 20+ instead of just 5 questions.There should be more MCQ tests. 5+ instead of just one.There should be more assignments. 3+ instead of just one. Make it one easy, one medium and one hard.There should be more optional assignments. 5+ instead of just one.I know you guys are working hard as it is, but we learn by doing, not by listening or watching. Just food of thought.",4
59474,"The course is very good and Prof NG's explanation is also perfect.There could have been some ungraded examples to practice different type of scenarios, to help us understand more.",4
59496,Videos still need editing a bit,4
59516,"Great course! A little on the easy side for people who have seen ML before, but definitely offering many great insights and tools with which one can improve upon their models.",4
59517,Indepth technical introduction to machine learning and its related concepts.,4
59520,"Very good introductory course to Machine learning, though later parts of the course seemed to be rushed-through a little. Practical exercises were really great.",4
59534,The topics covered are really good. It could have been better if a few of the topics are covered in depth.,4
59552,"good material but sound quality of videos is bad, could use his own machine learning techniques to improve the sound, also no literature which is bad.",4
59557,"This is an excellent course. I'm only part way through, but I feel like I am learning a lot. It is covering the material that it promised in the outline. The pacing is right on. And I've found the quizzes and assignments have really helped me understand the material better.I only have a few minor quibbles.For one, the audio, especially in the early lectures, is rather muffled. This might make the lectures difficult to view in a noisy environment (eg. in a crowded subway car), but it is fine --though a bit of a nuisance-- in a quiet one.Another problem I've noticed is that some of the assignments are ordered in the course listing ahead of the lectures that cover the material (eg. regularization). At worst, this is a nuisance and is easy to work around -- just proceed with the lectures.Overall, I'm very glad to be taking the course and am very satisfied with it so far.",4
59560,Well structured course although I do hate the octave and matlab limitation as the only programming language for this course.,4
59563,"Very interesting, easy to follow videos (right level of detail on linear algebra) and lots of algorithms, techniques and tips!For the last lessons, however, the practice is a bit ""black box"" where you have everthing initialized and you just plug in your functions, I'd liked more details on how everything was set.",4
59583,Video lessons are excellent. Homework is well-written and does a good job of illustrating the lessons.,4
59604,"Machine Learning is a complete course about the mathematical techniques to make computers learn by themselves. In this course you will study the rationale behind mathematical algorithms and learn how to translate it into computation languages such as Octave or MAtlab. Warning: the course is fast-paced and requires some intermediate level on calculus, programming and algebra. You will be able to pass the course even if you are not pro at that but it will be hard!",4
59607,Very Good!!!!,4
59612,"Very interesting content, very well explained.Minor issues: some quizzes or questions appear a little early sometimes regarding the order of the videos though, and subtitles are not always correct.",4
59616,Quite informative and the Tutor is good,4
59622,"While the professor doesn't want to confuse the audience with proofs and calculus, I think it would be nice to have some extra videos that explain in detail the proofs and reasoning behind the different formulas used throughout the course.",4
59624,Excellent course and pretty good job done by Andrew Ng who not only mentions different techniques used in machine learning but also explains the intuition behind them in layman terms.,4
59625,"This course was well organized, although it was (for me) often a bit lacking in deep mathematical detail.",4
59633,"Wonderful course! Sound quality requires revision, but content is supreme.",4
59648,"I would give 4.5 stars but not full marks because I don't believe there is sufficient support for novice programmers. More worked examples earlier on with MatLab would have been invaluable and the first week could have an easy programming project to establish the basics via practical experience rather than lecture.However, I found the material to be otherwise fascinating and inspiring in the potential power of Machine Learning to apply mathematical principles to ameliorate the human condition. This has confirmed the path I have chosen. Thank you.",4
59650,"Very nice, the only bad thing is that the instructor uses Octave/Matlab, It would have been nice if he have used Python instead.",4
59678,"It is very suitable for those who have no background involving machine learning, this lecture is very basic but practical and essential.",4
59685,Great course,4
59692,"Excellent course, could be helped by having some prerequisites and then dispensing with the parts that breeze very secularly through weighty topics such as Linear Algebra and general interpreter based programming.<3",4
59696,Can have a more math background for those who are interested,4
59700,"Awesome, thx Mr.Andrew, the course is very clear and intuitive .",4
59734,A little bit advaced algebra and calculus for most of the users,4
59743,Excellent course talking about the fundamentals of machine learning. Definitely worth the time and effort. I would have given it a 5 if it had any information on how to handle non numerical data like categorical or text features.,4
59747,Very good overview of ML for beginners.Each technique is very detailed and presented from intuition to pratice,4
59757,Truly amazing !!Learned a lot in this course.,4
59759,i love machine learning. the course structure is awesome,4
59769,"Lots of great information, a good introduction to machine learning algorithms. I feel confident I can apply what I've learned to real problems and systems. Main complaint is I wish there were more programming exercises on applying ML algorithms to real problems and less on implementing the algorithms that in reality I'm probably going to just use from a library like scikit-learn.",4
59781,"The topic is interesting, the course content is presented clearly, and the lectures are informative. While the assignments can be challenging, they really help to reenforce the lessons.From what I gather, the class was recently moved over from an older Coursera model/design. This is frustratingly apparent at times. Some information can be difficult to find, particularly in the Discussion section. I would love to see this class updated to match the quality of some more recent classes I have taken.",4
59784,"It was amazingly done, but sadly it is not up to date any more.",4
59815,I am sad to see after accomplishing 11 weeks course there wasn't any certificate given.,4
59835,"Great instructor, great class, the only reason I don't give 4 stars is that the homework is a bit buggy shall we say. But overall this is a fantastic class, well worth the effort.",4
59873,this is a great course to begin your way in machine learning.,4
59874,Very well taught course.Could have been better if would have been taught using R or Python,4
59878,"Excellent course !Good choice of topics, great explanations, I liked that there are many practical tips.I would have liked: less guided programming exercises (the solution was almost given in the comments in the file to write) and larger (the student has to write only small bits of the overall project).I would also have liked recommended links or reading whenever a proof or an explanation of a mathematical result was skipped. I think the choice of what was skipped as too detailed for an intro was good, but would have been nice to have pointers for students who wanted to explore more.",4
59925,I think this is an overview course about machine learning.,4
59930,Fun course to take. Sometimes a little bit overexplaining obvious things (due to this it's often convenient to watch videos with 1.5x-2.0x speeds) and hiding quite a great amount of math. Even though it doesn't fulfill all my requirements and demands (that is explaining the nature of method/algorithm and it's derivation) I definitely can understand teacher's focusing on the practical side of the subject.,4
59942,"Overall this is a really great course.My small criticism: Sometimes I wished for more optional videos containing proofs of the formulas. I often spent all the time watching the videos wondering how we would solve some problem only to be presented with a formula without any explanation where it came from. This is only a small problem because the answer was usually not too hard to find and often even linked in the discussion, but if this information were contained in the course content (e.g. optional videos assuming some linear algebra background), it would be even better.",4
59944,This course is very easy to understand. Because of this it's oversimplified,4
59950,Bit technical. Totally worth it.,4
59982,"nice fundamental machine learning course, only drawback is ""octave"" as a learning platform",4
60016,"This course is excellent and covers many topics, I recommend it.We are never lost during the videos because the motivations are well explained.Furthermore Andrew Ng speaks very clearly and is easily understood by a non native English speaker like me.I liked particularly the practical advices with the common mistakes that we should avoid.I don't give 5 stars just because it lacks a follow-up in order to go deeply to the subject, with a kind of final project and a certificate given in case of success.Maybe I should also have a look at the corresponding Stanford course which is supposed to be more complete than the online one.",4
60032,"Would be nice to have lessons handsout if we do not want to watch the videos, the exercices are very well done so far. Very good course",4
60037,A bit too mathematical for an overview course,4
60040,Allow students to code in python or other programming languages also.,4
60045,"I give this course 4 stars as I did learn a lot from it, and thought most of it is well prepared and useful.I found some disappointment in some of the programming assignments where I wanted to understand the code better but it was not documented properly. In such cases the common response was that the material goes beyond the scope of the course.I thank Andrew Ng for the material and hope this gets resolved in the future.",4
60074,this course has started new era in field of machine learning... Thanks to Andrew,4
60089,"Thank you to Andrew Ng for a great ML introductory course for a person with programming background. It gives a very good start for anyone who is clue-less about what ""machine learning"", ""data scientist"", ""neural networks"" etc. really mean. Assignments are designed just right - so that a newbie is not overwhelmed, gets confidence as s/he progresses.As I mentioned I consider it introductory course, because it gives lot of information which you tend to forget as you move through this course. So you need to practice a lot with real life example before you can become an expert.Now the challenge is finding a problem that has not been tackled using ML and trying to tackle it with what I have learned.",4
60109,Very informative and very well done. The instructor does a great job breaking things down.I'd like to suggest better step by step explanation of the formulas and each index and each term clearly; as well as running a simple example and tracing the intermediate variables after each approach is presented. Sometimes the formulas and indices are a little too confusing.Thanks for providing this amazing course.,4
60113,Highly recommended for beginners in Machine Learning...,4
60115,nice course for beginners,4
60148,Great course for understand the basics and some of the tricks,4
60184,"A great course! Challenging, relevant, and every concept used is clearly explained.",4
60186,Great course. Would have liked to have a final project and some more in-depth videos for the mathematics of some of the algorithms. Slides/notes for each lecture or unit or week would be extremely helpful for those who take the class in the future or for those who have finished and would like to review the material. The programming assignments were very interesting and close to the real world. Enjoyed the course overall.,4
60194,I am really enjoying this course. It's a fun mix of my programming skills and math interests. I Strongly recommend taking Sal Kahn's course on Linear Algebra (@ Khanacademy) or having some Linear Algebra background before taking this course.,4
60197,Good course but task is little bit lightweight,4
60201,It is one of the best basic introduction to the Machine Learning course.,4
60212,A good introductory course for newcomer in Machine Learning.,4
60233,The course content is thorough and meticulous. One of the best course I've pursued.,4
60236,It structured very well.,4
60241,Course is very good.I liked it. But what I didn't liked about it that you are not providing statement of accomplishment. If it would have been there I would have liked it more. It give boost to complete the course with full hard work. I hope you will give it a thought about it in future sessions.I know that this course is always open that can be a reason for you not providing statement of accomplishment but you are already grading students so it won't be that difficult to give statement of accomplishments,4
60245,The course contains some fundamental concepts of machine learning. It is not very hard to accomplish the course.,4
60284,"Its very helpful and informative course but some material need more material and clarificationsuch as : SVM ,recommendation system, large scale machinethank you very much",4
60291,It can be more interactive if small exercises are followed by each video as in edx.,4
60312,"The Good: This course is a good introduction to fundamental topics and basic techniques in machine learning. I feel that the biggest strength of this course comes from Prof. Ng's suggestions for how to design and improve machine learning systems in practice.The Bad: This course is a few years old, and there are a lot of errors in the videos and even occasionally in the programming exercises as well. In my opinion, there is a little too much hand-holding in the programming exercises, so that while I was able to implement the important bits and pieces of the algorithms, I didn't get much chance to practice the more difficult task of organizing the entire system.The Ambiguous: This course is *very* light on the math, perhaps as light as you could possibly get. I imagine this is a relief for a lot of people, but personally I felt annoyed and even a little patronized with the number of times Prof. Ng said that we ""don't have to worry"" about the mathematical details of different concepts and algorithms. It's fine to skip over derivations and details for the sake of a simple presentation or to emphasize practical application, but surely it is important to go back and see what all this stuff means eventually. I will certainly be looking for other courses on machine learning that give a more mathematical treatment, and I think that anyone who wants to seriously get into ML should probably do the same. On a related note, Prof. Ng takes his time in each video, speaking slowly, repeating different points, and carefully explicating formulas with examples. For some people that may be good, but I found myself frequently skipping ahead in videos because I just wanted to get to the point.",4
60354,"sometimes Chinese subtitle goes wrong, but generally it's a perfect net course.",4
60363,"Excellent course. In the start of this course, I never thought I'd be able to do things I can do, after completing the course. But the only thing that kept me from giving this course a straight five stars is the lack of formal proofs. E.g back-propagation algorithm or PCA. I know this is somewhat advanced Calculus/Linear Algebra topics but it would have been a lot helpful if an optional material was at-least given.",4
60370,Excellent course. It is applicable in many areas as our modern world is adding up complexity about everywhere and everyday in our lives. The course provides excellent perspectives of thinking and good exercisedecision,4
60376,This is very good capstone project,4
60378,Interesting course which goes one level dee,4
60394,The instructions for assignment are not clear.,4
60395,Great course on leadership and team management,4
60396,"This is a great course, I learnt a lot, and I must say I had to put in a lot of work for this course, and it had extra things to consider, like create SMART goals with action and resource plan, and using the prioritisation matrix, and ranking. Thanks for a great course",4
60398,Very Good.Faculty's speed of presentation is too fast,4
60401,"Some of the videos were a bit fast (too much content), but a very interesting course.",4
60406,"Great course, thanks Roger",4
60407,clear an,4
60409,"It was very informative. The instructor needs to slow down just a little though, I could tell he's a little nervous speaking to ""large groups"". Otherwise, it was great. I'm from BAWA and I am familiar with and love JHU, so I support any great course coming from there.",4
60413,Data Analysis and the technicalities of getting to the right results and presenting them in a meaningful way,4
60415,EDA approach and steps to analyse is excellently taught. The formal modelling take the course to a lot of depth.,4
60420,Need more examples and real world scenarios,4
60422,Useful overview for managers with helpful tips.,4
60426,good insights and foundation for a manager,4

60441,Good overview of the steps and processes,4
60443,well-defined process overview,4
60444,good course to understand keys questions and methodology to manage each step of data analysis process,4
60450,Very good... very important...Maybe too fast for a single week...,4
60452,Good learning of data analysis principles.,4
60454,Comprehensive overview to understand activities involved in the iterations and epicycles of Data Analysis and to manage it with correct expectation.,4
60458,I would have preferred that the course and/or accompanying textbook contain examples of templates used to manage data analysis.,4
60474,Liked how a lot of content was covered in a small amount of time. Thought the instructor was effective in presenting the important elements of the lectures. Only issue is some typos in the quizzes that were a bit distracting.,4
60475,"Excellent focus on what makes managing Data Analysis teams different from managing managing other teams. This course has the most impact if combined with general management background/classes. Speech fillers, like ""um,"" ""ah,"" ""like,"" etc. prove distracting at times.",4
60476,The content is covered in great depth in this course but pre-reads may help as the course moves up a few notches in technical content.,4
60479,Very good and quick lessons on Data analysis.Managers should appreciate this course!,4
60483,Nice course on what the most important,4
60486,Interesting course,4

60503,"Critical thinking is essential at the moment of working over data. This was a nice course with a very good theory about all the process,which a data analyst has to perform.",4
60510,Good course for the fundamentals of making sure data analysis is done correctly. These are good things to keep in mind when you are managing a data science team.,4
60512,"It was a great experience a big amount of knowledge in a short presentation. Overall the summary papers are great, however I missed a more interactive videos with more bullets points and etc.Thank you!",4
60515,This has some good history in it. But short for sure.,4
60518,"Excellent course, most especially for the professor, whose lucid, well-cadenced lectures were more interesting and comprehensible than I would have thought before starting the class, given the subject. Reading Kierkegaard is not easy, and having a professor who presents the topic with such clarity is a gift.",4
60519,This is an excellent course. The production values are very high and Dr. Stewart is a very good lecturer. I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in the history of thought and/or the intersection of theology and philosophy.,4
60528,"I found the course quite interesting overall and it is delivered by an excellent professor. It's a perfect introduction to Soren Kierkegaard's ideas and life. On the (slightly) negative side, sometimes I felt there was too much emphasis on the biographical details with a very light discussion of the philosophical concepts. However, I don't want to misled anyone with this: the course is very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Kierkegaard's philosophy.",4
60536,Prof. Stewart is amazing! He is able to take very complex concepts and make them understandable to a neophyte like me. Thank you very much.,4
60543,I love the lectures! Challenging and rigorous.,4
60546,"This course is interesting, though the main theme--i.e., how Socrates was a model for much of Kierkegaard's views--gets to be a bit redundant. Also, I did not find the final assignment to be as stimulating/interesting as the course material.",4
60549,I do not intend to write the final essay. I took the course for personal interest and accomplsihed my goals.,4
60565,"I loved the manner in which the course contents were delivered. The course teacher know the art of articulation. He knows how to teach complex ideas in a simple manner without loosing its essence of the argument. I was so immersed in his lecture, one full night I watched his lecture and finished 80% course material. I wish I could deliver a lecture like it. A big salute to an inspiring teacher.",4
60568,"Enjoyable, very interesting and easy enough to follow. I love how broad yet simultaneously specific the scope of learning is in this course too.",4
60570,"Very well presented course, but in my view could be somewhat more to the point. Nevertheless, congratulations for a job well done.",4
60587,"I have liked the course so far, I only have a sugestion on the quality of the videos:The first ones had a lot of background noise and the teacher explains a little too fast... maybe for students with a not very fluent level of Spanish it might be difficult to follow...I like the structure, it integrates activities, videos and quizzes so it is easy going.",4
60588,"I have been around horses for years but I still learned lots of new stuff with this course. The only negative point would be that, sometimes, the lectures lack of explanations. It is the case for week 5 when talking about deworming. I could have done with a few more details about the types of dewormers and how often I should administrate them. Apart from that, the course is great and very interesting.",4
60592,"This course covers anything you could possibly want to know about horses or other equids. It's great for beginners, like me. Having never owned any pets, much less a horse, I felt naïve in my knowledge on the correct handling of these wonderful creatures. This course really improved confidence for when I come into contact with horses. The only downside to this course was that it only gave one view as to how horses came in existence. There are some people, like me, who believe that all equids were specially created by the Creator. Perhaps for when the makers do this course again, they could give both views and let the viewers believe what they want. But everything else was great.",4
60601,It's an excellent basic course for anyone keen on equines. The best thing about it was interaction in assignments and peer marking.,4
60640,"please try and make easier but not too easy to pass. meaning less assignments and more quizzes, which i find fun to do.",4
60656,"Strong, fluid, insightfull and passionate course!",4

60916,It was good and simple,4
60926,"I liked this course. There are a lot of useful information. It's well-structured and includes a lot of examples. A moment I didn't like is locked assignments. In my opinion, it's ok when you can't get a certificate without payment but I can't see a reason for practice lock.",4

60960,Excelllent course. I have completed my first week modules,4
60965,"the course is very good, but in comparison with the first course with dr Leigh Thompson, the instructor in a little bit monotonus, and the screenplay does not have any illustrations which is needed badly. otherwise the course is very good and informative and a big thanks to the instructor and his respected assistants",4
60972,Interesting course. Thou the entire assignment is bundled up at the end.,4
60973,"I love the course, I thing it is important to know how yours stores impact other to do something.",4
60975,The content is laid out very well and I found a ton of useful take-away points. Thank you to all the faculty members. I particularly enjoyed the assignments - they really make you think. But I found the branding you - audit and insights the best exercise in this program.I would definitely recommend this to friends and colleagues.,4
60976,This course was very helpful to me..,4
60980,"The course content was very good. However, I would have liked to see assignments for each",4

61015,Its a short and nice course that gives you a basic insight of how basic management technique and budgeting can help you a lot in managing financial risks and also gives you some practical knowledge of some popular financial instruments .,4
61018,I personally think online courses are difficult since there is self-discipline involved but I like how organized the course is!,4
61024,Quick course to get started on the business industry,4

61031,Very useful course. A lot of useful,4
61042,It's definitely a course for undergrads. Very basic but would be valuable to someone without much life experience.,4
61044,Comprehensive. But some terms are aligned to the US and European economy. But I still had a good time learning about the basics.,4
61046,This course gives you a quick overview of the business major and if you find the video's pace too slow for you speed it up to 1.25 or 1.5 the speed and that will solve your problems.,4
61048,"nice , but basic",4
61051,"Thanks very much for the course! I really liked the optional exercise because they guide me to what to do on real life about what to do, and how to do it. Really loved your teachings. The only thing I would like to say I didn't like was the images behind you, I really enjoy people on real life background, maybe you should just seat at the coffee shop of your university or at an open area. Those photos are good, but I just think the scenario of the university or any other real would be more eye catching.",4
61056,I love this course very useful.Thanks guys for all the lectures.,4
61057,very helpful,4
61058,Great knowledge to share!,4
61059,"The information is really useful and for the most part, decently organised, but MY GOD Alex LeBron is so painfully boring. I couldn't even tell you what his voice sounds like because it's so bland and monotonous that it blends into the noise of the fan of my laptop.",4
61067,Cool course for beginners like me!,4
61069,"Good preliminary overview of these aspects of life, career and business.",4
61071,It explains all the basics and is not intended to make you an expert. 9/10 because the final lesson is trying to sell you an MBA degree rather than teaching you about personal finance,4
61076,"This course has been structured in such a way that any individual would able to understand the contents without the prior requirement of learning the jargon. All presentations are nicely done, good and simple explanation. Examples were given in each lecture in order to enhance our understanding.",4
61084,good course,4
61086,"Brief but great course! Offers the basic fundamentals for Personal Finance, Taxes, Insurance, and finishes up with the structure of the MBA program. While this is definitely a 100 level introduction, it is presented and laid out well. Going a little deeper into the subject matter would have earned this course a full 5-stars.",4
61090,"The instructors really had a simple structure throughout, which made the course itself interesting and easy to follow along. Also, the few wisecracks here and there are appreciated :)",4
61092,It's a great course with useful information. Would be even better if it was a little bit longer and more informative. Anyway it definitely give some foundations about personal finances. Thank you.,4
61096,Good introductory course,4
61098,"Very good basic overview of all the topics which we should be learning in School! Managing finances, evaluating loans and planning for the future with investments are all discussed",4

61106,Wish I had learnt these 10 years ago when I was a student at Uni. Well presented class and great for students.,4
61107,Very nice to start understanding investment basics.,4
61108,A broad and inspiring course.,4
61115,"I enjoyed the course as it was nicely structured even though most is just general knowledge. The other thing was that you have to buy the certificate, other courses offer at least certificate of participation for free. Good luck to everyone. Thanx.",4
61118,Too basic!!!,4
61119,Excellent course !! wish it was completely generalisable to all countries not only u.s.,4
61120,Basic but complete,4
61121,"Cool course, interesting but simple.",4
61126,"Interesting course for those who want to learn a bit about managing their money, credit/debit cards, loan, insurance...generally everything we need when planning/reorganizing our life.This course can be easily taken by someone who's not familiar with economics/finance.",4
61133,Good course I enjoy it,4
61139,Great course! Very insightful!,4
61167,very detail teaching and very good instructor.,4
61169,Very interesting and challenging. Thank you so much Dr. White and to all the Course Management. You taught me a lot.,4
61173,Tough but it's worth it. Neuroscience is pretty fun!!,4
61175,Really detailed course but super medical (obviously) rather than anything too cognitive. I'd strongly recommend being very confident with biological sciences and chemistry to do this course.,4
61233,"Lots of self study required by anyone from a non-biology/medical background. This is a very interesting topic, and is a good course.",4
61261,Very helpful course indeed.,4
61263,This MOOC is probably a bit too much of a rehash of the previous ones offered in the specialization. It is however of good quality and includes some interesting interviews of a few,4
61269,It was a great experience!,4
61275,"Hope to have more reference to research, all in all great course Thank you a lot!",4
61282,"The course was pretty well without problems, flaws bugs, so all went well and it achieved its stated aims in my opinion. I was beta-testing, so to say few or almost zero problems is high praise.",4
61286,"An in depth explanation of how to use Excel for Linear Regression and what the Output values in Excel's Regression mean. Note that the transcripts/subtitles contain many errors, which can be problematical for the hard of hearing or non English speakers, which is why I gave the course only 4 points.",4
61288,The exercises included help a lot in practically understanding the matter. I did not find that in other courses and it was a miss.,4
61291,I loved this course-But I should preffer it without the pinyin!only Chinese characters for the tests :D,4
61294,"The course was really good. I've studied Chinese in China for three years and I still learned so much from this course. I also got a lot of new vocabulary. Things to improve: the conversations need to be louder, the teacher is sometimes standing in front of the words so they're hard to see, the grammar could use a little more explanation. Overall, it's a good course. Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make it happen!谢谢你们。",4
61308,Very usefull!,4
61314,good information.,4
61317,I found the course to be very informative and I learned a lot. The reading was very intense but very good.,4
61318,"Structured course with very good information, but sometimes it felt superficial. I know 4 weeks is very short time to fulfill tons of topics on this course, but i think you can push students a bit more.",4
61320,The course was very interesting and inspiring,4
61323,"really enjoying the course, good information presented well and access to excellent reading materials",4
61329,Great course!,4
61333,Great foundational course for gaining familiarity with the concepts of online/digital marketing. A couple more practical applications (explained through a recent case study or interview with a practicing marketer) would take the course right up there to a 5-star rating.,4
61339,Great introduction to Marketing Analytics. I think it needs a little more examples.,4
61340,nice and informative course,4
61349,Great Course!,4
61350,It is a great fundamental course.,4
61353,"for a novice, it is fairly informative, additional case studies would make it all rounded.",4
61359,The course was very informative and exposed me to modern ways of marketing. I learnt how to set metrics for the different ways information is presented on the internet. I learnt about how there are three moments of truth when a consumer decides to make a buy decision. I particularly appreciated the ZERO moment of truth.,4
61370,"Great reads, a good course to start with to understand the basics of digital marketing and analytics.",4
61377,"Very good course. Interesting content, great suggested readings, very good instructor, and well explained lectures. I have no previous knowledge about the subject and I have learnt a lot about Marketing Analytics in both course Marketing Analytics in Theory and In Practice.",4
61394,Learnt new things. Reading material is good. Instructor clearly explains the concepts.,4
61399,"Great content, nice presentation but Coursera website is slow, especially the submission step is unstable.",4
61400,It was a good course. Concepts like ZMOT and CDJ were the most interesting topics in these course !! Thanks.,4
61407,"Great content. I would have preferred it if we had gone through a real example. None the less, it was a great course I definitely found the consumer decision journey model and the ZMOT very insightful.",4
61408,Very insightful.,4
61409,Great course!,4
61413,"I really enjoyed to learn new things, understand the analytics behind the marketing",4
61415,It's great to learn from the Head of Google Analytics.,4
61417,"Some contents are overlapped, especially Lesson 7 feels like a recap of all previous lessons.Tool list is really helpful.Other examples could be written in more details.The narrative is easy to follow, reasonable pace of speech",4
61419,"Very useful information, even for someone who already has some background on this matter.",4
61420,"very cool stuff, although the content could be a bit more compressed for this course and the next, I have the feeling that there are many redundancies and stuff that comes more than once",4
61423,Excellent course with concise and well articulated content.,4
61424,"I felt that the information in this course was very helpful, but that the modules were a little redundant. It seemed that 2 weeks of material was stretched into 4 so that Theory could be one course and Practice could be another. I am in the midst of Practice now, so my opinion may change and this may not be a fair assessment.",4
61433,"Very good instructor and good structure and pace to the class. Would have liked more real-life examples, and would have liked peer review questions that required more thought and strategy behind them. ""Which channel do you like more"" isn't really that intriguing a question. Instead, a different question could have been ""How might you leverage each channel for different purposes?""",4
61434,"Very Informative, a little dry however",4
61448,Very interesting and well supported,4
61451,More than excellent,4
61455,Interesting course and good basic knowledge! I wish we had more practice though.,4
61466,"If you have slightly dabbled in the digital marketing space, you have probably come across what you will learn in this class. But overall, it was a very good beginner course.",4
61469,"I liked this class. I have mixed feelings about this course not using due dates. On the one hand it's stress-free because I'm not penalized if I don't finish the assignment in a timely fashion. But at the same time, I'm less motivated to complete everything. Luckily I am a completionist so I did everything I needed to complete the class. But I can't say the same for everyone...",4
61477,Not so good! There is much water,4
61479,Excellent information and presented in an easy-to-understand format. My only reason for not giving this course five stars was how many examples and details were out of date and not current to today.,4
61487,"great course, very good insights about the new marketing reality",4
61492,Professor have in-depth experience in the field which make the course very interesting!,4
61493,"Good introduction into the material. It's great how rating other students' writeups helps you penetrate the material yourself, especially since there are no right or wrong answers.",4
61503,Nice explanation about need and its different aspect of Digital Analytic s.,4
61507,"Great course. Sometime too easy, sometime a little bit boring. Actuality of recommended reading (Web Analytics Demystified, 2004) is under question IMO.",4
61509,Awesome course.,4
61512,"This course delivered a lot of good, practical information on how to work with digital analytics to improve customer content, engage with customers and potential customers, and use quantifiable data for decision making. Take it to improve your understanding of digital analytics.",4

61515,"Basic, but good knowledge",4
61526,"Not very demanding, straightforward, insightful.",4
61530,"It's a great topic, but some topics and links are off to date, You need to update some topics and links.Also the Professor Rhiannon Clifton should try to read less and explain a little bit more.But in general, it was a good course, I learned a lot.",4
61532,Really enjoyed this course. It was relevant and showed some new landscapes that I could use in my career.,4
61533,Great sources of information and nice selection of articles. I enjoyed taking this course.,4
61547,need more video oriented lecture.,4
61557,"Covers the topics of both digital and traditional marketing channels:-Radio, Television, Newspapers, Magazines, Out-of-Home Media-Social Medias, Blogs, Websites, Streaming and other online platformsROI (Return over Investment), Consumer Decision Journey, Digital Marketing Evolution",4
61558,It has to be more practical oriented with real-time exercises to gain valuable skills,4
61563,Definitely worthwhile for the content-- a bit difficult to follow due to the professor.,4
61564,Quiet informative and good course. It's worth taking the course.,4
61572,"I think it is a good MOOC, but is the less interesting mood of the specialized course. Still, it has a lot of information, and extra sources that help me. The teacher seems a little confused some times an use to distract me.",4
61575,"The course was harder than the other courses offered. However, it was a great added learning experience to have. The concepts taught were very eye opening to the real world and how large companies function in the current fast paced era.",4
61581,Very nice concepts which helped me to understand the topics nicely.,4
61589,Pretty good course,4
61595,"The slides were too brief, felt presenter at times was reading off a script which made some of the lectures less interesting to follow.",4

61646,Very good course to go through as a beginner in Digital Marketing.,4
61649,"Great course, Thank you!",4
61659,"This course, as well as part 2, is a great opportunity to put things in order. Modernity, the Enlightenment, shaped our present and the course does a great job in acquainting with the basic thinkers of this period. My only improvement proposal is to make access to texts easier by providing handouts in e-book format.",4
61709,"Hey,Was a learning course. Ben learned more about the treatment time. I simultaneously following a different course on art: Gogh History of Impressionism which was about the same period.Regards Frank Terpoorten",4
61711,"Prof. Roth has covered a great many schools of philosophical thought...which, in turn, as driven me to look up more information out of curiosity. He takes an often-difficult course of study, and makes it not only easier, but makes it enjoyable.",4
61713,"The presentation of Kant's philosophy is quite inaccurate. All in all, though, this is a great course!",4
61716,Very interesting lectures. I found this to be a very good learning opportunity. The professor has a very good grasp of his topic.,4

61822,pretty good touch on the fundamentals of charting using matplotlib~great course in the series as usual... thank you!,4
61836,"good lectures and theory. I miss automatic code evaluation and more numpy data transformations. I suck at these and I was hoping this course would have more of the same kind of tasks as the first + plotting.Overall, good class as a starter point for plotting in pandas.",4
61847,Great training in matplotlib and the plotting experience.,4
61848,Excellent course to begin matplotlib. It shows us the intricacies of the matplotlib by showing the basics and prodding us to go deeper by reading the documentation. The assignments are also really good. Recommended!,4
61849,Nice material and instructor. Thanks a lot!,4
61860,"This a pretty good introduction to plotting libraries in python. I would have preferred a deeper dive into some of the built-in methods. A little more on visualizations from libraries like seaborn, bokeh, or plotly would have been nice. Overall, great work.",4
61861,"I learned quite a lot about plotting, especially in Python. However, there was a bit too much theory (Cairos principles etc) for my taste.",4
61862,"Good intro to plotting, charting and visualization in Python. Focuses mainly on matplotlib. I feel good about the content that I learned, but also feel like I wanted to learn more in this class. Maybe more coverage of other python charting libraries. More examples of financial type charts -- High/Low/Open/Close etc.",4
61864,I found the lectures interesting and thorough yet short and to the point.,4
61874,"excellent course. Unfortunately i lacked the algebric basis to follow and completely understand all the exercises and examples given. I followed all lessons trough the end, but was not able to do the test flight and complete it. but i will try again in future, when my algebric skills are better",4
61885,"Here you will learn the basic skills for writing and judging proofs.At core, the taught material consists of the content of Keith Devlin's book 'Introduction to Mathematical Thinking', which is available for low fee. But at this course are come lots of students together and they can help each other at struggling through the plenty exercises which accompany the lectures. And there is also some help from several mentors.In the last week you have to write your own proofs at ten problem sets and peer reviewing them for lots of other students.negatives: Because the instructor suggested group building over the net, It happened at my course that the course participants was split to plenty small groups. And although it's a pretty good Idea that the Instructor presents the learning stuff at the videos by writing it on a small sheet with a pen, his handwriting is sometimes so terrible that it's hardly to read.",4
61892,"Excellent course, introducing a difficult concept very well",4
61896,"A very enjoyable introduction to proofs, number theory, and some real analysis.",4
61925,the course outline really equips an individual on how marketing is a core part of business,4
61940,"Well presented with reasoned arguments, some of the slides needed to be clearer especially the maps",4
61944,"Better way of showing how finance,politics and war can interact with each other.",4
61955,Worth your time !,4
61964,Very interesting and engaging,4
61981,I found Part Two much easier to follow because I stopped taking notes. The professor's speaking style is so informally formal that it's easy to understand and remember. His passion for history is obvious when you combine looking and listening.,4
61983,Very enjoyable and informative. I'd certainly take other courses by the same professor!,4
61984,"The teacher was rather informative, he analyzed the subject to its detail i am very satisfied.",4
61996,I think the course content is global history US in center.,4
62027,Deep views. The why part o things is something very special.,4
62038,It´s a very excellent course of history!,4
62040,Well created lectures with clear ideas.,4
62045,Great Course!,4
62046,"The course explains in very simple ways the essentials for understanding how companies actually perform, although it would be helpful if they used more examples to explain the ratios.",4
62048,It was a great experience. This course help me understand the components of financial statements,4
62052,it was a great experience.,4
62055,"This course is much better put together than the one on company position (balance sheet). It's still not terribly in-depth, but as an overview for those unfamiliar with accounting, it has quite a bit of good information.",4
62064,A good informative course. Very useful and futuristic,4
62070,"very nice and organized course, I wanted to give it 5 starts but its missing the interactionI did not feel the class room with students, where I wished to know new people and exchange experiences. Thank you very much.",4
62074,其实可以更加to the point 一点,4
62079,The course is fascinating. Abundance of examples and cases studies makes it stand out. Definitely lots of insights and fresh thoughts on a topic.,4
62083,Great Introduction! Thanks!,4
62091,I like the course.,4
62093,"Very interesting! Slightly disappointed by the peers review approach only, I would have preferred a more blended approach.",4
62095,"Very informative, interesting articles and great case studies. The combination learning works well for me!",4
62096,"I enjoyed studying the lessons and making the assignments. I don't feel comfortable with the idea of reviewing other student's tasks/projects or vice-versa since I'm not a fluent English language speaker, but I know this is the way to get grades on Coursera.I suggest updating some lessons since this course was released on 2014 and some things have changed since that year in the digital marketing field.",4
62109,"A resourceful course to start learning Digital Marketing. Courses are aligned with well crafted weekly assignments and a pace to keep up with. Overall, I had a very learned & fun experience. Thank you team.",4
62110,Good course and visionary,4
62114,"The things learnt are interesting, but do not reach my expectation. I think it can invoke more thoughtful discussions.",4
62119,Lovely course and nice start to the specialization. Lot of learning!,4
62125,Good Start for Digital Marketing Beginners.,4
62144,"Hi, how do I finish the course? I stayed in module two and I would like to finish the course. Thank you",4
62151,"some of the material needs update, like the Redlaser case.otherwise, this course changed my perception about online learning. It was interactive and the case studies were creative.",4
62153,"This course might look lengthy from the course outline but is rather easily digestible if you stick to a schedule. Do it anyway, it's worth your time if you are serious about a career in digital marketing.",4
62155,I enjoyed the course a lot and will encourage executives (marketing or not) to consider opening their perspective about marketing and the digital works. I will ask that some practice examples be updated to revalidate the strength of some new concepts (digital marketing is STILL considered relatively new domain to MANY). It will also make the course close to participants with fresher examples.,4
62158,"This was a good course,Professor Erik did a great job of using relevant case material to highlight course objectives. This was my first coursera course that I signed up for and completed. Great way to be ""introduced"" into the MOOC program.",4
62168,It was a very good experience but the examples used should be current time and should not be outdated ones.,4
62186,Useful information for an introductory course to Digital Marketing. Study cases are interesting and engaging! Some topics are more related to IT than marketing itself. Would be great to update some of the reading resources since they are from 2012.,4
62189,"I very much enjoyed the course because it is really based on ""learning by doing"" . I have enjoy the practical cases, although some of them are not applicable in Europe.",4
62202,"It was good., O learnt a lot from this course but it need to be up to dated.",4
62208,Great learning experience!,4
62212,"Really good course! I liked the structure, the materials, and most assignments. I felt like I gained valuable knowledge; this is a good introduction to marketing today!",4
62221,Like this coerce but some more topic should be added in first week. this can be cover within 3 days.,4
62228,"Very Useful, Interesting, Many thing new to learn, Highly recommended.",4
62229,interested for how working in Marketing Filed .,4
62230,A very good way to kickstart your studies in digital marketing,4
62233,I believe this is a well rounded course that gives a detailed overview on digital marketing. Its mostly for awareness and building knowledge rather than acquiring a specialized skill.,4
62234,"Excellent course in terms of content, but being evaluated by colleagues is very painful because there are always people too competitive and not at all friendly in the feed-back",4
62235,"The course covers the foundation of Marketing in Digital World. However, the course will be better if Mentors get involved more in the case study discussion and peer review",4
62236,"I really enjoyed the course as a primer to how firms are using new digital technology to change the traditional marketing mix. The materials were well organized, easy to follow and helpful in learning the theories presented. The content was great.One element of the course structure I don't care for is the peer graded assignments. I completed the four week course in 7 days (I was on vacation), but I've had to wait three more weeks for everyone else to catch up with me so I can grade their assignments. (You can't progress until you've graded three other students.) I also do not like that the grading is not blind, so you know exactly how your peers graded you and they know how you graded them. Not sure that merits the most honest grading results. If you grade someone honestly and they feel it was unfair or harsh, they may grade you harshly the next time. A blind system would allow honest feedback and ensure more truthful grading.",4
62239,"While thanking Prof. Aric and my peers for a good experience on the course, I must say that this has been a great learning opportunity and I am looking forward to sign up for the next course and onward until I complete the specialization.",4
62240,A diff perspective at Dig Mktg.,4
62244,Great course that gives a fresh look on marketing.Although few exercises should be reviewed and updated.,4
62252,"Very simple. Almost too simple. Fortunately, this seems to be an intro course, as the next courses in the specialization are much more specific with better content.",4
62254,Very useful,4
62258,It was an interesting introduction into the world of Digital Marketing,4
62266,"That's a excellent course for begginers, we learned how to inniciate in the Digital world and how to use it the best way. There is interesting read suggestion and cases studies that push you into the world.",4
62276,good class,4
62287,"Great course for general understanding of neuromarketing concept, tools, etc. But in a number of cases, proposed reading and some of the video content (eg. interviews) are too academic.",4
62288,"Very interesting and well-organized course, but some information is out-of-date.",4
62293,good course thanks coursera,4
62298,"Overall the course was good, but some of the materials were not recent. i wish the most recent trends were included",4
62300,REVIEW YOUR PEERS IS A INNOVATIVE IDEA.,4
62302,A very good and clear intro to the subject.,4
62303,"I find the information provided here to be very spot-on, clear and transparent, innovative and interesting. Yet, I would have loved it if it were the professor of the course the one who checked and graded our assignments, as there would be less chances that ge'd be biast. Anyways, I understand the whole idea and the fact that one cannot check all the assignments submitted in here, as there are maybe thousands of them :).In conclusion, I found it very interesting and challenging, therefore I am about to begin Course no. 2 from this Digital Marketing Specialisation course. Thanks and cheers!",4
62307,"I enjoyed this course and appreciated the fact that not all the assignments were multiple choice. It was great to be able to develop ideas through the case studies and exercises. I would have liked if actual TA's would review our work instead of other classmates, but I realize this might be unrealistic due to the high number of people enrolled in the course.",4
62315,remarkably well taught and full of refreshing insights .,4
62318,Great value for money! You need this course if you want to upgrade your knowledge of the digital Marketing Mix,4
62321,very very useful n knowledgeable.,4
62327,"This course was a very informative intro not only to digital marketing, but also to marketing as a whole for those who may not be ass familiar with the basics of marketing. I'm looking forward to taking the rest of the specialization.",4
62328,Very helpful for people who want to learn the usefulness and concepts of digital marketing.,4
62331,"The concepts are excellent, but I was a little taken back that the content examples, required reading and/or case studies were dated. Perhaps the best research and case studies are 4-5 years old. I thoroughly enjoyed reading them and learning from them. I guess the reason I didn't give the course 5 stars is because I expect at least one reading or case study pre module (ideally) to be published within the last 12 months. Overall it was really fun and informative and I will be taking more classes. All the best...Stephanie Schreurs",4
62334,very informative course. was great studying with prof.aric!,4
62339,"Nice Course to understand the nuances of new digital tools that will be the future of Marketing Field. As a Marketing Manager, this course has updated my knowledge in the changing digital paradigm.",4
62340,"I am very satisfied with this course!I'm not a native english speaker, though it was very clear and comfortable to deal with the course and to understand the material.I feel that I gained relevant and important knowledge.The only ""weakness"" I see in this course is that it's not challenging enough. The requirements are a bit too low, the quiz level is too easy and it can be retaken with no limit. Thus, It feels that everyone can get the certification without putting too much effort - and that lowers the course value.",4
62345,"It's an awesome course. I recommend this course to all those who want to pursue the career in Digital marketing. Apart from that, it's very easy to learn and the assignment are very interesting. I guarantee youwill definitely enjoy this course and i recommend you to take all 6 of them.I rate it a 4 star only because the course study must be updated a bit. Else i would have given it a 5 star.",4
62347,"I found this course really fascinating. The key concepts, academic insights, exercises and assignments; all contributed towards real world and practical learning experience.",4
62349,"Great introductory course. There are bad audio and editing misses, but as a course itself was fun and interesting.",4
62350,This class certainly forced me to think about the future of marketing and traditional retail.The peer reviewed grading system left something to be desired.,4
62352,Valuable class for discovering high level digital trends impacting commerce. Detailed look at how digital is changing the marketing mix. Fairly complete overview. (Mostly geared toward B2C commerce.),4
62364,"Wonderfully designed course. Great insights about co-creation, pwyw and other concepts. Thanks to the instructor for wonderful exercises. They were really relevant.",4
62367,Good content but would have preferred if it was more interactive. There is no way to discuss in detail and debate over a topic. I still have many questions unanswered and forum is very inactive. Wish there was a thread for each topic where people could just discuss their perspective. Overall good content but lack of interaction makes it incomplete in my opinion.,4
62371,Wonderful Course. Everything explained nicely along with examples to describe each concepts elaborately.,4
62375,This was a highly insightful and relevant course for a marketing neophyte such as myself. Kudos to Professor Rindfleisch for explaining the subject matter with consummate perspicuity.,4
62380,Well Detailed and helpful content,4
62385,I enjoyed doing this course. It lays out the basics in such a structured way that is easy to understand and apply even if a person has no background in marketing. It is a great foundation course.,4
62386,Excellent format of online education. Participative and top graded content,4
62392,Great course. Highly recommend for those who want to refresh their marketing knowledge but in a digital context and for beginners.,4
62396,"Great course, very satisfied especially with the readings part and interviews with other people that are involved professional in this area!",4
62401,"Interesting introduction to the topic, but some of the material is obsolete (for example, the web pricing module). Perhaps that can't be entirely avoided in the rapidly changing world of digital marketing, but it was a bit of a disappointment.",4
62404,"Very nicely organised course. With student interviews, and discussions with industry leaders the course provides a very insightful introduction to marketing in the digital world.",4
62406,"The content of the course is very good. What I would improve are the Quizes; I'd concentrate more on key stuff, not include any questions concerning irrelevant details. Some of the assignment questions were also a bit unclear and the rating scales did not make sense at times.",4
62407,"It's a great course, but you have to pay to access a lot of functions.",4
62408,"Some of the reference materials might need updating (but perhaps there are no better studies to share at this point), but overall found this an interesting application of the traditional 4Ps of marketing to the digital world.",4
62416,Very good course! Highly recommended for someone with no background in marketing.,4
62421,This was a very good introduction class to Digital Marketing.,4
62425,Great introduction to Digital Marketing. I was able to obtain great insights on how the digital world impacts Marketing and consumer behavior.,4
62429,"Really liked the flow of content and the instructor. Some content is dated (RedLaser) and makes one assignment clunky since it was based on that app. Since this course focuses on digital and the inherent speed-to-market the platform affords, one would expect more up-to-date/timely examples for current content/exercises. Aside from that, the course was engaging and informative. Thanks, Aric!",4
62432,Valuable basic knowledge to introduce you to Digital Marketing.,4
62435,Not a very difficult one. but you definitely learn a lot from peer assessment.,4
62436,"Great Insight, a very good course to review the 4P model with a digital lens!",4
62438,"I undertook this marketing course as a marketer keen to make sure I was up to date and thinking about new ideas. It was a shame redlaser.com is no longer active, however I'm sure there are other tools, the course content just needs to be updated. I liked the Quad elements but found the Quizzes a bit frustrating particularly when they asked questions for which the answer was covered in the next topic. Overall however, time well spend. Thanks to Aric and team.",4
62442,Easy to understand and participate!,4
62455,This course is great. Very interesting world of digital marketing out there that i wasn't aware existed. Found some new great things in the world thank you so much for sharing!,4
62462,They need to re-write the RedLaser module since RedLaser is no longer a thing. That was SO CONFUSING to figure out that I was very last-minute with that assignment; I had to go to Walmart to do it properly because it was still open that late Sunday night.,4
62463,Very good course and I would absolutly recommend it to each and every one who has intrests in marketing. Moreover the teacher is quite brilliant and very good in delivering concepts.,4
62475,"Good course, clear and easy to understand some exercises were outdated as red laser doesn't exist any more",4
62476,Very good insights. Thanks. I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and learnt a lot.,4
62480,it helps me to know what are the latest advances in the digital world and how that change the marketing four p's,4
62481,"Interesting content, practical exercises and well structured.",4
62491,I have learned something new.,4
62505,Very useful,4
62515,"Learned the fundamentals of marketing with a digital slant. The most interesting portions of the class were interviews with experts in the field. Appreciated that the professor replied to comments I made throughout the course. The peer-reviewed grading for assignments was problematic because the explanation of the grade didn't align with the percent grade. Overall, I'd recommend this course for a great foundation to marketing.",4
62518,"A good teacher!! Is helpful! And he explain clear and consise, i recomend this course!",4
62519,Great class with good case studies. Aric is great teacher,4
62530,"Love the practical recommendations given by the professor and the course basing itself on research and case studies instead of 1 textbook. However, the professor's nonverbal communication (palms down) can be a tad unpleasant.",4
62542,This course have helped me to learn the marketing mix in digital landscape.,4
62543,The content is great and the professor is excelent to engage the audience.The excercises are focused to the practise of theory presented during the videolectures.,4
62546,Excellent !!! Informative and direct,4
62547,Packed full of real world case studies and concepts! We had a very good idea of how to apply these concepts as well. There were also well-designed assignments to trigger our thinking and knowledge synthesis.,4
62560,"Good class, with interesting points ans assignments and very god teacher",4
62563,Great insights from the lectures,4
62571,"I really enjoyed this course and I liked the variety of videos as well as ""special lessons"" with professionals from different fields.The exercises supported studies and gave better understanding of the tools.However, I believe some of the lessons (or videos) were a bit off from topic or gave too much focus on the issues that, I believe, are not that much related to the course purpose. (e.g. too much of 3D printing).Overall, it is a great course and I was pleased to participate in it!",4
62577,Great attitude and real life cases!,4
62586,I really enjoyed it. thankyou.,4
62587,"Interesting case studies, and a lot of usable information",4
62589,"Great course overall, good lectures and good exercises",4
62594,Very insightful class. Certainly would need an update on 3d printing as well as virtual reality development,4
62605,I liked the course a lot. Very interesting!,4
62607,"It has great content but assignments are promotions... Like, really, shamy promoted assignments.",4
62616,"Enjoyed the course, especially the awesome research work by other professors.However, was expecting a more content heavy course, which is a part of the full specialization, kinda unaffordable for me :(Anyways, great course, loved it! :)",4
62617,Its in Detail and the professor teaching it is also speaks clear.,4
62620,This very interesting useful and inspiring course! I am enjoying it very much! Thank you!,4
62623,Very informative. Lots of new and novel concepts introduced.,4
62632,Thank you Aric and his team for giving us such an opportunity to learn about digital marketing.I am very much happy to say that i enjoyed your lectures very much and it has definitely changed the way i used to think about marketing.,4
62634,good course but need more assignments,4
62642,"The course provides a good foundation in understanding the impact of digital technologies on business and how marketing is undergoing a shift. The course uses the popular marketing mix framework of 4Ps - Product, Promotion, Placement and Price and shows the effect of digital on each using theory, examples, case studies and exercises.",4
62645,Hands on courses combining short theories and studies overview with practical examples and exercices.It is a very good introduction of the impact of the digital world on the marketing.,4
62649,Lacks depth but gives a good overview of the different aspects of Digital transformation. worth doing,4
62650,"the basics for understanding the analytics of digital data, great value",4
62654,Excellent course with the Ari in lead.,4
62660,Very interesting curse. It would be nice if yu can add sme examples from outside the US.,4
62664,"Loved this course. It gave me a great introduction to current concepts and trends in Digital Marketing. I was especially impressed by 3D Printers. I hope to visit a hub in my own city soon to try it out!Only suggestion is reduce the number of weekly workload. Too many assignments to complete in a single week! Most courses in Coursera give only one assignment per week. I was able to manage as this was a self-paced course. So this is not a complaint, just a suggestion :)",4
62668,This is an excellent course which extends knowledge about the various marketing strategies that firm are adopting in this changing digital world.,4
62680,"It an amazing start and i really admire Julie and Professor for putting so much of effort in creating the course in a super structured way , I taking the further modules since i liked the opening so much.",4
62691,"The course is a good introduction to the Specialization and the topic in general. It could be a bit more structured (like the courses that follow) but overall, as an introduction, it works.",4
62698,"Interesting course, especially for the people who are planning to do their further studies in Marketing, (Post graduation/ Phd)",4
62705,"That's a good course. A little bit repetitive if you have already studied about MKT. But it presents new concepts, interesting cases and give you some updates about what is happening in the market regarding the 4Ps.",4
62706,good course,4
62708,I´ve been enjoyed very much the course. I´ll do the others ones to have the specialization,4
62709,This was a good course though I feel there could have been a little more professionalism in terms of camera work and testing that apps and services truly were available to all students globally.Al in all a very insightful course that opened my eyes to some technologies and processes I was not yet aware of.Thank Aric Rindfleisch,4
62712,"Great course in general, with minor issues on exercises Starbucks and Redlaser which is hard to complete if you are not in US. Thanks a lot!",4
62713,"Basic, but good knowledge",4
62714,"a very interesting course, with many examples and assigment that ask you to apply drectly what you learnt. Thanks !!!",4
62723,Very interesting course!,4
62725,"Well organized, great and helpful assignments, and a fantastic teacher: Aric Rindfleisch!",4
62726,great and knowledgeable course.,4
62729,Overall a very good course. Great academic perspectiv. Just need to update some exercises to compensate for web changes.,4
62731,"I think this course is interesting and informative. I have progressed into the second week, and the expositions of digital marketing techniques are interesting and fairly detailed. I would recommend this course to gain an understanding of traditional and newer advertising strategies employed by companies.",4
62744,thanks for your dedicated effort,4
62754,I would like a little explanation about coloring,4
62755,The end section for assembling the comic feels a bit outdated. And I would have liked an option for learning or practicing with choosing layouts for the comic.,4
62757,"Lots of great reference information available in this course that is constantly being updated. The course forces you to finish your project so at the end of the course you have something done which is a 16 panel comic. Doing a cover for your small comic book is optional.It was fun to do for me. I'd give it 4.5 stars if it would allow such scoring. My only complaint is that the course seemed rushed and too short for all that you need to cover and create in some weeks.I still would not hesitate to recommend this course because it is complete. All that is necessary is some very basic supplies. Photoshop may be needed to complete the final week, but I worked around that issue as I think some others in the course may have done as well.",4
62758,"Very good course. Maybe a few pointers on actual drawing would be helpful, especially for people like me who really have a handicap, or at least",4
62761,"Really enjoyed this course and I learned a lot. The content is interesting, engaging and informative. I now feel confident to get started on the graphic novel I've had in mind for some time, as well as starting a webcomic archive. I would recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in making comics. It's a great kick starter!Only reason I haven't given 5 stars is I was expecting it to be more compatible with digital methods of creating art. The course is structured to use hard copy printing and actual pens/pencils/inks, whereas I use a Wacom tablet and pen with Sketchbook Pro. So I had some fiddling around to do to access the course materials in a format that was useful to me. Also, the final week instructions seemed to be directed at a class putting their comics together in a compendium for the final print. I found it a bit confusing.",4
62776,Generally quite good in reviewing a multitude of aspects. I did miss not having my responses evaluated even though I decided just to audit this course. On almost all occassions others courses let you evaluate your learning as you go so this was disappointing.I did purchase Bloom's book which I find easy to read and very complimentary to the course.,4
62782,"Great, but sometimes too long.",4
62783,Interesting. Kind of fun.,4
62784,"The course was very well organised, setting good example of the standards Yale University presents.Paul Bloom did an excellent job with every lecture; My focus was never lost.The only improvements I can think of, which is why the fifth star was not given, are: proper maintenance of links for the required reads (two of them did not work for me) and maybe include more questions throughout the lecture (add a greater sense of interaction with the lecturer).",4
62787,"You'll need to pay to take the quizzes, which is a bummer, but over all a very interesting, well done, and thought provoking look into morality and how we define what is moral.",4
62793,It seems the teacher was under the influence of psychological drugs. He lacked the qualities of humans.,4
62802,Great course. Thank you Professor Bloom and your associates.,4
62809,"Very engaging lecturer. I would have preferred the course to be a little more challenging, with perhaps a final exam or some extra readings. Nevertheless, highly recommended.",4
62813,A good well organized course; but I was already familiar with much of the material.,4
62829,"This course gave me the toughest time of my life. I did the course for 3 months, i failed project once but i thank God, i proved toughest by passing with 100%.",4
62831,This is great course as Intro to Statistics,4
62836,Its a very good way to introduce to R language,4
62844,Very useful tools for inference,4
62858,good powerful insight into statistics. Thanks!,4
62869,"Some parts are needed more clarification. In other words, as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials, since the materials are not self-sufficient. Specially about simulation methods. However, this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5. The absence of any help from TAs, based on my experience, is the reason. I expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course.",4
62870,Very good introductory course for inferential statistics. It is wise to complete the first course Introduction to Probability and Data of this specialization before enrolling into this one to grasp the concepts.,4
62875,"The teaching is good, the course is a little heavy and a lot to take in in the later weeks. But, as a further grounding for statistics and R, I would very much recommend it.",4
62879,Nice introduction to statistical inference concepts and techniques,4
62885,"Thorough treatment of the topics with great examples using real data. On the down side, the treatment of the mathematics behind the formulas is a little light. Great use of simulation to support the theory or to use when theoretical assumptions are not met. Strongly recommended!",4
62899,"A great refresher course for math. Depending on which way you look at the course it is either 4 or 5 stars, I wish I could give 4.5 for this reason! I'm not sure if it would be wholly sufficient for people new to mathematics trying to get into business/MBA as there needs to be more examples and problem sets. There could also be some PDFs added to further reinforce learning. However I still rate this course highly because I had no experience with matrices but through the videos as a sole resource I got a perfect score on the quiz on the first time. If you have a maths background you'll find this course the perfect refresher for exploring your MBA options.",4
62900,thank you,4
62909,"It was very good, specially the new skills about showing cause/effect and explaining graphs. Also, the reading strategies are a plus.",4
62912,"A good oportunity to learn business English, communication and much more.",4
62917,Good Course,4
62925,Very good. I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot.I would have liked that it had included r as one of the softwares.,4
62927,"Excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression, lasso regression and k-means clustering. A background in Python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples.",4
62930,"Excellent course, some basic tecniques of Machine Learning are implemented in Python and SAS.",4
62942,More examples in coding and results are expected. So it is more convenient for students to compare different results and understand deeper,4
62943,I would like to have an opportunity to contact my reviews.,4
62962,Sometimes boring and I felt like the quizzes were just worded in a tricky way rather than really assessing learning. Otherwise fine.,4
62965,I would like only 1 question wrong be acceptable as in the first course - I appreciate when the certificate confirms rigor and value.,4
62967,"Very good, thorough and interactive course on portfolio management and construction!",4
62994,Good course with valuable and relevante examples and explanations,4
62996,I enjoyed this second course in the series.,4
62997,"Cover plenty of material regarding to the subject.Although it takes some assumptions that are not unanimous about stock investment, specially about returns from actively managed stocks (it assumes one can beat the market).",4
63000,"It is great and helpful, but I think it is kind of needed to be updated such as unavailable links to materials and some errors on the textbook.",4
63001,"Overall a great course with relevant use of material. Suggestion for improvement-the balance scorecard. Knowing how that might be used in organizations would be helpful. Also, a few more case studies in the videos would be good. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to further their knowledge in decision making based accounting.",4
63010,Great Content !,4
63011,"Very good teacher! Since I am a choral conductor, I specially appreciated the interviews and advies from the choral conductor. Picked up quite a few points! i was surprised to learn that Dr. Feldman let his players sing their parts.I will definitely recommend this course.",4
63021,The course contents are great!But is such a big subject for a single course. This should be a specialisation.,4
63027,Mr. Evan Feldman explains and shows the technical asspects on a very pleasant way. The conversations with a choir conductor and an orchestral conductor gives also insights in specific ways of conducting different groups of musicians.,4
63029,Very interesting,4
63030,"Great insight into conducting for people at all levels. It's invaluable as a musician to have as many skills up your sleeve as possible and that's what this course helps with. The video lessons are quite long, but the multiple choice quizzes more than make up for that where other courses have little content and lots of complicated technology requests for submitting assignments. Perfect!",4
63043,Very comprehensive.,4
63058,"Good introduction to RTOS concepts. A little theoretical, there could have been a project to do in the end which would have made the course objectives more clear.",4
63059,It is a very good course for embedded system enthusiasts.,4
63064,"I enjoyed this course a lot! It gives a good introduction to the topic of real time systems, the lessons are well organized and you don't need to be a computer science expert to learn and understand the material taught in the course. The course not only teaches theory but gives you practical guidelines and very useful examples/assignments to illustrate how the theory is used in practice to solve typical problems and design real time systems , which is the feature I liked most about this course. This ""hands-on"" approach is very useful to the practitioner, with some inexpensive and simple hardware at your disposal the open-source software tools introduced in the course can get you quite far in designing your own real time system! Needless to say, no course is perfect and there are always things that can be improved. For example, the wording of the assignments and quizzes in this course is in dire need of an update/edit.",4
63066,The course is very good in my opinion. There are some little drawbacks though. The assignments are not very difficult but expect you to be autonomous in setting up the environments; this was a bit of a hurdle for some students. Also the reviews could be better. The review feedback depends on how well the reviewer understood the subject; more concrete instructions would be good as well as more precise criterias for the grading of the peer review.,4
63068,great course. I enjoy many point about RTOS from here. Thanks ^^,4
63078,I'm not really used to online classes but the information was helpful.,4
63090,"It's an excellent course, very interesting and the presenter is an amazing teacher.",4
63091,"Very Good course.Very Good course.In my view some needed additions to be excellent. Summaries of the important issues in each lecture video can be introduced might be in a form of Power Point Presentation. This will highlight the main topics. This can be done for each video, each lesson and each module.Prof. Dr. John Budd have already made these summaries and conclusions during his video lectures, but it is not easy to retrieve when you are searching about some specific subject. You have to here again a group of videos to find what you need.",4
63093,A lot of very useful skills to be applied in the workplace. A wide scope of HR responsibilities and examples to achieve them.Only issue I had was the inconsistency of grading from peers.,4
63101,A solid introduction to HRM,4
63115,I wish the remaining courses in this specialization will be at the same level of quality.,4
63120,Very good course for introduct human resources management.,4
63136,Just taking part of the course material was rewarding. A good basic introduction to HRM,4
63140,Very good for learning.,4
63146,"Parts of this were really interesting. Ideas around high / low strategy and ensuring alignment between HR and organizational strategy and culture were important reminders. He jumped over a few important areas that may have added more value, such as employment law and managing to the law.",4
63156,Very helpful curse for people who want to discover HR World and for people who want to learn more about HR.,4
63158,"A very solid intro to how to think about HR, managing, and strategy - very broad, but well-explained and manageable!",4
63160,The proper course for me! My instructor knows to teach and he helps me to understand what is Human Resources. Thank you!,4
63161,Useful preparation for HR especially for the United States.,4
63173,Gained valuable insight that can be aplied to many industries. The concepts given were comprehensive and easy to follow.,4
63175,Overall good course. I would appreciate if the slides could've been provided. Also some external resources to further study of the topics covered would add value.,4
63182,"Very good course leading to insightful consideration for new managers. Quickly applicable with the Thought Model exercise. Would highly recommend. I give it 4 starts out of 5 because some improvement needed around expected deadlines on week 3, and for a few technical bugs: one must be logged into a browser to participate in the discussion forum - I couldn't make it work from my iPad or iPhone apps.",4
63184,loves the class and the online lectures!,4
63190,"Very good content. The lessons are clear and relevant, with good examples. The course would be ""excellent"" if the instructor would be involved with the forums and would answer questions that were posted directly to her. But I still think it is a great deal for managers to take this course!",4
63191,"Great introduction into coaching as a manager. However, it left me wishing the course had more to it and that it lasted longer.",4
63192,Really good information for people starting companies and figuring out how to lead manage future employees. Some of the videos were cut off at the end and a word misspelled on the quiz. Other than that great job keep up the great work!,4
63193,Very good audio quality and good pacing and presentation of content.,4
63199,Great perspective for new managers.,4
63206,Great course i learned a lot about coaching,4
63217,Great first part of series. Looking forward to more.,4
63234,"Well-balanced approach to basic synthesizer patches, along with a good portion of composition and arrangement. Highly recommended.",4
63236,A great course which feels way too short.,4
63241,Very informative introduction to sound creation.,4
63244,"Nice course! The teaching is excellent (5 stars), and I have learned a lot in this course. It is short but intensive.I initially planned to give only 2 or 3 stars because of several reasons, described below. But in the end I like the course a lot so I don't want to go too low.Reasons are:1) Strobe, the software synth required in the course, was hardly usable (crashing always in 64 bit mode, sometimes in 32 bit mode). Several applicants stopped the course because of this. However this was (at least for me) solved during the course (I can use it now without any problems). So that is great (but a bit late).2) The course is (as of March 2016) new and still contains many errors. The videos, as said, are excellent. But the assignments are often wrong and not accurate (actually 4 out of 4 contain errors...). In the first assignment you are asked to list favorites in 14 categories, but there are only 13. So you can never get the full points, or the reviewers should be flexible. In many of the following assignments the naming of the to be uploaded files is unclear or erroneous. It is important to fix that because reviewers are explicitly asked if the names are correct. In the third assignment it is worse, there is no room for an upload of the MP3, the final product of your whole week work which should be judged. One error was fixed during the course but in a hasty way, the most important errors are still there. Anyway, that will hopefully be fixed before the next cycle starts.3) The course is really targetted to House (or at least Dance) music. All assignments should follow a predescribed form, while I (as an amateur classical pianist) would like to create pieces not following that form, but still using synth sounds. But if you do that, you get less points or do not pass the assignments. So that is too strict (in my opinion).4) Strobe2 is central in the course. It is mainly educating for Strobe2. I tried after the course to apply the knowlegde to other synth plugins, which is possible but only in a limited way. You really learn how to do it in Strobe2, and there is no education for other synth plugins. Many concepts cannot easily be transferred. That is different from Loudon's excellent course Music Production, which was designed to be software independent.So I have several objections to the course. But some of them can be fixed, and it was still a great course, I learned a lot and I enjoyed it, and I give it 4 stars.",4
63248,amazing course,4
63254,Very good. Thank you.,4
63256,Very useful,4
63259,"Well organized, with good examples. Could be further enhanced with more",4
63260,A very insightful course. Will recommend to people who want basic knowledge in innovation,4
63261,"I general a good course, but some of the instructors were better than other",4
63266,Totally enjoyed the course and learnt a lot.,4
63269,"Great course, though one thing that is missing is recommended reading material.",4
63271,"A great introduction to many important concepts in the field.Not going deep enough into the assumptions of these concepts, why they are the dominant concepts, and what other alternative frameworks/perspectives there are. Too business-school like.",4
63275,excelent information by excelent teachers,4
63285,Great course!,4
63290,Its really Good.,4
63291,"good explanations, easy to understand",4
63292,Some concepts need more clarification/ elaborations.,4
63294,In general it was an interesting and thought-provoking course. The only minus was that we weren't able to download a pdf version of a book to which the professor kept referring. Recommend for anyone who wants to get to know the basics of economy.,4
63296,Very good to start understanding economics from zero,4
63297,Very good course . Very good real examples. That's all.,4
63311,"I expected more math from an economics course. The professor is very good at explaining and demonstrating different topics, but it would be very interesting if we see the actual math, even in details, behind all of these concepts. I think most people who take this course have passed calculus 1 and 2, so a little bit of math would make it way more interesting and useful.",4
63331,"Great course! The material is presented in a detailed way that makes it easy to understand even if you're new to economics, using a local sandwich business as a real life case study was really cool, plenty of practice questions to test your knowledge. An all around winner",4
63340,"Good presentation and performance,,,Thanks",4
63343,Very useful for a novice! Well explained music principles.,4
63344,"I had some knowledge of basic music theory, but it really helps me to understand it deeper from different aspect. T",4
63348,Fascinating course about the systems of the body. Albeit it was somewhat difficult.,4
63353,"Not very great examples provided but you certainly can still learn a lot. Also I disagree with using Vis.JS, it's a lousy library!",4
63360,Good explanaiton of how things work together,4
63361,"The course is a little chaotic and did not meet the standards of the previous 4 courses. Still useful for learning some techniques, but mainly when writing the projects.",4
63367,"Not the best of the courses in this specialisation, but as all the rest had set the bar very high!! Still learnt a lot about Meteor and how to use database in different ways! Thank You.",4
63376,"This module is a very good addition to the specialisation.In terms of sophistication of the meteor app it might be a step back, but it brings all the acquired knowledge and show how it can be put into a good use.The examples of the sound and drawing app are great to demonstrated blending responsive app with media management, while blogging and data-driven web apps are pretty much, what the modern web is all about.I did like the data driven app in particular, because it was just that cherry on a pie, that let me start the project that was from the beginning the very reason I did this specialisation.Too bad the capstone project can only be joined with official admission to the specialisations, I would definitely enjoy to develop my ""startup"" up idea as a part of the guided education process.And for now - compliments to the organisers of the course, it really can bring one from zero to ready-to-became-a-hero of the web-apps developments and myself - I'm off to learn more about d3.js and react.js ;)",4
63378,"Could have used a few more details on how to change to various other brushes (squares, circles, etc).",4
63386,Subtitles of some videos are not well done. I think we need more documentation in pdf,4
63393,"Good course, simple and easy to comprehend",4
63400,Good basic tool overview for entry level learner.,4
63405,Good course...very good basic exposure,4
63414,This course was a great informational course on the basics of market research and the market research model. I highly recommend this course for anyone who needs a refresher on the the research methods involved in data collection and analysis methods used in the industry.,4
63442,Very nice ideas and suggestions to think about and work upon.,4
63448,"Mindshift as a course was ""easy"", and ""helpful"". What i have learnt from the course can be applied to my life to make it slightly better. There is a wealth of exercises in self-help today on the internet and from books. It doesn't hurt to do this course, its well put, and you learn new things(sometimes). What you gain from this course is ultimately dependent on how much you are able to exercise the points of this course. Given the small amount of time you are investing in completing the course (it is a very low requirement course and you can finish it in 2 days if you want to, although that is not recommended), i would suggest you take it, since the investment pays off depending on how new you are to the material and how much you are able to put it to use.",4
63453,it was a great,4
63455,This is an important course for your own personal development. Personal and professional challenges have to be dealt with effectively and rationally . Take this course and enjoy new ideas and techniques for developing yourself.,4
63461,"Great content on certain important aspects of learning, especially after one is into career. In the information era, learning new stuff and keeping up with the trend is one of the most essential trait expected of a knowledge worker, and this course equips one with the right mindset for a lifetime of learning. I recommend this course for everyone who has a yearning for learning.",4
63462,Good course.,4
63475,"This is an excellent course that provided an overview of the broad scope of history of the Middle East, with an emphasis on insights into the Islamic faith over time and among Middle East cultures. This is must-have information for those who live in the Western Judeo-Christian culture.",4
63487,Thank you for a very in,4
63488,generally good but kind of not clearly formulated,4
63505,Really good course!,4
63511,Excellent professor and very interesting topic for whoever is curious to learn about these Muslim Countries! I warmly recommend it and the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that it is too long! There are many sections that can be cut out and some lectures repeat themselves but over all it is intriguing and fulfilling and I think its also very important to understand the background of these states and why they are how they are today.,4
63524,Dedicated resource person. Good reading materials. Challenging quizzes and assignments.,4
63530,"The course is very interesting, but videos are too long to be honest.",4
63536,"Excellent course.Just a shame, trying to figure out to get always the video notes only in english language and not in my natural language (currently french, detected by Coursera), which is better to understand questions & insure to get the answer. For some videos, only the notes in my natural language are available, which constraint me to translate and probably leads to misunderstandings.",4
63541,Exceptionally informative as an introduction to Islamic studies. Could do with tightening up its question and answer format.,4
63555,"The course so far is quite interesting but it can be made more intense with detailed readings and supply of book and journal material. It can also incorporate a series of reform which were took after arab Spring since, it was the phenomenon in Arab and muslim world.",4
63572,"Great class with a great teacher, but lack of a forum to discuss ideas and problems severely limits it.",4
63573,Need a discussion forum.,4
63577,"enjoyed the last weeks taking this course and assignments, I would recommend any person to take this course.",4
63581,The lessons were really interesting. However the projects could be improved I think.,4
63583,It was a great learning experience.Will be coming back for more. Thank You,4
63586,The course was good enough to cover all the basic of interfacing with an arudino and the tutor has done a good job at helping with the basic as well. I would like to thankyou for this good course,4
63588,Very good for starting with this beautiful and powerful interface! I really like it!,4
63589,This one is really a good course. Content is more difficult than the previous courses and learners have to put more effort in order to understand all aspects.,4
63594,Fairly straightforward course. Could go into more depth for each topic.,4
63606,Should have included more relevant content,4
63612,Exercises should be more challenging.,4
63615,"Really good for someone who is working with sensor, actuator, bread board for first time.",4
63616,Follow up to Arduino Platform and the C programming language.,4
63620,"Very useful course. Yet, as an electronics engineer, i felt it could have been better if it's even more detailed. Nevertheless, i strongly recommend this course to others",4
63622,"cool , i like it but if it has some thing more like sensor it was be better",4
63623,Loving this course,4
63625,Good. I wish it was more extense though. It leaves you hungry.,4
63626,very nice course...although i believe it should have had more demos and projects,4
63629,"for new people to arduino, its a good introduction but very basic",4
63633,"So good,but I think the examples should be using the Arduino IDE, writing the code, not just ""Open the example Fade...""",4
63636,Some more hands-on examples on shields will add more value.,4
63641,Nice explaination by the professor.,4
63645,"Quick overview of the Arduino platform. Since I was new to Arduino, it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively. The peer-reviewed grading process is something that can be improved.I think the course should have covered some more concepts in detail that are relevant to IoT devices - for example, interrupts and their usage, detailed discussion of the SPI protocol.Also, more elaborate treatment of how to implement security in communication over internet with Arduino would have been great.",4
63648,Nice Course but need more topics to be Covered. Thank You.,4
63649,good and very nice,4
63657,Good hands on elements. A little bit brief on important coding elements.,4
63662,Could have been much better.good for newbies!,4
63666,"This is a very basic course in using the arduino and having it communicate with various other devices. It is not a bad thing to have such a basic course exist, it is a good thing, but there are definite flaws in the course, the main ones being the grading system for the assignments and the lack of a place to go for clarification of the assignment / grading questions.Both the penultimate and the final assignments require a certain amount of extra research and learning beyond what was taught in the lectures and yet the grading instructions for the assignments did not allow for taking that into account; the grading criteria was either binary (grade of 100%, or 0) or had the possibility of a partial passing grade but without listing a number of possible criteria that would put a project into the partial passing grade category.",4
63674,"Good course. Prof. Ian is very good. Only I miss a deeper discussion, more complete examples and assignments. Thanks a lot.",4
63687,"The teacher is didactic and the material is good. But the course content is too superficial. Because of that, it is really easy to complete it in only one week or in a weekend. The second course: ""The Arduino Platform and C Programming"" and this one could be merged into one.",4
63691,IOT more examples should have been covered and also assignments for IoT would have been better.,4
63692,Recommended for all novice people that want to learn Arduino.,4
63693,"I liked that this course took the learner through using a couple of Arduino libraries and required video submission to demonstrate circuit operations for the weekly projects. It would have benefited from a few more requirements for the projects, especially the last one.",4
63695,Quite nice course. Easy going.,4
63704,Good and well structured course.,4
63706,"I feel that the course did successfully help me to get started in this area of computing. My one disappointment was the removal of the traditional forums/discussions from the main body of the course, although it was possible to discuss things in a single discussion area. This made it less easy to discuss specific questions relating to your current assignment. As before I thought the practical demos were very good. I'm pleased I took the course - I wouldn't have made such good progress working on my own.I hope the Raspberry Pi related courses reinstate the internal discussions - they add to the sense of a common goal being achieved and recover some of the things that aren't available in a MOOC where face to face student/professor interaction aren't available.",4
63714,Good overview of the arduino using practical assignments,4
63717,"I really liked the course, but I would have loved more clases and practices. Anyway, thaks for all!",4
63722,"As always, Colleen is amazing and explains very well. I liked a lot the interviews she added on the 4th week, mainly the last one where the woman mentions the skills she looks for in a candidate. I know it is demanded from us to search for extra resources and getting our hands dirty to understand how things work out, but I was expecting a bit more about the edition of the Bootstrap's css. It is not really clear for me how to check their css's and overwriting the properties we want.",4
63729,great course,4
63735,Nice and easy course for beginners.,4
63751,Thank you!,4
63755,good course,4
63759,Thanks for providing this wonderful course..,4
63773,Gave me base for Responsive Design and an excellent introduction to BootStrap3.,4
63779,the course is great but this is a little work as colleen says our hands didn't get dirty a lot but i really like it a lot,4
63786,"Good intro to Responsive Design, although the homeworks could be harder.",4
63795,"I would add some ""flexgrid"" to the course, aside bootstrap.",4
63797,Very good introductory course to responsive web design,4
63805,"Thanks, very helpful",4
63806,I think for me this is a walk over. [as at 4 June 2016 ie week 1 of the course],4
63810,It was a nice course which helps you understand basic concepts. was expecting more peer graded assignments.,4
63812,Does not go into depth on much but provides a nice introduction and reference to continue learning,4
63813,Not as difficult as I was hoping for.,4
63815,Great classVery easy to follow,4
63817,Covers the basics pretty well. This should leave you with a good understanding of what responsive design is. The Bootstrap exercises help greatly in providing that.,4
63818,"Very nice for theory of responsive design and had a lot of external links that I found very useful. I did this course with ""HTML,CSS,JS"" course from John hopkins University and it worked amazingly well with each other.",4
63821,Excellent course for anyone who wants to make sure their webpage works on different devices.,4
63823,A great course within this spezialization. Great teaching skills!But the assignments are only optional and the peer review is sometimes a little weak.,4
63824,"The course was very intersting and the Colleen was Really Wonderful.The one think that let me down is that i felt there wasn't enough material. The main ideas went again and again.Beside, I think that it was good combination between technical practice and therotical priniciples.",4
63827,"Anyone expecting to learn every subtlety of Bootstrap will be disappointed--but they deserve to be, this is a fours week course! The course introduces the concept of responsive design both through manually coding your own webpages and using frameworks, taking Bootstrap as an example.Over three short videos the instructor gives just enough for students to start using Bootstrap while also giving them the tools to continue their later independent development.Colleen van Lent is an exceptional instructor who manages to be engaging and motivating while always remaining 'human'.I am not altogether happy with the decision to make all peer reviewed assignments optional, even though I understand the reasoning. For this reason alone I have dropped my review to four stars. If you are prepared to make the effort to take full part in the optional exercises this is a five star course--it's up to you!",4
63834,Interesting course. I'll advice anyone in the marketing field to take this course,4
63853,i liked the way of teaching from this online classes. now i can go for learning advance matlab. i enjoyed classes.,4
63860,it was fun learning matlab,4
63861,"Good course overall, however I feel that giving more problems to work would be beneficial. There should be worked problems in each section so that students can gain a better understanding of how to write the code.",4
63867,Thank you for valuable knowledge.I am sure this course will be helpful to me in my future life.Thank you again....,4
63872,A very good and extensive tutorial for beginners.,4
63882,"I like this course because of its step by step explanation and real computing problems. On the other hand the last exercises is a bit boring for me especially. I hope I will finish this course . I also want to recommend to everybody who is just started to learn computing, may be you must be good in English.",4
63888,"Thanks a lot to all the teachers and assistants, you have helped me a lot. The lesson structure is clear and the explanation is easy to understand. I think it would be better if we can get some knowledge about some toolboxes.",4
63893,Great course for beginners.,4
63909,"It is a good course, you work a lot but the teachers show you enough to learn",4
63910,Some assignment are so physics related,4
63912,"I learned a lot from this course. The only thing i observed this course was lacking is that the video lectures and the homework assignments given were not perfectly in sync with each other, as the lectures did not completely cover the things we were supposed to do in assignments.",4
63927,good but more examples and shorter videos would have made me give a 5 star,4
63928,"good, i request you to kindly present a video on how to get the MATLAB sute for the course. I had learn quickly its a good type of learning i feel its like my normal college class with the best faculty. thank's to the coursera Vanderbilt university.",4
63932,This course so helpfull me in university.Thank you.,4
63933,"This is one of the best course related to computer programming that I came across. All the concepts are very well explained. Homework assignments are very much challenging. If you are a beginner, completing the homework assignments will take lot of time and will sometimes be frustrating. However, forums will be one of your best asset while completing this course. All the mentors and Instructors answer to all your concern. They will not give you the exact code for your answer, but they will guide you so that you can solve the questions. Some of the questions will be tough and may take days for you to figure out(speaking out of my own personal experience), but keep posting in the forums. So, if you are going for the course certificate then be prepared for the effort and time that will be used up to complete the Home work assignments. A good time will be to learn in your vacations, but don't stress yourself while your college is going on.Since this was only an introduction to MATLAB, you will not be learning how to create GUIs and entire softwares. Also, if you are looking forward to know how to use MATLAB on some hardwares, then you are not going to find it in this course. However, if you ask the mentors where to learn those things from, they will guide you. They also have a textbook available for the course, but I completed the course very well without it. So, it's not a compulsion, but I am going to buy it so that I have a better understanding about how to create GUIs for the code that I type.Tl;dr: This is the best course if you are a beginner and have no experience in programming, but if you are an expert programmer, you might get bored with some initial topics, but later things do start to get interesting. Also, you need to dedicate your time and effort to complete Home work assignment.",4
63962,"Useful introductory course. Assignments are helpful, though it sometimes also gets quite mathematical.",4
63970,"Easy to understand.... Just perfect for people who are new to programming. Well, to be able to finish the assignment.... you would need a little understanding of Maths. During this course, you will learn the basic understanding of programming, how computer works, and as well how to program in Matlab & some Matlab term( Basic Calculation, Matrices, Vectors, Scalar, Functions, Built-in Function, Selection, Loop, Data Type, File Input/Output ). After completing the course, you should be equipped with basic solid understanding of programming in Matlab. This may help you to build complex algorithm in the near future.",4
63991,"Very well done, I loved the lectures and enjoyed the assignments. I had no previous experience of programming and I found the explanation of the concepts very clear.The main critique for me is that ,for some of the problems, not having a background in physics might be..well..too challenging! It took me hours only to read about the theory behind the question, to find out the appropriate formula to use in the code, whilst writing the actual program was pretty quick.Other than that, I would certainly recommend the course.",4
63992,"Great course! From the lucid, well presented content, it is a joy for a beginner as well as a seasoned programmer to take home something from this course. Please do bring out an extended version dedicated to image processing, signal processing which MATLAB mainly covers :)",4
64049,Very Good Introductory Course.,4
64054,"Positive points:-this really is a beginners course, without any knowledge about coding or the syntax of MATLAB necessary.-you learn by solving the problems yourself. This gives you great insight about the thought processes necessary, about different approaches and how to realize your ideas.-Mentors are responding quickly (sometimes within a half hour) and are doing there best to help you out.Negative points:-The video lectures, although informative have a very slow paste and the earlier ones do not prepare you that well for the homework assignments. However once you get used to it you will manage to get an idea about the assignments from the lectures. Still the same problem is illustrated way too often in the same lecture. One could either add different problems or shorten the lectures a lot. With time it is possible to learn when one can skip a section but it makes it especially hard for people to start the course, since one spends hours watching videos for just learning about basic syntax in the beginning- For some of the homework assignments the mathematical part was the bigger challenge for me than the coding part, which is really frustrating when you just want to learn how to code.",4
64056,It is a wonderful course and understanding is made simple.,4
64058,Well structured course. It's an important one for specially engineers and scientist.,4
64062,Very well explained by the instructor. Coursera is a very good platform for learning.,4
64066,"it is a very good introductory course, i'm really enjoying it! however, lessons can sometimes be very slow",4
64081,"Very good course, with clear explanations of the key concepts. However, I felt hindered in being able to complete all tasks in the homeworks each week as many questions alienate someone like me with little mathematics/physics background. I feel if the questions were more general I would have been able to perform better each week. Very good lecture content though.",4
64086,explanation of details is excellent ! but speed is a few low ! and please be more advancethank you Fitz,4
64088,"So far the course appears to be very good, but the request for an upgrade after every video becomes more and more annoying as the number multiplies",4
64105,"Quite good and interesting course, I would probably add a bit more diversity is presentations, tasks etc. But even as it is now it gives a very good insight.",4
64107,"The topic is interesting, the videos are clear but the animation of forums is minimalist...",4
64108,Good lectures but lack of pratical exercises,4
64115,Good Course for the biginner,4
64127,"Excellent course that is precise, specific and unbiased.",4
64128,"The course is very interesting and has a lot of content, but it could be more structured.",4
64132,"I had an enjoyable morning to learn the modern politics of the middle east, thank you for giving me a chance learn by the course coordinators, lectureres and big thanks to coursera!",4
64137,The information given is great so far. I would like to have some more questonnaire or summaries to further implement the learned content. Thank you for your services.,4
64138,So far this has been a very interesting course.,4
64142,"The information is great and delivered in a way easy to understand. It is clear the presenter is passionate about the topic and presenting. The quizzes capture knowledge that is actually important to know. There are photos, literary sources, and many maps. However, slightly boring to watch.",4
64144,Excellent insight,4
64152,"The professor was very pleasant to listen to. The pacing was overall good, though the last few lessons have quite a bit of information packed in. My only real complaint was that I was hoping for more explicitly direct links to be made to modern events. Still, very enjoyable class.",4
64153,I have learned a lot.,4
64157,I very much liked this course. Iam reading this book:http://www.amazon.com/History-Modern-Middle-East-5th/dp/0813348331this course is a good addition. I think it is necessary to also read about the topics because the course covers a lot. Still without reading I think this is an interesting introduction to get an overview of the past centuries. One may get lost in some of de details but the teaching is very good so you will always get something out of this course.Hopefully more courses on the middle east will be available on Coursera in the future.,4
64161,"Great intro to understanding the modern middle east, although some introduction to the history of Islam, it's achievements and culture and the ottoman empire would also have been useful to understand more of an overall picture",4
64162,It is only a survey but it is enlightening and helps to understand,4
64166,"A good overview of middle eastern politics in the 18-19th century. The pace of the course is very brisk, especially if you're not familiar with imperial history, but if you do some of the readings it will be very easy to follow the pace.",4
64177,"Very informative course, but it would be better with more multimedia materials to make the history more interesting.",4
64179,This is a good course. Thanks a lot. :),4
64180,Excellent course that really expanded my knowledge of the Middle East and historical drivers of conflict and friction. Bravo!,4
64181,"I very much enjoyed the thoroughness of Dr. Susser's explaination, the slow and clear manner of his teaching and the structure of the course into small, short videos. This allowed me to complete the course in small doses through my busy",4
64200,Excellent course! Though sometimes I feel like the lectures can be redundant... But it's also good to really make sure the main points stick.,4
64206,"Extremely clear and informative. Good introduction to ML. I felt the labs could have had us write a little more of our own code, and would have been better to use non-proprietary libraries.",4
64214,Presented content is rather clear and instructors are rather easy to follow. Only the assignments are often confusing as there are questions which refer to missing content.,4
64216,The course 3 got pretty technical pretty soon. Enjoyed the first 2 courses without feeling overwhelmed. But course 3 was challenging. I suppose building the expectation of what is to come can reduce the challenge and lead to faster and more number of course completions.,4
64229,Can be more detailed.,4
64238,Excellent course that I have already recommended to a couple of people. Only annoying thing is the continued inconsistency between the Graphlab version and other versions (I use sframe with python - no graphlab) - some of the instructions are less than clear and needlessly waste time.,4
64242,"Not as evenly paced as the first two courses. Also some material was covered at a very high level, whilst I found that some explanations did not immediately build on my understanding gained through the foundation course, but rather confused it. Still a worthwhile course nonetheless. I look forward to the rest in the specialisation.",4
64256,Learnt new things.,4
64282,Good course.. Should have SVM related info too -- waiting for the promised optional videos from Prof. Carlos,4
64283,I would prefer more complex assignments and more advanced math concepts in the course. Otherwise it is great.,4
64286,could be more challengable homework!!,4
64291,wanted more sophisticated mathematics and intuition (as opposed to simpler explanations). [regression course had this ...],4
64294,"Learn more than just classification, but also learn how to understand the ideas behind classification algorithms.",4
64295,"The lectures are very well prepared and clear. With regards to the assignments: I think it will be nice to design the assignments in a way that allows people to use the language and libraries they prefer as much as possible. I would also prefer to write more of the coding assignments by myself, instead of trying to fill in the blanks in some pre-written code and complete them. That will help the students to learn a lot more.",4
64297,"Sometimes is difficult to understand the concept behind Classification because some videos are more practical than theorical, I mean it could be better to start the video explaining some concepts and then show and explan some samples and theorical issues.Thanks.",4
64300,"Good survey of the material, but assignments are superficial.",4
64306,It covers many aspects in clustering and the assignments are very helpful,4
64310,The questions are hard to understand and ambiguous though their answers are easy.,4
64313,"The good:-Good examples to learn the concepts-Good organization of the material-The assignments were well-explained and easy to follow-up-The good humor and attitude of the professor makes the lectures very engaging-All videolectures are small and this makes them easy to digest and follow (optional videos were large compared with the rest of the lectures but the material covered on those was pretty advanced and its length is justifiable)Things that can be improved:-In some of the videos the professor seemed to cruise through some of the concepts. I understand that it is recommended to take the series of courses in certain order but sometimes I felt we were rushing through the material covered-I may be nitpicking here but I wish the professor used a different color to write on the slides (the red he used clashed horribly with some of the slides' backgrounds and made it difficult to read his observations)Overall, a good course to take and very easy to follow if taken together with the other courses in the series.",4
64315,Need more content for SVM and Random Forest,4
64318,"Not as good as the previous courses in this specialization - I agree with those who have noted that this one seemed a little rushed. However, these are still the best courses I've found on Coursera.",4
64322,"The course covers many aspects of classification, with each section building on the one before. The lectures cover the theory, with a little bit of practical information, fairly well. The instructor tries to make the lectures interesting, and they are.The quizzes seem designed both to reinforce what the lectures taught and to expand on them. The quizzes, particularly those based on programming, could use proofreading by someone newer to the subject.",4
64332,good introduction,4
64335,"Very approachable material, given the diversity of classification algorithms.",4
64338,Very easy to follow and didactic. Very good material in the assignments.,4
64343,Great course materials,4
64345,Good course overall. Some difficult materials such as boosting were not clear enough and I had to look into a few online resources to really understand it.,4
64349,"Assignments were a little too easy, considering that students are expected to have taken the first two courses in the specialization. Otherwise, great course!",4
64354,"Highly recommended course, looking under the hood to examine how popular ML algorithms like decision trees and boosting are actually implemented. I'm surprised at how intuitive the idea of boosting really is. Also interesting that random forests are dismissed as not as powerful as boosting, but I would love to know why! Both methods appear to expose more data to the learner, and a heuristic comparison between RF and boosting would have been greatly appreciated.One can immediately notice the difference between statistician Emily, who took us through the mathematical derivation of the derivative (ha.ha.) function for linear regression (much appreciated Emily!), and computer scientist Carlos, who skipped this bit for logistic regression but provided lots of verbose code to track the running of algorithms during assignments (helps to see what is actually happening under the hood). Excellent lecturers both, thank you!",4
64360,It feels like it lacks certain depth.,4
64363,Simply a great course. Good intro to machine learning classifiation.,4
64369,Fantastic Course,4
64370,"Excellent course that details important concepts in supervised classification. The programming assignments can be a little easy to complete (and consequently easy to forget later), but I believe it's a well paced course and the lecture material is at any incredibly accessible pace, with options for more advanced material.One suggestion would be to include more papers for additional technical details in the lecture or programming assignments as you did with dealing with unbalanced data.",4
64371,"Not as good as the Regression Course, but still very good.While I appreciate prof Guestrin's enthusiasm, I missed a little rigor and mathematical depth of the Regression's course by prof. Fox.I learned a lot, but I feel that regression clicked with me a little better than classification.But that's probably me.In either case, the whole series are awesome so far, better, in my opinion, than Anrdrew Ng's ML course on coursera,A small suggestion would be to switch the main toolset from the Graphlab to something more common, like Sci-kit learn and Pandas.",4
64374,"This series is taught by Emily and Carlos. Course 2 was Emily and this course 3 is Carlos. Carlos takes a more practical approach by showing how things are related using pictures, trial and error, what happens when we do this vs. that. Emily on the other hand dives down into the math and actual facts. I feel Emily is more difficult overall - but once I got through it, I had a better foundation and intuition as to how things work and better overall understanding. So - giving this class 4 stars as compared to Emily's class that is 5 stars. I feel if they would mix it with Emily doing the math immediately followed by Carlos explanations it would be best. Finally - I don't feel this course on classification had as much content. We could've done more.",4
64375,"Thank you Prof. Carlos for this amazing course. You covered the topics in a very easy to understand way and the course was full of cool applications and humor! The only downside that I felt was that the programming assignments sometimes felt too easy. Even as a complete Python novice (I started learning Python with the first course), I felt the programming assignments could have been made more interesting. But in the larger scheme of things it doesn't matter because the course was really well taught and easy to understand. I'm really looking forward to the next course! :)",4
64377,Great course. I'm really looking forward to learn more about clustering in the next course since I know nearly nothing about clustering.,4
64381,"Very good content, very well explained... great course. Classification its a very broad topic but i think this is great introduction.The hands on where kinda on the easy side... but very interesting.",4
64383,"The course is definitely high-quality and the topics are covered in a good way. I'm not giving 5 stars because I would have expected SVMs and neural networks. Mentioning the many different algorithms for learning decision trees would have been nice, without necessarily focusing on each of them in depth. An entire week spent on precision/recall seems a little bit too much, without touching other metrics like F-score. Overall though a very nice course for beginners, and it definitely gives a good sense of classification challenges and approaches.",4
64386,Lack some of classical classification algorithms like SVM and Neural Netwroks.,4
64387,A good course to start learning classifications and getting exposure to algorithms. The instructor is awesome!!,4
64392,"Just one comment about how the course could be improved: the assignments should be more hands-on with fewer pieces of code written in advance. I say this is even though I am not a skilled programmer. The assignments would be a bit harder, but also a bit more rewarding.",4
64393,"The course provides an overview on classification methods in machine learning.The lectures are clear and easy to understand due to the quality of the slides and of the explanations.The limit of this course lies in the assignments: too easy if done with the provided notebooks and tools. Sometimes impossible to do with different tools (the suggested machine learning package is free for educational purposes, but otherwise it needs a license).",4
64395,Great course! However I put only 4 starts because I would like to see random forests which are not present.,4
64396,Decision trees and boosting were great.,4
64410,"good course but too much easy, can be a good review.",4
64417,"The contents are very interesting and well explained. Nevertheless, unlike the Regression module, the current one suffers of some technical problem, like slides not well formatted, noisy audio in some video, weekly work load not perfectly calibrated. Despite all this, if you are interested in the subject, you will definitely love this course!!!",4
64428,"Take you too long to come back, but the content is great. Good job",4
64443,This is a great course to learn the fundamentals of Internet Networks.,4
64449,"Clear and concise explanations for the lessons. But not for total beginners I guess, a little background on the terminologies are necessary to understand the lessons.I suggest to add more imagery to keep the lessons from being monotonous. A step by step appearance of the explanations can improve this course better rather than making all information available on the powerpoint in one page.Nice job!",4
64450,Pretty well presented. Debit 1 star for a mis-quote in a lecture (later corrected via e-mail). I'll do more from these guys.,4
64453,Good refreshing info,4
64455,Nice course to learns basics of internet.,4
64459,only show us what it is.,4
64462,Very great course with lots of information,4
64464,Good introductory course. No labs involved. No certificate issued.,4
64467,A good introductory course,4
64472,Good: i understand a lot of things.,4
64475,nice review in TCP/IP,4
64476,Interesting and simple explained,4
64479,Way too technical for a beginner...,4
64486,"Great course, I've learned a lot of networking, the course teaches the basic stuff of internet and it is a good way to start this. I recommend this course to anyone who has a little experience of this, I want to clarify some information like layers, for example.",4
64488,Good inntroduction to TCP/IP and IP V4 and V6.,4
64489,This course is awesome. It teaches from the ground and easy to understand all the contents.It helps to build up concept and is very helpful for further detail study in the same topic .,4
64490,Was very my informative and a good resource to brush-up my academic skills.,4
64491,"The teacher is awesome and I understood the concepts that I had never paid attention to in college! Thanks a lot for this course.Suggestion: Maybe a bit mode detailed explanation regarding the congestion control mechanism of TCP(CWR, ECN), and how it works in real life.",4
64493,"A great beginers course in the networking field, Youll learn what are the basics of network",4
64498,very clear and specific easy to understand,4
64500,Nice and clean information about TCP/UDP an IPv4/v6 protocols.,4
64503,"Highly theoretical presentation on attributes of TCP vs UDP packets, and also about IPv4 vs IPv6 packets,A little more on advantages/disadvantages of one over the other, some background history on why and how it was developed, response from device manufacturers, and some opinions on future adoption would be great value-added to the course.Thanks, Professor Chung.",4
64517,"Actually, I think that information is incredibly relevant, but I need more examples - as simplified as possible - in lectures",4
64521,"This was a very interesting course, though a little longer videos on applications of maths in data science would have been nice.",4
64529,Nice course. Thanks.,4
64530,"Math is rather boring, but programming is too fast sometimes. Also, it would be better to have more programming assinments.",4
64544,"Great class if you are looking for an overview of the 150-year span between the Enlightenment and World War I. What is unique (as far as classes I've taken) is that it makes mention of events in South America, the Middle East and Asia beyond how they affected the European or American powers.",4
64561,"This was great. For em, a person who's just in need of learning new things, this is great. Besides, there's no limit of certifications that you can have. But, I still don't think these videos cover everything covered in a professional university.",4
64571,Loved it !,4
64583,"It took a little while to get interested in the course, but by the end of first week it began to get interesting. I liked the professor and his friendly style. It is definitely an overview of the major events of history. One can always find out details about events that one wants to know more about. This course gives a broad idea about world history and in a way helps us see what the future would be like. Because history does repeat itself.",4
64589,"Interesting course, well presented with just the right amount of charts and graphics, a talk and chalk approach. Some of the diagrams could have been higher resolution to enable better understanding on a first run through",4
64590,"Good presentations. Enjoyed the lectures, good information, and good illustrations and maps. I'm grateful to have this opportunity to learn about this period. Phillip Zelikow takes you through the history through time zones, while visiting various ideas and happenings around different parts of the world, and how they are interconnected. I would like to see some reading material for further understanding (not just suggested books). Overall, I would recommen",4
64592,"Someone who doesn't know history is destined to repeat it. I'm not a fan of history, so why take this class? Because I believe in the first statement and wanted an overview of how we got to where we are. This is a great course for that.",4
64600,The course was very interesting and the professor explained really well in simple ways.,4
64610,Great overview showing the real movements and influences that spurn history!,4
64616,Overall good class--instructor is lively and engaging,4
64617,"Very interesting and intriguing, quizzes are a bit hard because they cover so much material so if you are a working individual I feel it's almost impossible to accomplish but it's nice for general knowledge.Two notes-First, it would be nice if the professor wouldn't use ""get yourself comfortable"" in the beginning of EACH video - it is a bit annoying.Second, on quizzes & tests it's recommended that you omit the sentence ""in the presentation"" that starts EVERY question/quizz/test because obviously it is based on what we are presented in the videos so it's just time consuming, in my opinion.Besides that, great for general knowledge, awesome teacher, I really enjoyed this course, thank you!",4
64624,"Another great course from a professor at UVA! Almost all of the lectures were engaging. He teaches history in an easily accessible way, using very good maps, diagrams, paintings, and clear illustrations of his topics. I would recommend this course everyone, but especially folks who find history to be a dry, dusty thing, as he breathes life into the material.",4
64627,A much much valuable course...,4
64629,Very interesting,4
64631,Excellent overview and an inspired teacher....BUT:1.A short bibliography for each week/session would be extremely helpful.2.Response and interactive involvement by the teacher in the discussions would be appreciated.3. Lecture notes and Illustrations in digital format would be wonderful as a reference for further work and non-native english speakers.ThanksRod Allwright,4
64632,"Very engaging professor, easily understood. The obvious editing was very distracting and made one wonder what was being deleted.",4
64652,nice course to understand the history from a different view!,4
64676,I liked the approach of the topic and the narration style. The focus on finding reasons behind historical moments is a good feature of this course.,4
64690,"It had a lot of information, however there wasn't a vary of sources.",4
64695,"Being a professor as well (though in computer science), I know how hard it is to get the full attention of the students. I congratulate Prof. Zelikow for his achievements. This course has capture my attention and I was eager to watch the next presentation. I learned a lot and I just have a single point (actually a suggestion), which is that each module should finish with a list of literature for those seeking more info on particular topics. Apart from this, a well balanced course. Not easy to put together stuff about 250 years of History.",4
64707,Would be great to have slides available to help for future review.,4
64710,This course was great because history has always fascinated me and this helped fuel my love of history.,4
64713,Excellent Oration packed with wonderful analysis. History has never been so much fun.,4
64720,"Content is 5 for sure. The fact that they keep suggesting to go for a verified course however is a little bit annoyig, so 1 star off for that. I think it would be more appropriate to give an option to disable future asking similar to how ratings on Android work. That being said, the course is excellent I'm taking this for pure fun and it really is, ... fun! :D",4
64729,"I think the course is interesting, but very general.The lecturer is very good and all presentations are clear.There is a lack of references and links to self-study.",4
64734,"Good lectures, although I prefer application based courses.",4
64757,I thought the active negotiations with other students were very effective...,4
64774,I enjoyed doing this course and hats off to Prof Barry. His lectures were very interesting and I have learned a lot from this course. The exercises were stimulating and don't look further if you want to become a good negotiator be it for salary or buying a property or just to negotiate with your children!,4
64781,Very well structured and gives very good tools,4
64801,Explained negotiation in an interesting and engaging manner. Easy to follow and it's quite addictive.,4
64804,Thank you!,4
64822,"This course in really insightful and with amazing content, but the structuring of the course is a bit confusing: too many divisions, and no clear learning path",4
64829,"Superb presentation of objective methods to approach negotiations, with exercises and",4
64849,very well organized and I esp like the way we have the case studies .,4
64863,This great and comprehensive with lots of real world example. I learnt alot from the course.,4
64865,"I loved the course it helped me to summarise and bring together all that knowledge I have got through my personal experience and listening to the course I often found myself thinking that I had it somewhere and somewhat experienced in past I am sorry I did not listen nor new of the course then I was younger, how many things could I have done differently",4
64872,"I have a master of science degree in consultation thus negotiation was a big part of the course therefore I have some background on the negotiation topic. I took this MOOC to polish up my skills and to see the value of negotiation training from a top university like Yale.The course was well designed and while I believe there is no one way of teaching negotiation, this course was more of quantitative way of doing negotiations thus the mathematics is a bit hard to follow. My degree course had no mathematics in it and thus this was an adjustment for me.I did like though that e had an opportunity to do live negotiations or the option of writing an essay and that the assignments had no deadlines thus making it a very flexible course.",4
64873,"Interesting course, useful principles and good animation lecture.",4
64888,"Extraordinary Course with an excited lecturing team behind it! Have done some courses here, but none of them had so much content and sophisticated teaching methods and cool guests. The only star that's missing is that the system for finding negotiation partners could be optimized. Overall, was worth the time!!!",4
64891,"Excellent course. It is probably less structured, than the University of Michigan course (by professor Siedel), but contains a few breakthrough insights that the Michigan course lacks - eg a more defined concept of a pie; a more structured approach to dividing this pie; the principle of ""never say no to a proposal, make the other side say no to your proposal instead"" etc.",4
64908,"Lots of detail, particularly about the Penn museum.Descriptive",4
64911,I wanted to give it 4.5 Stars. The course was wonderful and was well thought.,4
64914,Interesting course stimulated my desire to learn more about ancient Egypt,4
64918,"I liked it, but I've expected more videos. For example, on the cult of Aton, on daily life of ancient Egyptians and their art.",4
64923,"A good introduction to the history and culture of the ancient Egyptian people. If you are truly interested in the subject, further independent research is absolutely required to gain more than a perfunctory understanding of the topic.",4
64926,Very interesting material covered by the course. The Professor teaching it sounds a little dry.,4
64931,It needs more written notes so that it would be easier for a person follow up.,4
64934,"The course is a good general knowledge introduction to Egypt, there is lots of information stuffed into each week. The lecturer's style is super dry, but the lectures are ultimately very useful. This course style is sometimes a bit disconnected, in that the information you are given is often handled purely as information, and not quite as often contextualized. This tends to make the quizzes, and discussion prompts feel disjointed, and challenging in the way that it's difficult to use your newfound knowledge in application. That being said, I really enjoyed the class as a very direct knowledge-gathering experience.",4
64935,It was not quite easy to listen to professor Silverman in the lectures and remember the details later. But I very much appretiated the suggestions for further reading. All in all the course helped me to get further in my studies on Ancient Egypt.,4
64939,"Interesting class, which give a good overview of Ancient Egypt.",4
64945,"Fantastic content, I really learnt some new things",4
64953,The course was very enjoyable. I would like to see a video lesson the geography of Egypt as there is much mention of locations in the early lessons. There is nothing about temples or rituals or the Valley of the Kings. Perhaps this could be a 2-part course with more themes. Many of the url links I tried to look at do not work. That needs to be addressed.,4
64955,Very interesting course. I was looking forward to at least a week dedicated to studying ancient hieroglyphs but they were only mentioned in passing.,4
64957,"A very good basic introduction to Ancient Egypt. But, if you have already taken a similar course or read several books on the topic, you won't find anything new. The instructor knows his stuff but doesn't seem very passionate or engaging.",4
64983,"Nice and rather short course, giving a good introduction about Ancient Egypt.",4
64987,"Definitely recommend if you need a crash-course on Ancient Egypt! In-depth, concise, and well explained; suitable for all those interested in ancient history",4
64988,"I did learn a few new things, but I would have to say the course is very easy to pass. The hardest part is the essay questions, but these are optional. Anyone having basic knowledge of Egyptian history could pass all the quizzes without doing anything else. You only have to get 50% correct.The recorded lectures were good, but not great. The speaker is reading the transcript and it seems like for the first time. He is not speaking naturally and it's a bit stiff.Nevertheless, for someone just starting, the course has all the essential information needed and you will learn a lot.",4
64991,needs more data visiualizations.. images that used repeated many times which is confusinng.,4
64994,"The course was interesting and contained a lot of information. However, the quiz questions are not all answered in the lectures. Several times I had to go to outside sources to answer some questions. Please go through your quiz materials and make sure that the answers are presented clearly in the lectures. Or more easily, rewrite the quizzes to contain only lecture material.",4

I have difficulty in 8.1 .I have answered all correct answers.Somany times given only 4 correct answers. I am B.Sc, B.Ed with Maths. I have taught Maths in 10,11,12 th class. i will also join new course. Can you give certificate for Pre-Calculus? Any fees for that?Thanks.Jasubhai D.Desai",4
65009,"Best, but it could be little difficult for beginner",4
65012,"Support was pretty good but I spent a lot of time trying to fight through the thicket of version compatibilities. They introduce a lot of interdependent elements in one short class so that is definitely a feature. I would recommend learning Ruby elsewhere if you're completely new to it before starting this class. I paused to work through the very awesome ""Head First Ruby"" book and it gave me the skills to move on. What the course does well is show you how these many interdependent elements work together: Ruby, Rails, Sublime Text, homebrew, rbenv, rspec, httpparty, heroku. It's a lot to take in and you really have to explore each subtopic a little more on your own to make it work, but you finish with a pretty rich understanding of the ecosystem of tools and frameworks you need to be effective if you do. Definitely overall recommend, but know that you're going to have to do some work on your own.",4
65018,It is very much useful to the beginners who are thinking about their career in the software fields.Because this course is very much helpful to get an internships.,4
65019,"Nice Course, well structured.Only issue faced was with Grader not letting to use Rails 5, please be aware of this and use Rails 4.2.8 and save some time. :)",4
65026,Video captions were a poor substitute for lecture notes,4
65029,"the good: very well organized course materials. the extremely well thought-out approach to presenting the materials makes the course seem pretty easy. there is so much detail surrounding Rails -- the professors of this course do a commendable job of distilling the lecture material down to the truly most important elements.the bad: i struggled a lot with the automatic grader. i might have spent as much time wrangling and gaming the grader as i did on the assignments themselves. not sure who's at fault on this, but is sure was frustrating. (but i still highly recommend the course.)",4
65038,"Good. But as the course is rather short, knowledge is not covered in detail and may easily be forgotten without extra practice.",4
65043,"It was a really good course, although a bit 'dry' (lessons were similar to each other and thus tiring in longer perspective).",4
65056,"Very good introduction course, thanks!",4
65068,Very interesting!,4
65070,Good way to start with ruby and rails.,4
65077,"I did not know anything about Ruby or Rails before this course. I found this course quite challenging because there was so many new concepts covered in very rapid fashion: Ruby, Rails, Rspec, all other tools. However, I think the coverage of the unit testing concepts was really useful. I had to go for google quite many times to find out resolve issues I had with the tools and assignments. But in the end, I think this course was a good one, rating it 4 out of 5 starts.",4
65098,"Great course with very useful insights and techniques, which would have taken me way more time if I tried to learn and develop it by myself. Totally recommend it.",4
65105,Overall the course was good. The final assignment had some details missing and found myself struggling for some very trivial issues.,4
65108,Great Initiative,4
65109,"I still have some problems with understanding of Ruby lang, but Ruby on Rails is taught excellent! (anyway this course about rails). Good luck!",4
65127,"I think this course is good - before I took it I've never written any code in ruby and now I know some basics of it. I can say the same about Rails and unit testing. Everything is explained nicely, so it's really easy to understand.Even through it a good course, it has it's flaws. While we get to try different things, only the basics are covered - now I know those basics, but I'm not confident in my skills with those. I think there should be more exercises, assessments to develop those skills.",4
65129,Very good introduction to Rails! Well-organized and structured course! Totally worth it if you are a beginner or intermediate rubyist!,4
65131,Excellent introduction to Ruby on Rails.,4
65139,"An excellent introduction to the Ruby Language and the Ruby on Rails framework. Lectures are a bit fast-paced, so learners may need to seek reference from external resources.",4
65142,A very basic overview of Ruby on Rails and how to create APIs from a Rails Application in seconds.,4
65144,Good course for fresher !,4
65148,Great class,4
65150,"Good course, and the full stack specialization is an excelent idea.Thanks !",4
65187,"Great start to rails, provided a practical intro. Could have used a little more frequent practice actually writing code.",4
65196,"Why 4 and not 5?I had problems with the 2nd assignment, because the instructions (what was expected for me to return in the tests) weren't clear enough and if it wasn't for the forum, I'd still probably be stuck there. It might be that there was a ""good practices while coding"" was missing, ie. ""Why to declare something as nil while you assume it's going to be an array?"" or ""Why and when to initialize variables?""Apart from that the whole thing was very nice. I've learnt a lot. Big thumb up.",4
65197,"Great Course, Great assignments and pace. Loved it.",4
65202,"Solid introduction. I really liked the self-assessment checks of the coding assignments with rspec.It would have been a nice touch if the coding examples adhered to the Ruby style guides a little better (Rubocop, rails linter, etc).",4
65217,"Very good, the lectures are straightforward and the material is understandable and well-explained.",4
65232,great introduction to rails,4
65243,"I just completed module 1 and the coursework was good. I really wanted some more explanation and examples on how GITHUB works and working with remote repositories as some of the question on the quizzes were specifically asking for those. Apart from that , so far this course is awesome! Cheers to the team for putting forth this course .",4
65248,Course does not explain how to use RoR with mobile applications,4
65257,"I enjoyed my first foray into Ruby on Rails!! Coming from a JavaScript background, Ruby was certainly refreshing. However, to really learn Ruby, I can see that I will need to spend a lot more time studying on my own. This course was good enough to get my feet wet, though!",4
65263,"great course, awesome contents and grading!!",4
65264,The course was handled well. I would have given it 5 stars if the last exercise's test case didn't have a bug.,4
65270,This is a great introduction to ruby. Some of the assignments were tough to get your head around but once we really got into rails it was excellent,4
65279,pretty good and specific!,4
65280,Execellent class for Ruby beginner and can be applicable to any other language that use as CM like Chef or Puppet as a requirement.,4
65284,Very good course. Teachers are very reactive to answer questions.,4
65287,"It was pretty interesting, although it may be fast at times. I find it particular engaging and interesting. I would definitely continue with the next course.",4
65291,"Excellent explanations however, should be sure of do not make comparisons with other programmatic languages since it cause confusions",4
65299,Overall nice way to get introduced and familiarised with Ruby & Rails.,4
65301,Awesome! great lecture and great course......,4
65303,"Great introduccion course on Ruby on Rails, with some problems with the grader. Technical staff performing well, very good effort trying to figure out and solving the problems.",4
65308,The course is very practical and applies to the real world scenarios. Excellent.,4
65313,Several mistakes in the programming assignment.,4
65317,"Very nice course! However, I felt the the Ruby part of the course was a bit fast paced and short and a little more time should have been spent on it.",4
65329,Good information. I would request more activity based learning instead monotonous one-men presentation.,4
65337,It is very useful who are interested in Genomics and overall computational biology.,4
65342,"I'm fascinated by bioinformatics and genomics, which is why I took this course. I gave the course four stars instead of 5 because I think the flow of the lectures could have been better. When watching lectures, I often found myself jumping around in my notebook to write something down. Other than that, the course was an excellent introduction.",4
65345,good course,4
65353,Great introductory course!,4
65354,a great way to start.,4
65355,Its called an introduction to genomic technologies and that is basically what it is.,4
65356,Exceelent course for any beginners in Bioinformatics.,4
65358,"I appreciated how the instructors presented the content in a fluid and limpid manner, with relevant examples and auxillary knowledge that you couldn't find in a textbook. The assignments provided the opportunity to apply the learned content to analyse and parse statistical data from actual journals.The new and up-to-date knowledge I gained by taking this course made me more confident to apply to graduate school.Thank You",4
65360,"The entire course took me about 8 hours to complete. The videos are on average around 10 minutes long. The first two weeks of the course were very introductory and had they stayed that way I would have been disappointed (however they were focused on my specialization). Week 3 and 4 made it worth it for me and were very helpful (computing technology and statistics). I thought the course project could have been better. I didn't feel it was a strong overview of what I learned about the course. Either way, I'm glad I went through the entire thing.",4
65362,"Informative. Nice, low commitment class to provide some background to genomic technologies.",4
65366,"The course is a good introduction into genomic data science, I disliked last week because teacher gave too many unnecessary information. But overall it is great course for Computer Scientists especially.",4
65370,Good intro for a non-biology person like myself,4
65379,"The final project was way more work than any of the other weeks (10 hours!), but it was definitely worth stumbling my way around Galaxy and foreign genomic terms for that long.",4
65380,"Good introduction to genomic technologies, could cover more information... but it is an introduction.",4
65382,"This course is great for people like me, who know almost nothing about the topic, lectures are good, points are clear, understandable and not too long. Only thing I actually didn't like is amount of lectures. The course is planned to be completed in 4 weeks and for me it was over in few days. I would like to add that I've listened the lectures from work and spent 1-2 hours a day on it. All in all, I'm glad that I've started from here and plan to continue with the rest of the specialization.",4
65383,Good Introduction!!!,4
65385,"Very good intro course. Information is presented clearly and concisely, and it was pretty easy to comprehend even with no background. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the quizzes were a bit too easy and I don't think touch on all the important details.",4
65386,good course.,4
65391,A great introductory course in genomic data science. Enjoyed it!,4
65392,The last module and the final paper was a little confuse for whom is not from Biology (I'm from computer science). But the course is very well made and gave me the notion I'd like to have. The professores are very well qualified and inspired me about the subject.,4
65395,"Good overview of the knowledge domain. Perhaps it could be extended with some advanced, optional reference material for those keeners who would like to explore in more detail some of the topics presented upon....",4
65399,"A good introduction to the topics and concepts in the field of genomic data science in general as well as the other courses in this specialisation.I did this course close to the last (6th) being a professional in the Bioscience field for some time and so the first three 'weeks' I pretty much did in a couple of hours with close to full marks (not a boast but a statement: this course will give you the overview I accumulated in the real world; there is nothing esoteric or missing from this course).The final assessment I found a little quirky compared to the other courses I'd done being a comprehension style 'read a research paper + answer questions' rather than a 'enter the number of X given conditions Y applied to dataset Z' as many of the other course use. Still, celebrate diversity and all that...also I can't think of a better assessment for this entry level / background course.",4
65401,A good basic introduction. Might have been nice to have had recommendations for further reading for those who were interested.,4
65404,"Though the content is introductory and general concepts, it could have been done in a slower pace and a little bit more detail.",4
65406,It's very easy to understand for the researchers who don't have much knowledge of BIo,4
65409,nice! Stats review particularly,4
65412,"This course is an amazing. What students have to do to excel in this course is, they have to study from authentic additional material.",4
65416,Great introductory overview. I particularly enjoyed the summary of the human genome project.,4
65417,Very basic introduction to genomics including both biology knowledge as well as computer science application in genomics.,4
65418,it is very good but needs some more explanation and supportive materials other than videos to get more knowledge,4
65419,"Interesting topic, maybe an improvement could be to provide the material as one file and not many files one for each video (also easier to consult in the future).",4
65423,Comprehensive cover of the basics.,4
65433,Very informative ! Could use a section with a little bit more figures analysis !,4
65441,That was a great experience to join this course. I work in the luxury retail and it helps me to have a clear vision of the current and future challenges in this business. I would like to go deeper in each subjects in applying later to a luxury and fashion management MBA.,4
65447,"The course was interesting and good. The instructors were engaged. It just missed something. Maybe it could be sort of ""fresher"".",4
65467,"Incredibly well structured course. It covers very interesting topics, which are essential for a career in Fashion and Luxury. The interactive lessons are very effective and there are great guest speakers. The only downside is that certain stats should be updated with more recent figures. Overall, great course!",4
65470,"I think it was a very good course. Perhaps the speakers were talking a bit fast (and with the Italian accent it was a bit hard to understand). But except this very minor thing, I recommend it !!",4
65473,It's a very insightful and informative course which explains in detail the working of International Fashion Brands and Luxury companies.,4
65477,very informative course!! Coursera should have more fashion related courses,4
65486,"good lessons + good teachers + good contents, not enough interaction though",4
65502,very interesting and inspiring; the assignment is good but could test our knowledge deeper.,4
65506,"Thank you for a great course! This information is so valuable! But I would like to see the final test more distinctive, the questions are in some terms very vague.But all in all, I had a great time, thank you!",4
65508,"very clear for this industry. Sometimes the accent of the teacher makes me confused for the words. But after several class, i am familiar with it and know what the teacher talking about are.",4
65520,Great entry level course for anyone wanting to learn about how fashion and luxury companies operate.,4
65523,great course on Fashion and Luxury that helping putting the right words on thr tight concepts and clarify Business Models,4
65524,I found this course really interesting and i got a lot of information that i will use in my daily work!,4
65528,"Excellent contents, but relator's english is pretty bad. :-)",4
65529,"The course goes direct to the point, it's very objective. The only disadvantage is the Italian accent of the professors, sometimes it's boring to listen. I reccomend this course to students or for people outside the fashion world.",4
65531,Great to learn the basis of the fashion world! I knew nothing and now I know something! Worth the small price to get the certificate!,4
65538,"Excellent course, but the english of the professors can improve...",4
65548,"this course was amazing, i learn more about the retail process, how different brands manage own merchandise and line process, very recommend for learn retail management.",4
65560,The content is very organize and clear. I have gone through 3 weeks and it is a great introduction to the world of luxury.,4
65565,Both teachers are so passionate about what they are talking that is always a pleasure watching the videos and learning a lot about Fashion and Luxury!,4
65568,"I have always been interested in the fashion industry and found this subject not only informative, but also fascinating to go through. I enjoyed this immensely. Some information I knew, but there was a lot that also opened my eyes.My only negative was the clarity of the speakers English at times which made me have to either listen to the video again or use sub titles, otherwise I would give 5 stars. Other than that, a very informative and interesting course. Well put together and structured. Thank you.",4
65580,Thanks for giving me knowledge about Fashion. This is very helpful. :),4
65585,Would have liked some more examples for the explanation.,4
65586,"The quality of the content is very good. However, the content should be more detailed. Further, certain key subject-areas are missing such as the fashion calendar, quality control, merchandising, cool-hunting and forecasting, market research, event management, public relations management, retail operations in more detail, logistics, store operations etc. Overall, however, the course is a good overview about managing fashion and luxury companies. Moreover, interviews with CEOs and brand directors would make the course more interesting.",4
65587,Excellent teaching and material,4
65588,Amazing course!,4
65589,Very interesting to find out about luxury brands.,4
65596,"Wide-ranging and inclusive coverage of a vastly complex topic by an impressive list of erudite instructors. Very interesting, with very many jump-off points for further study. However... many of the translations into English were difficult to decipher, some to the point of near-obscurity. Sorry to say, translating of words does not reliably lead to transfer of meaning. Still, highly recommended for its reach in surveying the high points of the subject matter. Thank you!",4
65601,This course is very interesting and educational. I really enjoyed it. My only complaint is that sometimes there wasnt any translation from spanish.,4
65617,"Very good course, teacher is great and content is very insightful.On the less good side, students should not expect all concepts to be clarified from the beginning, so a good deal of research has to be self made.",4
65627,I can get the useful knowledge on origin of Fed and other basic source about American finace.So I want to deeply recommend this course to all of you. Thanks,4
65675,"This is a a really good intro course. As a short introduction to lots of different models, you come away with a full appreciation of how the reduction of the complex into simple models can advance your thinking, help better understand why people make the choices they do and make sense of situations that otherwise would be obscure. The only reason this is not a five-star rating is because there are a few points in the class where there is a break in the logic (i.e. a missing piece) and there are slides and text below the video that contain typos or mistakes. Individually, none of these are a big deal, but collectively, they take the professionalism down a notch.",4
65680,Good overview course.,4
65681,Great introduction.,4
65687,"The teacher is witty. It's a great course, but more mathematical calculating would be better.",4
65692,I think everyone should take this course although some of the lectures are hard,4
65707,I think it is terrific course - it is just right for me,4
65718,Gives perspective to the decisions people take,4
65720,I found this course very educational and i feel brighter after finishing.Modelthinking helps me to interpret the world and my surroundings.,4
65732,"The course focus is broad and instructor is great. However, some particular models have been described too general, e.g. the lectures on Lyapunov functions had no connection to the ODEs and other mathematical phenomena.",4
65736,One of the greatest courses on MOOC! The only thing which is still hard to handle with is the temp of speech of the tutor. :),4
65743,Love it! This is my first foray into model thinking. I wish there is a better way to say thanks to Professor Page.,4
65745,Contributed to making me a clearer thinker and was a good refreshment of material from my MSc Business Administration.,4
65749,Very interesting course. It isn't a hard course whatsoever but the concepts you learn are very fundamental and can be applied in so many domains. Very important to be a well rounded thinker.,4
65754,A must do course for everyone.. It's a rejoinder to all those who say that what you learn in schools/colleges is of no use in practical life.,4
65756,"This course is both very instructive and fun. The professor covers a lot of interesting topics. It would be better if he speaks a little bit slower, so the non native English speakers like me can understand all he is saying.",4
65760,"Contents of the course are very diverse, clearly changes your way and ability to identify patterns, and fit real world in to models to extract additional information ...It does not have a very in depth, description about most models, but enough to understand them, because there are so many different concepts that are fit together ...Its an excellent introductory course to models.",4
65773,Great course to built basic skills.,4
65776,I wasn't planning to follow the whole course and doing assessment and homework. It end up being a good learning and I watched most of the videos. I skipped known information and skimmed to relatively familiar ones / or when there was too much examples. I understand the course was built for common denominator student. Thanks for making this free course. It's much appreciated. - Michel,4
65777,Demanding but very enlightening course,4
65782,the lecturer need to develop his way of communications with students,4
65788,Gives the nuances of writing and also presents the logic of academic writing.,4
65799,Lots of essential information for budding researchers.,4
65809,Course relevancy was excellent to HR Operations. Would have liked additional explanation and detail on assignments. More examples ans cases.Some of the lecture were difficult to understand presenter. Some of the quiz answers did not correspond to course materials or ambiguous.,4
65819,Informative and illustrated how some quant concepts are put in practical use. Thank you.,4
65826,"This is an well done, interesting class with a lot of good information, but the course seems much too biased toward active portfolios and management. The videos from UBS add nothing to the class and seem more like advertisements for UBS than class material. That being said, I highly recommend this class and Specialization as a whole.",4
65832,I am grateful for take it thanks,4
65833,3 and a half stars... interesting topic and well presented. A few opportunities to demonstrate learning,4
65840,"This class struggles from translation issues, and order issues, for instance having to watch bonus material before knowing the answers on some of the quizzes. However, it is an incredible class, informative, and provides a very, very interesting point of view on the Middle-Ages, which in all my learning has always been Anglo-English-centric. It's an excellent class despite everything.",4
65844,"This course gives general information on the magic of middle ages. However, I wish the course could be arranged in a more logical and coherent way, such as geographical or chronological, which will help to understand and memorize. Material in Week 4 is very confusing. It is hard to get the key points from those materials and what the instructors want to tell me. On the other hand, materials in Week 2 is easy to be understood and reflected in the first written assignment.",4
65855,The course gives a good historical view on magic and how it was perceived without being biased in terms of the practice of magic itself. Rather it looks at how the practices were perceived and the factors that influenced the development and dimise of magic and related practices.,4
65857,"Not being an historian on the Middle Ages, Magic in the Middle Ages seems like an accurate and well planned course. Week-4 and week-5 were the most interesting, with week-5 delving into the knitted relationship of magic in Islam, with roots and lineages directly connected to contemporary practices of ""magic"" (which is something I did not know and was very curious about regarding the context of political and religious tensions evolving throughout the middle east). I would have liked more activity-based and practical instructional units on how magic and rituals were conducted, especially information on healing, medicines, and alchemy. Geomancy was the only practical component with explicit details on how to cast figures, and it needed to incorporate how it was used with astrology in a practical way. A unit on Astrology and the Astrolabe was needed as well since the videos and literature often referred to astrology, and without a basic working and understanding of how an astrolabe was used to calculate a chart, the student is left hanging on having to figure way too much on their own (which becomes rife with problems and miscommunication). The quizzes and assignments are fun but often awkwardly worded which became confusing, and can easily be cheated on. Grading of assignments was a bit nebulous and put into question others abilities to accurately and fairly grade. People paying money for course content should be separated from students not paying because engaging, stimulating, and critical analysis as discourse cannot be maintained in fidelity. Of course, the credibility of ALL courses on Coursera are at stake because little to no universities and businesses accept the certificates as valid credentials for jobs or career ladder mobility. Ultimately, one is paying for a piece of paper that is not really valued or even usable at the very same institutes that put together the coursework; and that is a very lame proposition! The final kicker is that I needed to submit highly sensitive, personal identification just to get a PDF of the certificate--absolutely ridiculous, especially considering that the topic of interest for this course neither necessitates nor warrants such high-end secure methods.",4
65858,"It was an interesting course and I enjoyed it, though I was hoping for less information about the church.",4
65863,The lessons i have learned through the course have taught me to new perspective to the time period. Great study.Thank you,4
65873,"Clear, fast and a perfect introduction for those who are interested in the subject.",4
65876,"it's a good course but i think it would be better if they have it also in spanish and apart from that as a suggestion, teachers should talk a little slow, sometimes it's hard to understand some words because of it. apart from that it's a very good course",4
65879,Good course but more room for improvement,4
65881,"I really enjoyed learning about magic in the middle ages and am grateful for the opportunity offered by the University of Barcelona. The lectures were clearly spoken and the content was good.However, I would have liked to go more into detail about the practices of magic, I missed that a little bit. For example, the specifics of several charms/ingredients/etc are only treated on a few occasions.I have now also enrolled in different courses on Coursera and I can say that this course could have been organised better, with better assignments, quizzes, etc. So there is still room for improvement.",4
65885,Interesting facts about the thoughts and ideas about magic in the medieval period and how it influenced the society in that time and even still influenced people of the 21st century.,4
65888,First and foremost thank you for providing us with all that material which is of high quality! The only improvement I can think of is a better sound quality and also having a person of your institution to review peers' assignment (or something of similar logic in order to improve the evaluation process of the assignments). Thank you for your time and may you continue your wonderful work!,4
65893,"The only reason this course did not get top marks is because very often the audio and the video did not match. Even with captions turned on it was, at times, difficult to follow as the captions follow the audio and end when the video ends even if the audio is not quite finished.Other than that I found this course enjoyable as well as educational.",4
65902,Movies were very interesting and planning to watch all of them with new perspective.Wish the summaries and important texts in the lecture was available as slides helping for quick review and recall.The same constant tone of voice made it difficult to keep awake and focus on the contentWished for more reading material each week rather than same book link.,4
65905,"I really enjoyed the course and in particular, the professor teaching it. I would have liked to spend more time in assimilating the information and to have some in video quizzes to help clarify and solidify the course content. One gets out of it what they put into it. For those who do not have a lot of time to spend on peer reviewed submissions, this was an excellent option. I am going to review all of the lectures again because I think it is important to retain new information and my 'working' memory is currently impaired. That said, I did not engage in the discussions and will have to do so after the fact. I absolutely loved the use of movies as a vehicle to learn about the course content and to better understand the differences in mild cognitive deficits versus the various stages of dementia. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and would gladly build on what I have taken away from it",4
65912,"I wonderful foundation course with the splendid added filmography. Great combination that explains false myths behind memory lapses, episodes of forgetfulness and concussion.",4
65914,"The Instructor is just magnificently brilliant! I love him , I loved the Course. I give four stars because it didn't meet my very inner expectation on very much stressing on how to overall extensively improve memory by giving many practical tips(though the topic was covered at some point).",4
65922,I liked the way that course go... it was nice to know how our memory work,4
65928,"Nice comparisons, presenter might have talk a bit louder",4
65933,"I think there is not enough scientific facts, I expected some more information about the molecular basis of Alzheimer disease and memory in general. However, I enjoyed the course and I would recommend it, it is very good explained and through the movies you can feel aproximately what these people feel.",4
65939,Interesting,4
65943,Enjoyed the content and examples through the movies,4
65948,Was very Interesting! I learned a lot!! Tks,4
65950,This course has improved my understanding of how human brain works.,4
65955,Enjoyed the course. Explained how memory works and memory loss occurs in simple terms.,4
65957,"I enjoyed Professor Seamon's lectures and I also enjoyed his book. While you do not need to purchase the book, it is well written and really helpful and interesting. Professor Seamon has an endearing and personal style which makes the material come to life. The movie selection was excellent and helped reinforce many of the technical definitions about memory. I feel the quizzes could have been a little more challenging. Overall a very enjoyable experience.",4
65962,Great movie selection.,4
65966,Very interesting and amuzing way of learning about something so important as memory is. I have enjoyed every lesson.,4
65967,"I thought it was an excellent class for discovering how our memory works. Thanks to the movie examples it provided great insights into our brains, and importantly the professor was there to explain the differences between fiction and actual scientific knowledge !",4
65971,Very interesting in an entertaining way,4
65973,"Liked the course, subject, content and faculty.",4
65975,Very interesting course. Easy to follow and well presented.,4
65982,"It's a very good course discovering the function of memory and how we maintain good memory, while principle and mechanism of memory's formation did not be revealed were the leaving regrets.",4
65984,"I haven't finished the course yet, so far so good!I would love to see more variety of films from other countries too.I'm convinced this course will evolve as further research on memorycontinues making the huge 'memory and aging' issue much more accesible.Thank you!",4
65994,Memory is an important topic to learn about.,4
65995,Great content and movies. Would have been even better if the professor spoke a little more loudly and perhaps there were guest experts.,4
65999,Interesting course. I liked that each session was short so I could fit them into breaks in my day. I also liked that the professor used movies to demonstrate concepts he was discussing.,4
66001,"I really enjoyed this class - it gave me some insight to how the mind works. The lectures were easy to understand, no full of jargon, and the quizzes helped clarify what I needed to focus on",4
66019,"Conversational format is really helpful, great real world examples and connections.",4
66046,Really informative and interesting. Thank you Coursera and Professor Sharpino for making this possible!,4
66056,Covers the basics. Quite Good.,4
66065,"Overall a good course. Although maybe a little bit short/quick on the Marxism side of it. There's more information about some of the theories of Marx (and how they are thought to be false), instead of the political side of it (stop exploitation).",4
66072,"""very inspiring, thoughts provocative course"", that I have learned a lot as a lay man in the morality of politics.",4
66077,"I'm glad I took this class; it was confusing and dense while being fascinating and thought-provoking. How's that for mixed feelings? It feels like a class I should take twice, the first time was prep and the second will be to learn the material and think through the ideas.",4
66083,"Really enjoyed this course, although it was like a whistle-stop tour of political philosophy. That is probably the one thing I would change about it - the title. Foundations of Modern Political Philosophy might be more appropriate as morality was only briefly touched on. But it was jam=packed with information and education, really good, Professor Shapiro was excellent, and whilst the students were a little infuriating at times, I guess that adds to it too. Thank you.",4
66085,It help me to understand about political situation and analysis.,4
66097,"Very interesting! I just didn't like the conversation format of it, but the professor is great. Thank you!",4
66127,"It is an excellent course. Amazing teacher who explained complex things using appropriate example. It is worth to have more course from this teacher. Somewhere I felt contents presented in manner that it place some premium to the ideological preference of west in general and US in particular. Echiman Problem was interesting example that teacher employed through out the course. But it could have been offered a balanced view, if teacher used ""whiteman"" problem i.e. exporting and imposing democracy across the world justifying all kind of violenceManoj Joseph, India",4
66135,"This is a great course to start. Although I am an Engineer by profession, i grew up following different political systems all over the world. I always amazed by the contradictory views of them. Finally, this course helped me to get a sense of different political theories and raised my interest much more. Thanks!",4
66138,"Its a good course for any one who wants to go into politics, business or religion. Only thing i did not like was there was not too much teacher student interaction.",4
66144,"I found this course fascinating. It explained a lot of history and politics that never quite made sense without an explanation of the Enlightenment in particular.My only comment is that it is very dense compared to other Corsera courses I have done. I think it could have easily been divided into more than one course as there was so much in it. I know that Ian said that there were other topics for which he could have run a whole course, however I think it could have been sufficient for me to have done the whole course on the enlightenment and then another on other topics.Thank you Ian",4
66145,Very clear,4
66159,very interesting course; the subject treated here seems to have wide applications in geometry and number theory; the weekly assignments were challenging at times but very thought provoking and I very much enjoyed myself during the course despite some minor flaws,4
66166,interesting and with a good balance between theory and practice. A bibliography at the end of the course could be useful,4
66167,"This course has been beneficial so far and I love the videos. The instructors are able to get their point across using layman terms, which is helpful.",4
66169,"A very interesting, well- structured, sistematic and didactic course.",4
66170,a comprehensive course to go through and grab a picture about precision medicine,4
66177,Very informative.,4
66182,"It was a great learning experience. Would love to do more such courses, if with any specialization in oncology field.",4
66185,"Great course, very clear",4
66189,Very informative and enlightening. Learnt quite a lot.,4
66192,"Excellent presentation on investment strategies and portfolio analysis, Thanks you! Noted a few issues with the quiz and spreadsheet presented which had some errors.",4
66200,I didn't have any previous experience on Motivation / Teamwork / Leadership concepts and i found this course very interesting and easy to understand.I hope this will help me in the future to improve my team working better.Thank you very much.Stefania,4
66206,As said it empowers you to be a metaliterate learner! :),4
66221,"Awesome content. Really inspired me to bring out my love for biology, chemistry and nature. The downside is that in order to fully absorb the content, its necessary to take notes while watching the lectures. This added effort turns what says is a 20 minute lesson into an hour at the very least. Besides the time consuming nature of this course, it was awesome. I love the awareness that it brings to people from all disciplines about the potential harms that we are creating for our environment.",4
66263,Leave out the politics and controversial science stated as irrefutable fact.,4
66267,Really interesting course and well done. Was really impressed with all the ressources and even guest speakers.,4
66268,"Fantastic course! Audio needs some re-mastering, was frustrating at times.",4
66280,"This was a great course. I am retired so I do not want extremely high level courses with quizzes that are very hard to pass. I feel this course was respectful of learners intelligence without going over the top. Well presented topics made it enjoyable. Also liked the interactive map learning, and tech tips. Thank you.",4
66282,"The course did an excellent job of providing a broad overview of mountains, from many interesting and important perspectives. So it was completely successful in its primary goal as a 101 course. I also really enjoyed the map section. It was a good decision to bring in different experts to add variety to the videos.Some constructive feedback:The quiz questions need some polish, in particular, the ""select all that apply"" questions. Also, because Coursera randomizes the order of answers, some choices like ""all of the above"" simply do not work.The course notes could easily be improved with some nicer formatting. They also do not always cover every question on the quiz, which would be nice for students who want to revisit parts they got wrong or didn't feel solid on.I believe that the tech tips will only be useful for a very small number of viewers. The idea of a quick tip on a related topic to the week's lesson probably sounded great, but the end result was far too superficial to be of any use. For example, instead of listing various navigation equipment and telling viewers to practice before heading out, it would have been more helpful to just pick one and give pointers on how to use it correctly.The sections of video where David is talking with an expert are very awkward. I know it's surprisingly hard to pull off, but those scenes really should have been rewritten when it was clear how wooden the interaction was. The question and answers are very unnatural, and the slow walking toward the camera is so clearly contrived as to be distracting. At the very least, fade the scene in with them already walking, rather than have a beat with them just standing still before starting their next take.That last point isn't a big deal, of course. Students didn't take the course to see great acting. And in general, the videos were good enough. But the production values can only slip so much before flaws begin calling attention to themselves and begin to distract from the material. Maybe one final point on the videos; Zac, was generally able to read the script more naturally, but David's earnestness endeared him to me more.As I said at the top, I think Mountains 101 largely succeeded at what it set out to do, and I am glad I took it. Some polish on a few areas would have improved my experience somewhat, but even as is, I would recommend this course to others. Thanks for doing it! I can only imagine how many hours on the script and in front of the greenscreen David and Zac must have spent.",4
66283,Highly recommand it to do it if you love Canada and its Mountains!,4
66291,At some point several instructors lost necessary passion to keep us focused. Otherwise it was a very informed and enjoyable presentation. Historical references are extremely important.,4
66319,The peer review assignment needs to improve the requirements.,4
66321,"A reasonable walkthrough of typical tools for photo editing. Only thing I'd like to add is a walkthrough of a simple typical photo editing workflow (like cropping, WB, coarse tone adjustment, tone curve, sharpening & consumption format rendering).",4
66323,useful and creative work,4
66324,"The best part of this course was an introduction to Adobe Lightroom. Although, I was left feeling as if there should have been one or two more weeks to this course- it seemed rushed.",4
66328,I would have liked more guidance on the actual use of Lightroom for enhancing pictures.. all the slide controls on the right were covered much too fast for me!,4
66336,This course helped me understand the post-production software Adobe Lightroom and various apps to be used on mobile. I got good understanding of what all can be done in post-production. In this expertise will come by experience. The week 3 was devoted mostly to understanding of post-production and took lot of time in going through. There was some mismatch between subtitles and audio in 1-2 presentations.,4
66349,"It's fine to charge for certificate, but submit the quiz is also locked if u try to learn for free, i do think that is a violation to the learning process.",4
66353,There were some troubles with the subtitles in the course. :(,4
66363,Excellent as per usual. Was just hoping for a little bit more detail on lightroom post-processing,4
66366,"Quizes are getting better with every course. Lectures are good. I like the idea of assignments - to show your work and to see works of others. Only one thing: I'd like to get review not only from other students, buy from at least one professional. It's nice to get opinion from ""masses"", but I'd like to know professional opinion and directions where I could move to be better photographer.",4
66367,informative. Yet it was tedious and repetitive I already learned this stuff in college.,4
66379,Very well explained and easy to follow.Learnt a lot from this course,4
66381,Good course. I learned a lot.,4
66382,"I know it's difficult to encourage student participation - in the 'discussions' for example - but a bonus of some kind for participation might do the trick. Not sure whether coursera software provides a means of measuring participation, but a count of 'substantial' comment postings might be a measure.By the same token, compulsory comments on the peer reviews would be helpful for feedback and also to indicate whether the peer reviews have been posted yet.",4
66393,An excellent to understand basics of Microeconomics.,4
66405,The program could use more detail in its instructions but I have to say my skills and experience was really put to the test. Just one issue with the specialization. The Protools requirement from the 4 courses is not a good idea. That DAW requires a Audio Interface which is the reason why some of my friends that don't want to take the specialization.,4
66437,I learned a lot about how to use my camera from the lectures. The only downside was the feedback which was very limited from other students. The only feedback from the instructors was at the end of the 5 course series and even it was limited.,4
66446,"The topics in this course are all useful for a Java developer. The learner should not only learn from the videos and the sample programs, but also the reference resources introduced by the teacher.",4
66461,"The interviews are excellent; this is a very thought-provoking class. However, all of the assignments are written, and there is one very week. Might not be the ideal workload for busy people, but the lectures are worth taking the course.",4
66462,very good course! doesn't go into too much depth but is an excellent starting point!,4
66463,Has some quite interesting ideas.,4
66478,Great course and great narrations. Too many dates & history to keep in mind in such a short duration haha! But great stuff! Very helpful to improve your music industry knowledge beyond what your circle thinks.,4
66496,Very good course!,4
66501,Easy to understand,4
66516,"Thank Mark Zupan, and team prepared for the course and interesting material.One star off for the complete lack of feedback in forums and cheating with text material. Neither of the books mentioned in the course, neither pdf nor links where to get or buy.Finally proceed to the third course where, hopefully, we will know how to calculate the required advertising and other tools to gain market power. Why study the specialization I mainly was started",4
66525,very nice introduction for artist mind,4
66532,"Nice information about Modern and contemporary art. General information, with good resources.",4
66533,"I have to admit, there is a whole vocabulary to describe and 'embellish' some rather ordinary and otherwise non-significant objects considered as Art.Please don't read this as a negative. I found the experience personally enriching. I also believe I will look at modern art with more openness and search for hidden messages. Still to be honest one sometimes has to feel taken advantaged of by some so called works. As they say not all that glitters is gold. But bravo for this MOOC offering!",4
66547,FUN AND INTERESTING COURSE BUT I FOUND THE INSTRUCTIONS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO UNDERSTAND AND THE ASSIGNMENTS BLOCKED BY COMPUTER DIFFICULTIES.,4
66568,"Ithink this course is unbelievably usefuland exciting but there weren't much information about educational method which was essentual,in my opinion. Thank you for your gripping course!!!",4
66577,"I thought this course was about art and related ideas. To my surprise is has a teaching focus which I did not anticipated and which has no interest for me. I did not do the final project because it does not interest me. Thank you for the art part, wish there would have been more of it.",4
66581,"This was a well structured course even though it wasn't exactly clear that it was about educators in the first place. The introductory videos on every week were very clever and on point. Loved the instructors and the whole team behind this course. However, the final assignment's grading is unacceptable. I cannot stress out how important it is to justify each score given, especially the lower ones. The final assignment did not have this, and as a consequence, when the final grade was in, low or high, you cannot know why, and fix your mistakes in the future. Some people were kind enough to leave comments on the comment section below, explaining everything, however, this should be the case for everyone's review. After all, it is a paid course.",4
66587,For teachers mostly but we do learn a lot about art and its major themes,4
66592,easy course but the lecturers do know what they are talking about,4
66601,While the course is interesting - I believe it can be more in depth and cover more art works,4
66613,It wasn't clear when I signed up that the course was focused on educators. i still enjoyed it.,4
66619,"I enjoyed the course itself very much, and I intend to use ideas gleaned from it in my English classroom; however, I was not satisfied with the rating of the final project. I put a LOT of work into it, including eight artworks AND eight corresponding works of literature that inspired the art, and someone ( a peer, not an instructor) kept giving me ""poor"" as a rating. Not that I expected that ALL would be 3's, but a 1 is not a fair grade.Just my two cents.",4
66621,"On the one hand it's interesting course with cool (!) visualisation. On the other - it's very simple themes to discuss and there is a usual way to understanding process in art and society.I hope you add new lectures about some directions in modern art, utility art and something like this",4
66639,IT's a course about how to teach ideas and modern art. Very interested. I recomend it to art lovers!,4
66643,Good information. Can be a bit longer. Completed too quickly. Can improve on the quizzes,4
66645,"As a total new beginner, this course is really great and interesting. I've learn a lot about modern art in general and work of art in particular.",4
66649,Good way to learn how to present an art work and express personal interpretation.,4
66651,"I enjoyed this course, but am still trying to catch up on the reading! :) I would have loved to see a few more weeks, with perhaps longer and more in-depth videos and more themes and examples. I",4
66653,"succinct but well targeted review and comments of several iconic works of art--paintings, photos, installations. The main value of the class is the classification viewpoint--not by art movement or school, but by theme. Not enough attention is given to art and identity and art and society (two of the themes), in the US. ""Originality"" or breaking into new concepts seems to rule, even when many of those works are rather vapid--such as, Duchamp's . Compare with the works by Lawrence, Picasso, Mondrian, D. Lang and others-SUBSTANCE.---Just my opinion, of course.",4
66661,I really enjoyed the course.I learned a lot of things about specific pieces of modern art with some of which I was familiar to and with others I wasn't.The only thing I would say this course lacks is the fact that there are not enough assignments to work on and so we can not use our imagination and knowledge to write something inspiring!,4
66673,"Great course! I did my undergrad at the Eastman School of Music, yet there is still so much more to learn. Although not as comprehensive or involved as a college course (I was never able to view peer graders' comments to my projects even though I did quite well on them), this course taught me that the possibilities as a musician are limitless with technology. The more I learn the less I feel I know. I am intensely curious about Music Technology now. Thank you Jason Freeman!",4
66675,"This was a fun and engaging course. My first on Coursera and was pleasantly surprised at the depth and quality of the instruction. My once criticism is that the course was obviously recorded a few years back and the section(s) on using the Reaper DAW require a little bit of adaptation to translate to the ""current"" version, but not a show-stopper.",4
66682,Interesting stuff and nice to have links and tools for creating your own music programmatically.,4
66683,"I like this course, the content and exercise",4
66689,"I wish the programming environment would be portable, so I did not invest my time in learning this in deep, I stay with my Max/Ableton. From the other point of view I liked this Course very much, it would be very interesting seeing more Links or Examples where I can deepen my interest.",4
66691,"Lots of good introductory info, well-paced and structured. Definitely a survey course, though it does have several very practical assignments and exercises.",4
66702,"Great lectures, poor challenges",4
66717,"A great course. I learned a new perspective about negotiation, now I'll continue to making my road. Thanks",4
66723,really well-explained introductory course for negotiations.I would have liked to see more reading materials and real cases explanaied apart to apply the concepts,4
66733,its good introductory course into the Supply Chain Planning world.,4
66735,It gives a lot of maths. But its quite interesting.,4
66741,"Nice statistics review, dust brushing from university times...",4
66745,it was another nice exercise,4
66757,Great conclusion to the courses in this Specialization. I would not recommend it for those already (very) familiar with Java but for those starting out with Java this Capstone is just difficult enough to be challenging yet not too easy.,4
66760,"The project is a little bit easy yet tedious, a good practice of using Java though.",4
66762,It's a great course. Students build a simple search engine step by step in the course.,4
66773,Good way to get to know how to present digital marketing ideas to clients in a coherent manner.,4
66776,"This course is informative, but some material is beginning to be out of date. I suggest refreshing it to match today's marketing landscape and challenges.",4
66784,"At times a little difficult to track with lecture materials as most of the learnings were not channeled in the quizzes. Overall though, lots learned!",4
66789,Lots of extra reading - sometimes reading took me 20 h per week,4
66790,"the cousre is wonderful and practical. However, would be more practical as soon as you provide a list of tool that are popular for marketer in digital planning either in a template form or in a case study.",4
66798,Nice course for digital marketing beginners! Very detailed explanation with case studies backing up. Good course!,4
66804,"I liked too much the way Rhiannon explained thw best practices to manage and create our measurement and marketing plans, and how to develop them in every digital asset we have available now.",4
66812,This course is immensely helpful for any one who wants to get into the area of Digital Marketing. The lecture series along with the recommended course material gives a very good insight into the vast world of Digital Marketing. I am happy I find this course and could complete successfully as well.,4
66813,Very interesting and useful.,4
66819,The overall quality of this course is good. Thank you.,4
66824,Good course to learn from.,4
66826,Overall very good. Perhaps a bit more in-depth at some of the subject but I off course understand that it was meant as more of a overview. Good book.,4
66828,I would like the course more dynamic and funner.,4
66830,informative and helped with our course learning,4
66836,Excellence in targeting the audience,4
66844,very helpful to have an introduction to this topic. Also good to learn from many studies contacted on the field and presented here,4
66845,"Really Insteresting lecture, but it is still hard to understand for people without psycology background.",4
66855,"Good course but it is quite long, it doesn't seem like an ""introduction"" at all. If you are interested you will need to invest a good amount of time but overall the course is worth it.",4
66862,"I found it to be a good starter course for the field, requiring no previous knowledge of the subject. Some of the matter, though, was overly repetitive, and the closed captions are very inaccurate.Overall, I recommend this course as a basic insight into the field, the material is interesting and well-structured and it was fun to learn about this one specific aspect of neuroscience in detail.",4
66866,"Interesting, broad introduction to the field. Most of the lectures are easy enough to follow as someone with a psychology background.",4
66867,"Thank you, very interesting. A bit difficult occasionally!",4
66871,This course leaned more on the theoretical side and less on the practical. Expect more neurologic research techniques and less real world applications. Which is OK. Very insightful. Tests could be a little more challenging. More interaction would be appreciate. An abrupt ending. Still a wide scope and easy to follow.,4
66874,Somewhat hard to follow at times.,4
66877,Excellent introduction to the subject.,4
66882,A bit fast paced but overall really good!,4
66884,Solid content and a great foundation of different schools of thought on the topic. Interesting brain science that is fairly accessible even from someone who doesn't know much about the topic. Some lessons can be difficult to follow.,4
66888,Provides a bird's eye view of the new growing field,4
66894,Challenging course for economists,4
66898,awesome course!!,4
66906,"Very good course, very bad accent:) even being Russian I could hardly understand sometimes",4
66912,Great course!!!!,4
66923,This was a good introductory course that I enjoyed and found elatively easy to follow,4
66935,Clearly presented and well organized material.,4
66938,Great speaker. Knowledgable and has a good way of presenting his information. I suggest that he adds objectives to every week's material as it can be confusing at times what we are exactly expected to learn.,4
66949,"Very interesting, and a well-paced overview. The course could be improved slightly by having another person even more fluent in English copy edit the quizzes. The wording is sometimes confusing and there are numerous typos.",4
66954,"Perhaps, better MOOC on smart cities among available ones. Covered different perspectives such as social, political, technical, legal, and so on. I liked the course, and will recommend it to friends and colleagues. Personally, I think 'S4-1 Transition in Socio-Technical systems' is very good articulation of challenges from a theoretical point of view. Great job.",4
66957,"Was clearly structured, contained great content, and constantly highlighted the key takeaways regarding the infrastructure of Smart Cities.",4
66960,Very nice introduction to the concepts of Smartcities. A small step in the future of our administrations.,4
66964,"Pretty informative course. I found some difficulties understanding some of the terms provided in this MOOC; thus, I think having more illustrated presentation would make it easier to follow along. Great efforts and a huge amount of ideas. Thank you so much.",4
66966,Very intesrting and well-developed,4
66985,Good introductory course - but assignments can be made more interesting with actual problems in scientific areas or basic algorithms instead of command knowledge testing.,4
66988,"This course is more like a lesson for data science, most of them are organized for plotting curve and making diagrams. This is good. But I was expected a more detailed lesson toward Julia itself.",4
66995,"Good and enthusiastic teachers. I found the difficulty a bit too easy but it was a good introductory course and I was new to Julia, so it served its purpose.",4
67002,"Information was very useful, but some of the content was difficult to understand due to the heavy accents.",4
67013,This class featured valuable interviews of industry professionals and provided an up-to-date and realistic view of many aspects of the popular music business in the USA today,4
67015,"Interesting. Good for beginners but some info is a little bit out of date. Overall, good course.",4
67017,Great Course !!!!!!! (:,4
67020,great course,4
67033,"Very up to date and challenging.Only drawback, not a lot of application and octave/matlab is good for a fast mathematical implementation but not for real application with python packages for example.Thanks Prof. Hinton for taking the time to make these insights publicly available!",4
67034,"This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning. I would have given it 5 stars, but towards the end, I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier. New concepts not thoroughly explained, sloppier slides, and even a lecture video missing at one point (had to find a link to it on youtube)! Still a very solid, instructive course, though. Recommended!",4
67036,"Nice course, though a little shallow.",4
67043,"An all round introduction to the field of neural networks, using a historical perspective, and looking deeply in to the theory. The lecturer is the godfather of neural networks, gives a good perspective of recent research by his group and others.The course has limited programming assignments (in matlab/octave), that don't really give you a good idea how to implement the ideas in the course. This is why 4 stars not 5.However, the phenomenal ideas presented, and the in depth theory, mean I am now bursting to teach myself how to build these systems, because they are so fascinating.",4
67045,"Really enlightening, fascinating material. Let down slightly by mistakes in quizzes.",4
67046,A little Difficult to understand,4
67053,"The content is theoretical, meanwhile, the application (code) is not enough to help understanding. The knowledge requirement actually is not to high. But the reading-presentation style make the class obscure. Now so easy to learn is you just follow the video. You may need to review previous chapters to try find the ""hidden details"" or google if you found you dont know what the professor are saying.",4
67055,Course presents an amazing set of topics form experience which spans over several decades. Professor is leading name in the field. I was extremely delighted with programming assignments which are very illustrative and well designed.Greatest minus to the course goes to lecturing approach which basically boils down to reading the slides. Additional literature in form of papers and publications are necessary to completely understand lectures.,4
67061,"Great course. I especially liked the quality of the assignments, that are challenging and force students to think over the courses. The only problem is that I would like to have 50% longer version that gives details on all the aspects.",4
67067,"This is a great course. Unlike Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student (e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability?). However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not. Thank you Professor Hinton.",4
67071,"A little bit hard to follow, but I endured to the end",4
67077,"Great content. Teaching style could be improved for the medium. A couple of errors that should be rectified. The course seems poorly maintained. It is pity because it is content really valuable and ""hot"".",4
67079,"Very good material and videos. However, quite a few mistakes in the quizzes and programming assignments (missing information, incorrect answers, etc) which requires a frustrating dig through the forums for errata mentioned by other users that was never incorporated into the actual tests.",4
67080,"Excellent course. Giving a broad introduction to different neural network approaches, while teaching a skill level allowing a comfortable start in using neural networks.",4
67082,"Covers a very broad range of topics, but each topics could be explained much more in-depth. Requires a lot of reading outside the course to complete. Could use much more than just four programming assignments.",4
67083,"Very helpful explanations if you already have some idea of what's going on. Can be a struggle if you come in with no context.I'd never heard of Hopfield Nets or Boltzmann Machines and I found it difficult to understand what was going on in the last few weeks. I think I was missing intuition and having many more concrete examples might have helped. On the other hand, for example, I already knew a few ideas behind convolution neural networks and the lectures cleared a lot up. The explanations are solid, though perhaps graze over some important things for ""newcomers."" The next step for me is probably to rewatch weeks 11-14 now that I'm no longer a ""newcomer"" on that topic...",4
67084,"This is a great course overall, even though it is a bit dated and a lot of more recent developments are not covered. There was also a mistake in one of the quizes, where they forget to mention that the values of the variables should be changed. Fortunately, someone realized that the new values were given in an old version of the quiz.",4
67088,"The field has developed quickly, the course covers many classical theories in the field. I suggest those read the deep learning book www.deeplearningbook.org for reference",4
67095,"The content presented in this course is really complete and well presented. It is definitively worth taking. Unfortunately, there were a few organization errors like missing video and quizzes errors. On a side note, it's great to be able to learn from Hinton since he has created many of the techniques presented in the course.",4
67099,"The prof seems knowledgable in the field, however the way the videos and slides are prepared is not my preference. I could not find much difference between the online class and the slides alone! There are also a couple of sections (e.g. Lecture 8a), for which the video is not uploaded. Overall I am very happy with this course but I think the presentation could be further improved.",4
67107,"Excellent lectures; Hinton conveys depth and theoretical clarity along with practical, down to earth advice on how to get useful things done without wasting time. Unfortunately the staff did a rather spotty job of updatating and maintaining the problem sets and I had to repeatedly find corrections from other students on the forums since apparently no one was fixing the problem sets in response to the forum discussions. Shameful since they are taking our money; it would only take someone a couple of hours to fix it up.",4
67110,"Overall, a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks. However, I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes. Some of the quiz items were ""off-syllabus"" too, although this encouraged further reading. I enjoyed the programming exercises, particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and would have liked more of them. For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng's course first.",4
67117,"The course looks like a part of something more detailed, complicated and wide. The most interesting part is dedicated to last algorithmic solutions for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and their connections to net.",4
67121,"The breadth of the content was good, but the depth, particularly with the recurrent networks from later weeks, was a bit lacking.There were a few quiz problems I spent a while on, only to check the discussion section and realize that the information/image provided was inaccurate.The coding assignments could be slightly more frequent.Overall, this was a good course. It seems like it would be difficult to give a thorough treatment of this topic by simply watching these lectures and taking the quizzes/programming assignments. I think this course is best used for introductions to various topics/authors, which can then be used as a stepping stone for more intricate, individual study on those topics.",4
67126,Best to follow,4
67136,"Very good and interesting introduction to neural networks. I particularly appreciated the history behind the different types of neural networks so that one understands where the basic ideas come from. I was however a bit disappointed in terms of mathematics, the course could have used a bit more mathematical formalism and some more hands on exercises. Still, I warmly recommend this course!",4
67138,"This is a great mathematical course to understand what's going on, but the assignments and quizzes are just repetitive and basically ""run these commands."" Professor Hinton definitely knows his stuff, and just sitting through his lectures was worth the time. That being said, Week 13 is busted as of 2017-1-22, Question 6 and 7 use variables values that are never mentioned. The only way I passed it was to google an old version of the course in Chinese that had a line saying ""please use these other variables""",4
67142,"The course is very interesting and detailed but maybe too technical in some parts.Also, some (not too sporadic) errors and missing pieces of information in the questions made quizzes even harder to pass. The discussions on the forum were of great help in this sense, though.",4
67150,"Overall I really loved this course, and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool. There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing (but still manageable) so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load. Not sure if it's a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device, so that has not affected my rating. For anyone considering this course, be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material.",4
67151,"Interesting course, good lecturer, but slides have too much text so it was a bit difficult to follow.",4
67153,"Good course, but is not so well interpreted. In some cases, I really donot understand what does the lecturer talks about.",4
67156,"The videos and the papers presented gave a full overview about the last 3 decades on neuro network research. The course has very tough concepts (RBM, Sigmoid Belief Networks, LSTM), but it can be followed if you have a solid background in math or computer science. The exercises in Octave were well designed to introduce concepts and to give a hands on about how to tune neuro networks. The unique point to improve this course is that there some mistakes in quizzes from 1 or 2 weeks related with missing images (wrong weights to calculate anwsers). The forum helped a lot, but it could be fixed to avoid more complaints. Apart from this minor issue, it is an excellent course from this exciting and promising field.",4
67159,"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neural networks and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures / quizzes to complete it. If you are not already familiar with the concepts and/or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustrating :-)One thing that definitively needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quizzes were corrupted (parts were missing). Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform. So look in the discussion forum if you find something strange in the quizzes.",4
67168,"Excellent material! Amazing to learn with one of the developers of NN.Unfortunately, there were lots of errors in the Quizzes and Assignments. Several questions could be answered only thanks to the help of other students that have had access to previous versions of the course.The mentors were at the beginning answering questions from the students that completed the course in the first couple of weeks and later disappeared. Then it was clearly in autopilot.Anyway, positive!It is necessary more hands on exercises to tight the theory with the practice.",4
67169,"A great course to learn.Some quiz are broken, check forums often for that.",4
67170,"Hinton is the reason we use neural nets today. He's advanced the theory and continues to explore new approaches. This is eye opening. He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice. This could be remedied with more hands on exercises (not necessarily coding, though coding is a fine way to test understanding.).",4
67172,"Sometimes it felt too fast paced, still I enjoyed it.",4
67173,Difficult but interesting course.,4
67174,I like this course because it not only explains the theory of neural computing but demonstrates neural networks ML with a lot of practical examples as well. It enlightened me in the applications of Machine Learning technologies.,4
67177,"The Professor is making a great effort to make us understand the fundamentals of neural networks. But there is scope to make some topics in lecture 2 and 3 simpler by including notes on additional reading that is a prerequisite on linear algebra, calculus, and 3-D geometry.",4
67179,"Course content:The material is very cool, a lot of topics are covered. As for me, sometimes it was hard to understand the material because there weren't enough visualization and animation. Would be good to visualize/animate content more, like in Andrew's Ng ML course (less text, more visualization).Organization:Some links were broken, some quizzes/assignments were without files/pictures, so it is bad.",4
67183,"It is complete and interesting overview of state of neural network today. I really enjoyed lectures and quizes. Unfortunately, there are a couple bugs in coursera quizzes that confused me. Yet, forum discussions helped pass the course.",4
67192,"Programming exercises could be made more clear. Also, prior to each lecture, it would be useful to mention what specific papers or back ground material should be read to follow the lectures easily.",4
67198,"In general, this course goes through some basic aspects of neural networks, which is suited for beginners. However, some parts of the course are not clearly explained, e.g. the sigmoid belief net, and there's some problems with the quizes.",4
67201,Very interesting material covered and in-depth views. Unfortunately a few technical issues in quizzes.,4
67214,"Informative. I spent way more time on the programming assignments than the posted estimate. There was an error in the text for Programming Assignment 4 that was really frustrating; but luckily, someone had found the correct way to do it and had posted it on the forum. The intuition explanations during the lectures were great. All-around great course.",4
67215,"It is easy to brute force answers, which means, that those, who know it don't consider its certificate seriously and this reduces the importance of the certificate",4
67221,"It is a great privilege to learn neural networks by Prof. Hinton, a giant in the field of neural networks, and I am grateful for that. This course is excellent as a broad introduction to neural networks. Prof. Hinton conveys a lot ofintuition and technical details, and for people like me, who has no experience in neural networks sometimes it is difficult to see the forest for the trees.",4
67222,"A nice introductory course, which could perhaps benefit of a quick update and refresh, to catch up with new development in the field.",4
67225,Great course with awesome theory. The quizzes are great and help to re-inforce the conceptsImprovement area is availabililty of exercises in R & Python and more programming assignments. Only 2 programming assignments are a shame,4
67228,This course is just great!,4
67230,"Should have a bigger practical component. Also, there are a lot of technical problems with the course.",4
67233,Great Course,4
67238,"Quizzes were buggy, but the lectures were good",4
67240,"I really like this course. Geoffrey Hinton is one of the very best researchers in Neural Networks in the world. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) for substandard implementation of its tests (misaligned questions and missing question content) and programming exercises (missing supporting documentation and code). I was able to get through this problems by googling it, but this was frustrating. Once this problems are sorted out, this course will be really enjoyable.",4
67254,Thank you for this great introductory to Mindfulness and Meditation! Time to take it off the cushion and into the world!,4
67259,A practical introduction to mindfulness.,4
67289,Completed a Course which truly speaking was about Demystifying Mindfulness. The Course is different from the other MOOCS in the sense that you have hands on practical sessions in the Meditation Labs of the Univrrsity.,4
67290,A great MOOC. A good blend of academic material - very well presented - and useful meditation praises.,4
67314,"Great course to start learning about consumer neuroscience, the drop-down is that the videos are extremely superficial while the readings (included inside the compendium) are highly technical and advanced",4
67315,"Sometimes, the lessons wanted to cover a lot of topics in a small frame of time, so it may be hard to follow up with everything without a background in general psychology. I absolutely loved the compendium of different scientific studies each week. Overall, it is a great approach as an introduction, but it may fall short if you want to go deeper. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend it",4
67321,"Great reading material and plenty of researches. Overall it is a very interesting topic, though its better if you have a medical preparation for this course.",4
67324,Great introductory content into the subject. Monitoring/moderation of the forums could be improved.,4
67326,"I wasn't a newbie on the topic but it was interesting to actually see how things work in the labs where the investigations take place.The course lacks of a module of specific strategies to implement in marketing, but overall it's a great course.",4
67328,"Although I still don't know how do I apply these into my work directly, I have to say it is a quite interesting class.",4
67330,This course provided me with wonderful insight into Consumer Neuorscience and Neuromarketing. It was incredibly interesting and well-driven. Thank you!,4
67333,"Very interesting subject, although there were some difficult topics!",4
67337,"What I loved in this course is its ability to combine, illustrates and discus to distinct fields into one course that is really interesting.",4
67350,A good introduction to a complex field. Well worth the time and effort.,4
67359,"As titled, this is just an introduction course to neuromarketing but very helpful to understand the potential of this new area. The course opens doors and with complementary courses on how works the brain and how to measure the brain signals, it will help a new generation of (neuro)managers to transform their business activities, as well as their personal knowledge of... themselves :-)",4
67360,"This course was too biologically technical, but I loved it. From a marketer's point of view, there was such amazing information on consumer behaviour.",4
67361,A ton of great information and resources.,4
67364,Really love the course. The teacher was really good and have a lot of knowledge in the area. And is quite easy to understands.,4
67380,Great and inspirational course!,4
67419,Overall the material helpful. The tests though did seem a bit flawed when needing to answer with a typed in one word answer. I typed in the appropriate answer and was told it was wrong but when the answers were given it was in fact correct. It was a bit like reading a good book.,4
67427,Exciting introductory course to the field of positive psychology from some of the most prominent figures within the area.,4
67431,"The course is well designed but it is hard to make notes. There is no summary words or point in every video. Anyway, recommend for everyone who is interested in positive psychology , this course is great!",4
67439,Only drawback is translation is a necessity for non Russian speakers. But even this is do - able with google translate. Download video transcripts and translate them. Crude but effective. The web pages can be translated directly.Very organized.,4
67440,"This is a great starter course for materials informatics. It covers a good amount of topics and uses a nice case study to reinforce digital representation of data, spatial correlations, principal component analysis, and regression. I really liked the examples of pyMKS. My only suggestions is it would have been nice to have more hands-ons use of pyMKS and sci-kit learn. This could have been accomplished through a course project or homeworks.",4
67443,"Great, fantastic information that made me see the importance of data sciences in materials science and engineering. My only request would be to potentially spend more time fleshing out PCA and the statistical tools around it; most of it went over my head without seeing a step-by-step application of it that showed the calculations. Maybe it could be optional so that those who are already strong in PCA can skip it.",4
67453,"Great course. The classes and teacher are very qualified. The only flaw that I found was the tests, specially the last one. Seems that the questions in Portuguese weren't translated correctly.",4
67455,"It's great, complete and totally usefull",4
67457,"Great teacher, great course. The Portuguese subtitles facilitate learning.",4
67478,"I followed all the videos, and I really appreciated the professor tone, slides and operations management curriculum.",4
67484,Explanation was clear,4
67485,Great Course.I am not giving 5 stars because we didn't get the assignment to actually implement LDA algorithm and Complete Hierarchical algorithm.May be I am little biased because 5th course is not yet available.Please make 5th course available.Topics that need to be covered in 5th course are very import for implementing all these algorithms at lower dimensions.,4
67487,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality/specificity and depth of the previous topics. So sad the Specialization collapsed at 4 courses instead of 6.,4
67488,This course was my first encounter with Machine Learning! The course gave me a good understanding of the different ML algorithms used in clustering and retrieval of data!,4
67490,"For me, this was the toughest of the first four courses in this specialization (now that the last two are cancelled, these are the only four courses in the specialization). I'm satisfied with what I gained in the process of completing these four courses. While I've forgotten most of the details, especially those in the earlier courses, I now have a clearer picture of the lay of the land and am reasonably confident that I can use some of these concepts in my work. I also recognize that learning of this kind is a life-long process. My plan next is to go through [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370], which, based on my reading of the first chapter, promises to be an excellent way to review and clarify the concepts taught in these courses.What I liked most about the courses in this specializations are: good use of visualization to explain challenging concepts and use of programming exercises to connect abstract discussions with real-world data. What I'd have liked to have more of is exercises that serve as building blocks -- these are short and simple exercises (can be programming or otherwise) that progressively build one's understanding of a concept before tackling real-world data problems. edX does a good job in this respect.My greatest difficulty was in keeping the matrix notations straight. I don't have any linear algebra background beyond some matrix mathematics at the high school level. That hasn't been much of a problem in the earlier three courses, but in this one I really started to feel the need to gain some fluency in linear algebra. [There's an excellent course on the subject at edX: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1%3AUTAustinX%2BUT.5.05x%2B1T2017/ and I'm currently working through it.]Regardless of what various machine learning course mention as prerequisites, I think students would benefit from first developing a strong foundation in programming (in this case Python), calculus, probability, and linear algebra. That doesn't mean one needs to know these subjects at an advanced level (of course, the more the better), but rather that the foundational concepts are absolutely clear. I'm hoping this course at Coursera would be helpful in this regard: https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/",4
67493,"Great course on machine learning, however, left us in middle of learning, Recommender System + Deep Learning Capstone is missing",4
67496,Should use pandas instead of Graph Lab Create,4
67497,Good and deep dive into ML!Absolutely disappointed that the course was delayed and the promise to take it through Course 5 and Capstone Project didn't come through.Not at all happy with that!!,4
67508,awesome clustering course,4
67513,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from ""Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling,"" for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week.",4
67531,"I found that Week 4, Assignment 2 was testing our knowledge in ways that are in opposition to the general ethos of the course.I mean that this course is about gaining insight, intuition and the practical tools for ML, where the smaller details like - knowing which numpy function gives you a random univariate normal distribution - are normally provided for us, so that we can focus on the aforementioned broader, more useful aspects of ML/Clustering.The assignment had good content on the whole but the parts which were chosen for ""write code here"" could certainly be improved.I hope this is useful feedback and that the assignment is reviewed so that it doesn't needlessly discourage people.",4
67538,"All the courses in this specialization are great, but compared to the other 3 i did until now, this one seemed a bit short on material. Especially week 1, and somewhat week 6 was without good material. Weeks 2, 3 and 4 were great. I got lost somewhere in week 5 on collapsed Gibbs sampling.Still: very much recommend this course, it provides a good introduction to Nearest Neighors, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures and LDA. Thx prof. Fox!!",4
67547,"Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them (e.g. Gibbs sampling). After this course, it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment. Still, about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you ... it tastes so good that you would like to have much more!",4
67551,"The assignments are excellent and help understand the algorithms and concepts taught in the course. There are some garbling in the subtitles/transcripts (including the quirky one that every time the lecturer says EM - the ""EM"" doesn't appear, and the following word is capitalized). As usual Graphlab Create / Sframes can't handle apply(). however mostly apply() appears in the part of the assignment that inputs files and turns them into data matrices and the explanations how to run the assignment with Scikit-Learn include pre-computed input files",4
67553,"Great course and awesome teaching by Prof. Emily Fox. Prof. Fox did a great job of teaching some of the really tough components (GMM, LDA, etc) in simple and lucid style (like always) and that made it easy to understand and comprehend those topics.The one thing that I felt had gone down compared to the previous 3 courses was that for some of the topics, the material felt too short and felt like it was cut down to fit within the 6 weeks course duration. I would have at least liked some extra reading material or references especially for GMMs, LDA, Gibbs Sampling, etc.",4
67559,"Good survey of the material, but assignments are superficial and don't test thorough understanding.",4
67564,"The last weeks, we went through the material a little bit too fast.",4
67571,"Like all the courses in this specialization so far, the material has been good. The reason for only 4 stars rather than 5 is the difficulty in getting questions answered in a timely manner. There don't seem to be any active mentors for this class.",4
67574,Great course like the others,4
67583,"Still a very good course.Week 4 was very tough. The general concept can be understood from a 10,000 feet altitude but the lesson and programming assignment need to be reviewed, maybe with a slower step by step example.As some other student mentioned, it was... ""brutal"".Other than that looking forward to the next course in the specialization!",4
67584,"The things I liked:-The professor seems very knowledgeable about all the subjects and she also can convey them in a very understandable way (kudos to her since talking to a camera is not easy)-The course was well organized and the deadlines were adjusted when a technical difficulty was found by several students-All the assignments are easy to follow and very detailed-The testing code provided for the programming assignments is a huge help to make sure we are solving it the right wayWhat can be improved:-Some of the concepts during weeks 4 and 5 seemed a bit rushed. Although the professor explained that some details were outside of the scope of this course, I felt that I needed a more thorough explanation in order to understand better-Some links to the documentation of libraries used in the programming assignments were lacking information on how to really use them, I wish we had some other link to worked examples tooIn general I can say this was another good course for this series. Making a course like this is not easy at all and I can see that they are putting a lot of effort to produce them. All of their hard work is really appreciated on my end.",4
67585,I did not understand LDA from the course materials.,4
67587,Very good course. Too long interval between modules make hard for non-Python developers. Easy to forget some of the Python structures.,4
67599,Very good course nice practical approach. I was kind of surprised that hierarchical clustering was kept at the end and discussed only marginally since it is a widely used approach.I liked the part about LDA but IMHO I would have liked more discussion about fundamental techniques rather than such an advanced method.Too focus on text data. Most of the application I worked on have limited textual data.,4
67600,"The specialization has a good quality on average. I started doing this course immediately after it went open. I had a feeling that the quality of the course went down (questions were often unclear and it took time to figure out what is expected as an answer). However, many problems were solved quite fast and teaching stuff is really helpful.I still would like to see more about MapReduce in-depth in this course. I did not have a feeling that it was covered sufficiently (only theory, no hands-on material). In general, hands-on material was great and useful.",4
67603,"Great course. Some week were tough others too easy, but general a very interesting course.",4
67613,"Teacher was organised and coherent, lectures was clearly planned. Students however didn't seem particularly engaged with wide variance in understanding.",4
67614,It was hard to learn from the materials that we have to buy. Please understand that not everyone who sign up for the course can afford to buy the books on amazon. Lack of those books are showing effects on the way we attempt the assignments. It would be great if download links or online study links are provided in the readings section for all the necessary books instead of only a few.,4
67616,Good and interesting course.,4
67617,This is a really nice course! I am fortunate to be part of it!,4
67623,"The material in this course was informative, augmented by interviews with professionals in the field, case studies, and a final project that required interviewing members of a real-life board. A minor inconvenience, not everything is contained within the Coursera app/page. There is a lot of reading material to hunt down and download.",4
67624,Excellent introduction of this programme. As Australian student and professional practitioner I really admire the contents and research behind this programme. Thank you.Regards,4
67627,"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 1st Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants' learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, that's why I'm not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. I'm referring to guest interview videos. That's mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as it's always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",4
67636,Very interesting!,4
67641,"A little more in-depth than a course for beginners, but still simple and easy to follow, with a lot of additional material provided.",4
67642,This course is very interesting because it brings important data and information about managment waste and recycling.,4
67649,It was a really very insightful course which gave me a quite a good knowledge and understanding about the area of solid waste management. I got to know the basics of solid waste management technologies which are practice in the world along with some case studies. The assignments along the sessions of the course were also very helpful in self evaluating our understanding and knowledge. I thank coursera for conducting this course and hope for some more courses in the area of environment and water.,4
67674,Thank you! I've learned a lot from this course. The flow of ideas from a topic to another was very smooth. The cost model was very helpful :),4
67685,good course,4
67688,The not so short introduction ... with pros and cons,4
67694,A really well designed course which touches many different aspects of solid waste management in developing countries. Starting from waste generation and collection of different kind of waste and then explaining different methods and technology used across the world in developing countries to treat and manage this waste.,4
67702,"Learned ""real world"" skills from this course.",4
67709,I suspended for a while due to reasons beyond my control; but the simplicity of the course instructors and the explicitness of the course content cannot be over emphasized.I hope to finish it without any more suspensions.,4
67710,i like this coarse,4
67712,"Perfect explanations, great for layman, very thankful for this course.",4
67714,A lot of further research on the topics taught can help you flourish far and wide with the foundations taught in this wonderfully structured societal good course.,4
67717,"This is a great course! I particularly liked the mix of general and specific information provided- the course provides a overview of the physical and governance aspects of municipal solid waste management (MSWM), and then goes on to focus on the treatment options for the bio-waste stream, which accounts for a large proportion of MSWM in development countries, and for which processing and treatment is still not well-developed or institutionalized.",4
67733,Really nice course for basic understanding of solid waste management techniques.,4
67740,I have learned a whole lot! Thank you!,4
67745,Excellent course. Great dynamic. Thanks for sharing it with us,4
67746,"This course includes Municipal Solid Waste Management in developing countries, and issues that we do experience in latin american countries. It has a good overall technical data on solid waste management.",4
67758,I really liked this course. I just wish there was more documentation on insect reproduction. Other than that really good!,4
67766,The course gives you a quite well structured insight into solid waste management. It's a great stimulus for working hard on this topic.,4
67769,Excellent content and the way of explaining things especially the course notes and case studies.,4
67771,Very interesting course and lecturers provide a wide range of skills and experiences.,4
67776,Very Useful and Awarness course .Before starting this course i thought waste management is a simple thing .But now i am able to understand the effects of its open dumping an treatment proces,4
67777,The course was extremely helpful. As a practitioner I will be able to apply my learning in my work with local and state governments and development organisations.,4
67778,The lectures were insightful and concise. A few topics were a bit too technical like the one on Thermo Chemical Conversion. May be more time could have been dedicated to governance issues and strategic planning for SWM.,4
67779,Is a very good course with different examples from different locations worldwide.,4
67781,"The course content is very relevant and useful. I would like to suggest to include overview of more MSW management options. e.g. Refuse Derived Fuel, etc.",4
67783,very good course,4
67792,Good analysis of MSW practices in developing countries,4
67797,"This Online Course is really one of the best , that I have done . The Course design is excellent & a lot of new thing about Solid Waste Management , that I have not known earlier. Would like to go for more courses in Renewable Energy & SWM Sector.",4
67807,"I think I am experiencing a challenge on the MOOC. After completing a course section , you I do not notice any colour change to green, even after repeating some of them. I have completed all of the course sections in week3.",4
67828,"This course was quite easy.The exercises are interesting, given with their full solution.I think your need Pr. Erickson's book to follow the course.Thanks to the University of Colorado Boulder.",4
67831,"Great information, nice pace, only complaint is Homework take a long time especially entering your answers, very picky and precise, enjoy the lectures!",4
67837,very well organised. Lessons were clear and homework were interesting.,4
67839,The course is GREAT!!! It would be amazing if we could receive more feedback but everything is awesome.,4
67842,It is exciting and meant for people who are interested to research much more about what is thought. May take some time for classmates to help you with any queries.,4
67853,This is really a great introduction to power electronics. The only thing I disliked was you need to type in your answers accurate up to 8 decimal digits.,4
67863,A very good basic course. Tough homeworks. Be prepared to put in some effort to crack this course. But it's worth the time you spend on it.,4
67864,not clear homework,4
67870,The course was good and the assignments were brainstorming. But if we would have the solution for the wrong answers it would be good. We will get to know the mistake.,4
67880,A fair amount of self-study is necessary to learn everything covered in-depth (especially if you haven't yet learned these as part of a formal course).,4
67881,I would like to receive feedback about my wrong answers after I approve the course. I really would like to know what were the correct answers.I think that this is really important because I can learn of my mistakes.,4
67882,The course materials and the topic of interest is fantastic. Dr. Erickson does a great job explaining the fundamentals of power switching technologies and the homework greatly tests a participants knowledge of the subject matter and forces the user to really digest the material. My only critique is I wish the homework solutions would be shared after the homework due dates so that one could learn from,4
67885,Excellent course for brushing the fundamentals. The assignments also shows how the fundamentals are related to the big scheme of things.,4
67888,Very patient and methodical step-by-step development of the subject matter. Excited to learn about using LTSpice from the class instructions.,4
67918,"The course is good, the Lecturer is great. I learned a lot in this course.",4
67930,"Well done in terms of mathematical rigor and explaining the basics. One critique that I have is that there isn't enough time spent on intuition around the circuits. For instance, how does the buck converter work from a more qualitative standpoint? Easy to look up online, I understand, but the professor is excellent and I would benefit from his perspective.",4
67935,Hard and very rewarding to complete.,4
67937,"Pretty solid course for an online format. Solid grader and I enjoy how you can input derived equations in the homeworks that makes it feel more brick and mortar class. This beats other class approaches I have used in other platforms that use peer grading. Very comprehensible introduction and a satisfying course. I wish the course work was a bit more challenging. I know this is difficult in an online format (1st offering?) but when I compare this homework to their actual class websites (for on-campus students), it is obvious this online format was given the ""easier"" problems to solve.",4
67941,Nice introductory Power electronic course.,4
67957,"I think some of the content was a bit repetitive, and the time estimates of how long it will take to complete a section was way off (often the reading and videos in one section would actually take 3 hours when the entire module was supposed to take 3). Other than that, useful and insightful content. I learned a lot and I appreciated the video/ reading combination with the examples provided from several industries.",4
67971,That's very good course for training and sharing the useful idea with the varied s,4
67978,"Upon the first few views of the subject material, presented in the form of dramatized episodes, I was skeptical if this course was worth its time. I was pleasantly surprised once we moved into motivation in the 21st century, and the course only improved from there (though the multiple long videos in the financial crisis module felt redundant). A meaningful course as long as you can engage yourself with the material rather than rely on their sub-par assignments and quizzes to engage you. I also, did not participate in any discussions, but perhaps if I had this course would have been rated 5 stars.",4
67986,All the lecture were thorough and good.,4
67996,Pretty good introductory course.,4
68004,"The material in this course is very interesting. I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms. I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry-level manner - it will take some hands-on practice with real datasets to build expertise, understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base. I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming. I completed the Python for Everybody specialization, but still struggled with the programming in this course.",4
68015,Pretty decent course for beginner to learn machine learning. A case study approach they used is great and interesting.,4
68017,"It would be the best staring point for people new to machine learning .The course was very clear and well organized .The assignments and quizzes have given me much deeper understanding of what is being told in the video lectures . The only thing which I felt could get better was using other libraries than graphlab ,libraries which companies use .",4
68020,"It is a great course. Congratulations! Everything is subject of improvement, though. Check again that the version of graphlab referred to in the videos is the one available to download.",4
68022,Good start course. It seems some information not covered so sometimes it is difficult to understand the content.,4
68026,"Good introduction to machine learning concepts and I'm looking forward to a deeper dive in later courses. Would have preferred the course use industry standard, open source tools, but GraphLabs/SFrames didn't cause an issue for me at all.",4
68028,"The Course was very neatly presented, although we used lots of predefined functions to work around Machine Learning Algorithms it was good to know about the concepts that was thought extremely well.",4
68037,Very good introductory course with an excellent mix of theoretical and hands-on content.,4
68038,"In general it is a good introductory course. The lectures are easy to understand and the learning materials, especially the notebooks, are very useful, but it is a pity to know that the last two courses of the specialization were closed. Most of the programming assignments are too easy(just copy-and-paste), which is another disadvantage.",4
68047,"Very good introduction to machine learning. Concepts are well presented and explained, i would have preferred to use a Open Source library in the assignments, but is not bad to know how to use Graphlab, a very powerful tool, for sure!",4
68049,"It has made a lot of fun, only what I didn't like, that in this course GraphLab is used. We do not use it in my company, so I would prefer to use Open Source Software packages and not one what has to be bought.",4
68063,"Really good overview and easy start into the machine learning community. Only point is, that they do not use the usual python packages for machine learning",4
68064,This course is very important for me and i really learned many things of machine learning concepts and its important study case.,4
68070,"It would be great if you could intersperse theory and practical sessions. Otherwise, a very useful course...",4
68071,The course is a very good introduction to the specialization. It'd have been better if the course used an open source tool instead of a proprietary product.,4
68074,"The lectures are substantive, although they tend to be too short in duration. The python application component is very applicable to work-related situations.",4
68076,"A great intro course to machine learning concepts, the only problem with me is the environment, its course dependent and don't feel like it can be widely applied in various fieldsi would love if tensorflow or sikitlearn was adopted through the courseGreat course though !",4
68077,"love the approach, although the total lack of support (on the forums) is a bit discouraging. also, there are some errors that make it hard to understand the last week's material, but other than that, it's ok.",4
68080,"I really enjoyed the overall materials and especially loved the way they split the course into two sections:Theory and Programming.However, i wish they were using more standard packages such as pandas, or skit-learn instead of graphlab. It was a good class to taste what is going on in the world of ML.",4
68083,"This was a great specialisation taught by great professors, but I'm very frustrated that the final segment on deep learning was never finished! Coursera needs to fill this gap since it is hugely important topic and isn't covered adequately in any other Coursera material right now.",4
68094,Was a good intro to different kinds of ML. Wish we had used SciKit-Learn.,4
68096,Good lecture and practices.,4
68100,"Good intro to ML, but would've enjoyed less of the ""Black Box"" approach in using Graphlab.",4
68101,Very good introduction to machine learning with good examples.Some questions in the quiz could be rephrased to avoid multiple possible interpretations.,4
68115,"its good, if new to ML",4
68118,"This course is very practical for starters in Machine Learning. The ML methods it teaches are very fundamental, with clear and intuitive explanations about how and why they work. This course is recommanded to those who want a hands-on learning experience and who are not statistics experts that do not care much about the mathematical proofs of the algorithms.",4
68127,"Its been a great experience attending the course, one stop for knowing the basics of ML. Looking eagerly to deep dive in the coming courses of this Specialization. Thank YOU !!",4
68146,"The course was very well taught and the exercises provide a realistic introduction into real-world problems. The only thing that is missing to get to a 5-star rating would be to use standard machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, which is free) instead of GraphLab Create, which requires a paid license to be used commercially.",4
68147,This course is very good.Thankyou for all the teachers.,4
68150,Very interesting course as the start of something that will get more and more interesting. I am happy that I got this specialization and not only the course.,4
68157,"In general, a nice ""into"" style course to show the capabilities of different ML solutions. However, trying to be so ""cool"", ""awesome"", and ""exciting"" slash back easily: the first thing I remember from this course is that annoying squeaking giraffe, and not the real content.... Nonetheless, If you need a practical introduction to ML, its worth the effort!",4
68170,"A good introduction to ML applications, but not as detailed and thorough as I expected. I'm looking forward to the following of the specialization.",4
68171,Assignments could have been little more difficult.,4
68173,Great introductory course for beginners to machine learning and I loved the programming tutorials.,4
68177,Thanks!!!,4
68183,"I really enjoyed this course and found it fun to use the iPython notebook to play around with the ML models. The instructors were great, but I encountered some issues in the assignments for the last two weeks where the understanding that was provided in the lectures wasn't enough to pass the assignment. Since all the machine learning models are used as a black box, I think it would be beneficial to audit this course and then pay for the others in the specialization. Nevertheless, I truly feel like I have a good high level understanding of Machine Learning.",4
68192,Awesome Teaching Technique Used! Kudos To The Team!,4
68194,The deep learning part of the course needs to be better done. The rest is good,4
68195,Interesting but a bit weak for my purposes...,4
68198,Great course for beginners in machine learning.It has created a lot of interest in the field and looking with great expectations for the upcoming implementation courses for the inbuilt functions we used in this course.,4
68201,"This course is good enough for introductory level, and knowledge. However keep in mind that:If you are new to Python, you are in for a quite big a challenge. The course are kind enough to walk you through machine learning steps, BUT will not hold your hands through Python programming.The course focus on using GraphLab Create, which is free for academic use, NOT for commercial. This look like a bad decision to choose for a MOOC. However, when you find out that one of the instructor is CEO of Turi, things start to come clear.Also, staff are not responsive at all on the discussion forum. The only active one are the students and mentors.",4
68204,Very simple black box approach to ML. Pretty much anyone can start and play around with ML following this course.I would have like to get a bit more into details but this is great introduction course for anyone.,4
68206,"Very good course. I look forward to starting the next ones, in the context of the ML Specialization.One small caveat: I would have preferred using a more widespread and open source ML library, than GraphLab Create, which I am not certain to encounter again in the ""real"" World.",4
68215,"Good Course for someone wanting an overview of techniques. You would not be building something very cool after this. Course assignments are not very challenging, some good questions must be included.Some mathematical part should be there. Expecting it in other courses in specialization.",4
68219,"I really enjoyed the practical part of showing concrete examples and direct applications of Machine Learning algorithms.Instructors are dynamic and have made efforts to show enthusiasm.Quiz are too easy though. Completing most of the work would only require an hour or so per week. I hope that the other courses are way more intense and require more work.Overall, I would recommend this introductory course.",4
68222,"It seems a very good foundations course, it would be great to dive into more technical aspects, specially because I suppose the majority of us has a background related to maths, statistics, cs, etc. Very useful indeed, hope the studd that comes ahead gets even better. Congratulations. Also, it would be great to learn these methods using other ML libraries, like open source / free ones. All the best, Alexis",4
68224,Some quiz questions' answers are incorrect and instructors need to update the quit to reflect correct answers,4
68225,"Very clearly explained, easy-to-follow pace and great examples.would have been absolutely great if there were references to do the same exercises using pandas/scikit",4
68238,I love what I am learning in this course however some of the lectures are completely disconnected from the quizzes. They could do a better job quizzing based on the lecture.,4
68239,"Thanks, great course!. I'm trying to learn more about ML",4
68241,"The course is great, but it would be greater if used open source free tools.",4
68242,Its a good course for those who want to learn ML with Graph Lab,4
68243,This course gives a good summary of the general machine learning pipeline. However the depth of the course is very low. Also the it uses a commercial python library to implement the models. For these two reasons the course has little value on its own. But this is a good starting point for anyone who wishes to complete the specialization.,4
68254,A very interesting course! I learned a lot. Will continue on the next course once it ready.,4
68256,Very informative and useful course,4
68265,"This is a great introductory Machine Learning Course. The required knowledge is almost nothing, so it starts really basic, but got more interesting on the last weeks.It focus on a practical approach. You will use GraphLab, a powerful tool that allows to easily start applying ML algorithms on real cases, even with just a basic theoretical understanding about why this works.It made me think a lot how can I take advantage of this tools, and I'm excited about start working on some new projects.",4
68275,Interesting intro class. Will very much leave you wanting more.,4
68276,Well-made.Good teachers.But a bit too simple. 4/5Thanks.,4
68279,It' a fine beginner's course. I liked the hands-on approach using SFrames.,4
68284,"The only way these courses could be better if there were far more of them from the same professors. If more of the nitty gritty details of these algorithms were fleshed out in all their glory, more algorithms, more mathematical derivations & more tutorials in the programming languages & libraries used. Otherwise, these MOOCs are near perfection. A very, very nice introduction for beginners with just a little bit of math & not too much programming. Just enough for busy people. I've reserved that 5th star due to the slow pace that the MOOCs have been released (which will presumably be irrelevant for future machine learners) & the fact that there really needs to be more of these very high quality moocs. So there aren't enough of them, so I reserve a star. Hopefully in the future that will be irrelevant as well in which case I'll regret not indicating 5 stars.",4
68288,"I enjoyed the course.I wish it had more machine data driven models to to address more industrial type problems, for instance Predictive maintenance.",4
68294,"Great course. Good for a broad overview. If you already know basic concepts like regression, classifiers, etc from a statistics class it might be a little slow. Also, the class is taught using graph lab which is not a free software. If you wanted to try it something else that is free, you could... But you will spend a LOT more time on the assignments.",4
68295,"Good on presenting and using ML tools, but the part of principle is not good enough",4
68296,the best introduction for ML.,4
68299,"Great Course, just felt little weak the last module about deep learning.",4
68300,dont really like the dependency with dato sframe or prop tools,4
68303,It would be perfect if also cover a section on spark an mllib.,4
68304,"A great introductory course to Machine Learning for anyone with experience programming. It's presented as a survey of various Machine Learning techniques and I appreciated seeing many motivating examples for the topics covered. The hands-on examples were accessible, but at the same time gave familiarity with real-world tools like IPython.",4
68314,An awesome course to get a basic idea about various machine learning techniques. Would've been great if instructions for scikit learn were also provided in the videos,4
68316,"A great course , I loved the combination of theory and practice , the study cases really helped cement the understanding. Both professors were coherent , didactic and helpful in advancing my understanding of machine learning. Their quirky, nerdy humor was endearing, their knowledge noticeable and impressive.I'm definitely going to continue auditing the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm still trying to use graphlab as much as possible, SFrames are so similar to pandas dataframe that it's not hard to do , however , plotting more complicated graphs than a scatter or line is still sometimes a challenge.I strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to explore and strengthen machine learning concepts in a vey applied manner. Congrats to the team at UW",4
68320,"Actually the course goes great, just a cuople onf the intro video are useless, and in fact distract the real value of the course in its first week",4
68324,Overall the course had a good mix of depth and breadth. There should be examples in the presentations and notebooks to help drive home the concepts better.,4
68326,"Excellent course, very charming professors, accessible even for people with limited math/coding backgrounds. Some course material needs to be updated, though.",4
68330,"Very nice designed course!Only flaw is its stuck with a paid license of Graphlab and doesnt focus on free source so that algorithm can be used with the help of free modules in future.It would have been better if the examples were done using free tools, like scikit learn",4
68339,Very basic overview using GraphLab Create to emphasize intuition - if you are familiar with ML concepts might be a bit boring.,4
68353,Very informative and make the machine learning experience much easier for a beginner to all these new concepts. This course is very well set up to help students into the future apply there new knowledge. Only thing is the software was a little difficult to at first get working on my mac but other than that everything was fabulous.,4
68381,This course is very good. The only problem is that instead of using open source packages like scikit-learn they decided to based it on proprietary GraphLab (which is free only for academic use).,4
68383,"This course was a good teaser. Everything is very easy and fun. At the same time, you can see how powerful graphlab is.",4
68392,"I really enjoyed the intro, I would suggest that you take a bit of Python, and Brush up on your Calculus, because you will be needing it. It's possible to keep up conceptually, but I barley made it, and am taking some Python, and Calculus to make sure I'm not waisting time learning skills that are needed in the course, and can focus on the material being presented.",4
68393,this is really good,4
68395,The materials are very interesting. Great introductory course. There are a few problems that need workaround if you are using Amazon AWS to complete the quiz. Need some FAQ section for people who are using Amazon AWS. Wish there are some documents reference python/learn. Excited to take the deeper course but need to upgrade the computer instead of using AWS again.,4
68396,A good introduction tot he tools and possibilities of machine learning.,4
68411,"Good introduction, the python quick description is short enough.",4
68418,"Many practical examples for usages of machine learning.Almost concepts, no hard math works.Recommend for beginners who interested in machine learning but did not have any math background.",4
68422,"Really exciting and amazing. I liked the approach of starting with case studies, it makes the full understanding of the entire course easier and concrete.",4
68429,"A different version of graphlab was used without I think being duly noted, some functions work differently in newer versions. For the rest it was very good.",4
68430,I have just completed the course.I have got an overview of how machine learning works.What I felt is that the course is a very good one for the beginners in ML.PS: Increase the toughness and level of the questions in the quiz,4
68431,Very nice content but dont like we use graphlab since i wont use it after course,4
68434,"very good for one who has no idea about machine learning , but I dont like dato",4
68435,Good primer to Machine Learning - uses real world examples to introduce different machine learning concepts in an interesting way.,4
68444,This is very good material for machine learning starters.,4
68446,Good introductory course.,4
68449,This course provides a quick and easy introduction to machine learning and python. I enjoy the learning experience. The materials have room for improvement: there are typos and redundancies.,4
68451,"Pros:a) A good overview on machine learning, with case studies that are practical and can really help you remember what machine learning is about.b) It requires Python, which is a language that more are familiar with than R.Cons:a) It uses a proprietary (and expensive) Python module. It's free for academic use, but if you want to go into data science startups, using GraphLab may not be as practical, as, say, pandas.b) If you want a more detailed discussion, go for the next courses, or read an ML textbook.Overall, I'm happy with what I learned.",4
68453,"Really great intro to machine learning - I think this class would have been better if the programming assignments had been a bit more difficult, but overall really enjoyed this class and looking forward to continuing with the specialization.",4
68459,homework could be more complicated,4
68464,"Decent intro, though it would be a lot more useful if the professor didn't use his Software and instead thought us implementations using python/R which are used in most commercial applciations",4
68466,"This course start from problem. So this great to motivate the content. However, there are lot of confusion questions that lead to miss understand the exercise problems.",4
68473,Excellent course. Looking forward to the rest of the courses.,4
68476,A good introductory level course,4
68477,"Machine Learning Foundations was an excellent overview of the many areas within machine learning and how these techniques can be applied to solving real world problems. Now, I look forward to continuing with the remaining courses of the Machine Learning Specialization.",4
68478,Very good balance of concept and practice. Would be 5 stars if all tools are open source.,4
68489,A Brief understanding achieved! I love the instructor and the way they conduct the class.,4
68496,Very insightfull,4
68497,"Nicely structured and overall a great course. Sometimes a little slow, for my preference.",4
68499,Great overview and broad foundation of all techniques,4
68509,"Good for a introductory course if someone is getting started with machine learning, but as part of an specialization i think is useless (for people who are planning to take all the specialization).",4
68515,"It's a practical approach to different machine learning techniques, it would be great not to depend a lot of DATO, but I think at the other hand that dependency allows to focus in machine learning than in program things with python.",4
68517,It is a great introduction but this could be done by adding a week more in each of the following courses.,4
68518,Good course.,4
68539,"Really good theoretical introduction but couldn't do some of the tasks because my python skills weren't up to scratch, however the course says you don't need any previous python knowledge, so I disagree with that. However, overall a really good introduction.",4
68545,"Thank you very much for the course. I have developed my algorithm on Matlab environment, so far. I have introduced to Python with the help of the course and have obtained much crucial information about machine learning.",4
68553,Good for an introduction class.,4
68556,This course has given a good introduction to the broad topics of ML and what I will be taught in the next 5 courses in the specialisation and gave me a reason to be excited.,4
68558,Installation of the recommended toolkit is tricky and very expensive if perused non-academically.Content is clear and well presented.,4
68564,-great introduction .-go through a lot of exciting topics.-but the implementation part is boring something.,4
68565,Enjoyed this class.,4
68567,"Just the tip of the iceberg, you'll want to dive in on each topic.",4
68568,"I think the text of the programming assignments could be improved. The minimum that should be done, I think, is to do some serious proofreading. I found a lot of mistakes in language (and English is not my native language).",4
68572,Great course! Hope the slides gets better annotated.,4
68574,its a good course to get hands on development with machine learning algorithms. but one disadvantage being its using preparatory library,4
68577,"Very good introductory course, especially to someone with little knowledge of ML. My only frustration is that I have some background in machine learning, so not very much new material- I would have skipped this and jumped straight into the the regression models course, but you need to complete them all to unlock the capstone (which looks really, really cool!)",4
68578,Great hands-on and practical introduction to graphlab and python that is pretty useful in the later courses. I great way of starting a specialization with an overview and small samples of what we are going to learn.,4
68582,"The last module was a bit hard for me to understand, but everything else was presented in a very clear way. Great class overall and highly recommended for those with some basic Python skills and a desire to see what machine learning is capable of.",4
68586,Very practical and the contents are good. But the quizzes are just too simple and the analysis on the cases are not deep enough.,4
68587,"Although is a good for a start, and Graphlab framework is state-of-art software. I would like the same content developed using mainstream opensource frameworks like pandas, scipy, numpy, etc.One of my interest in this courses was that they used python instead of R (which I don't like too much for it's inconsistencies). Python is faster and more reliable.",4
68588,I wish they would rely in something else than a proprietary package for the course.... but besides that it's a great course.,4
68590,The ML Foundations course provides a good overview of the other courses in the specialization. It also provides a good introduction to GraphLab.,4
68591,The course is fantastic and presented well. I never got my feet under me because i had a lot going on at work. Does have some linear algebra pre-reqs that you can brush up @ khan acedemy.,4
68594,"Great course! I think much of it will make a lot more sense in hindsight after I've gone through some of the other courses in the specialization. The main reason I'm not giving it a full five stars are the many mistakes and ambiguity, especially in some of the assignments.",4
68597,"Great course. Super case driven approach, professors are very clear.",4
68599,It easy to start and content is less mathemetical and ready to use knowledge. And tool are helpful to start playing with. May be later go into details . It's perfect for software engineer not having knowledge of ML but wants to start. One can play with data after this course I think.,4
68602,Was nice!,4
68604,Very good general overview of ML. I put 4 stars instead of 5 because too much focus is made on Graphlab for the hands on exercises. The focus of this course is not on the tool itself however one should know that this is the primary library used for the exercises. Details are given for those who wants to use other library but the foundation of the course are clearly to present and showcase Dato's product.,4
68605,Last module on Deep learning is not explained well as compared to other modules.,4
68606,"It was overview of things that one does using ML. The instructors focused just on the concepts, leaving the internal working on algorithms and that helps someone is very new to this field to first get a broader picture",4
68610,The course is very simple so far. Hope it's just because it's the first one in the specialization. Love the teaching style.,4
68612,Very good though a steep learning curve at the last lessons - inspiring lectures as well as practical cases :) Looking forward to the next ML courses :)),4
68617,Instructors are clear and passional about their teaching. I wish the course was slightly deeper.,4
68620,Very nicely compiled set of lectures: I am new to machine learning and am finding this course very conducive to understanding some key ML algorithms using a case-study approach.,4
68624,a very good introduction for machine learning with good examples and explainations,4
68640,"The course is great, you do learn a lot of the general concepts. I wish they would use general python packages instead of graphlab, but this is not a deal breaker.",4
68642,"Instructors are enthusiastic and interesting to watch; the course content is at the appropriate level of abstraction to build curiosity without getting lost int he weeds. Assignments (except for deep learning) do require some coding knowledge, but script kiddies like myself can pass. Taking one star off because of the strong emphasis on using the GraphLab environment rather than standard FLOSS libraries in Python (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) or R.",4
68646,Most of the course was fantastically composed but 15% of it felt a little bit sloppy. I was lucky to be not the pioneer of the course because of the discussions which helped me out quickly in these rare occasions. I would give 4.5 starts if it would be possible.,4
68648,"This was a great overview into the history and current techniques in ML. I am an engineer in process control, so there are areas where I see this could be used. I like the fact that NN's found a place finally which is working well. Obviously the purpose of the course was not to delve too far into the maths, and as such ""sells"" the software which is a tad costly. Point however is the purpose of the course met the intent, and I found it really interesting and worth the time ! Thanks for this",4
68650,Gives a high-level understanding of machine learning concepts and focuses a lot on its application part.,4
68654,"In general a good course, well presented.4 start only due to some assignment questions not being covered in lectures",4
68655,Case study approach followed in this courser is very use full and helps to understand the methods better.,4
68660,A very practical course. Like Emily.,4
68676,Good Start up with case study approach to just understand what we gonna learn in further specialization.,4
68678,"Awesome module, but the Deep Learning course should be redone in my honest opinion. The explanation for it is on way too high of a level compared to the other courses within this module and way too bogged down in the details.",4
68683,Great introduction to Machine Learning Specialization and the various algorithms employed in the different courses. In my opinion every Specialization should have an introductory course that covers the various different things that will form the focus of each subsequent course so that students do not start the Specialization and find out down the line that the Specialization is not quite what they expected.,4
68686,I really like this course. Very nice introduction to ML. The only downside is that it would be nice to have some comments on how to implement the algorithms without using Graphlab,4
68696,"Pros: Good course organization, very good explanations, a nice introduction to basic concepts of Machine Learning, because the entire specialization is created by the same instructions it has good continuity and there is a sense of logical progression between courses.Cons: The instructions on the assignments can be a little confusing for absolute beginners (but the forums are a very good source for help), the license to use the GraphLab Create framework for free for this entire specialization expires after just a year.",4
68700,Great specialization series! The way of covering concepts is very interesting. I find it somewhat difficult to solve the assignment using Pandas and scikit-learn. The assignments should be provided with enough help for solving them using these open source tools.,4
68705,"Could have explained a little more about what we were doing for some of the modules. For example, in week 6, I didn't really understand the 'deep_features' column or how the values for that column were generated for each picture.",4
68708,"A good course, but I found the programming exercises fairly underwhelming. It is just an overview course, so it is what it is.",4
68717,The course is an excellent starter to understand the foundations of Machine Learning. The Assignments could a bit more involved and have more rigor,4
68723,"This course is very fun especially the lecturers. Beside that, all the topics have contextual sample that very easy to understand",4
68724,"One of the assignments had wrong answers for some of the questions, which made passing it a bit tedious. Other than that, it was a fairly descent course.",4
68732,Useful course. Covered good amount of usecases for Machine learning concepts with handson experience.,4
68741,"Great introduction to the various topics of the specialization. Introducing each of these topics in a generic way helps to get a sense of what they are about, and what to expect from the specialization. It might be a good idea to be explicit about the fact that this course really only has value added in conjunction with the other courses, and not really as a stand-alone module.",4
68742,Deep learning session is a bit unclear in that it doesn't give a pratical example of how a simple Nueral network can be mapped to a deep-feature.,4
68747,Very nice introduction to Machine Learning and to Python programming language,4
68748,The overall course was very useful.However some topics I found difficulty to understand the idea even after repeating the video 3 times.,4
68749,"Good structure, but maybe a bit too basic and slow pace.",4
68752,"Most of it I already knew, but was nice.",4
68755,Great course. Maybe a little bit too basic.,4
68774,"Very good introduction to machine learning, quickly enables the student to perform regression, classifications, etc. but it would be nice if the course went into a little more detail, the quizzes are very superficial. It would also be beneficial to explore examples of applications across different fields.",4
68783,Very good course for getting a high level understanding of the Machine learning concepts.,4
68784,Hands on should have been more involved/dificult.,4
68787,Very good approach to this topic. Very good explanation even of complex subjects. It is a general overview and allow the student to have a basic knowledge of all machine learnings sub-topics. Maybe to depended on dato dato framework.,4
68788,Real life applications....thrust them till the end (even if I'm not comfortable learning from such good but branded teachers),4
68790,"The course was taught well, however I thought there could have been a few more videos with more details. Although I understand that it's really an overview course.",4
68794,Really interesting course that gives a great introduction to Machine Learning. Might be a little too much for someone with no programming or statistics experience.,4
68797,Very nicely done course.I have to note that I was not sure how to get help as I was stuck on a issue. I was able to finally figure out but the instructors are unresponsive :(.,4
68801,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. This is a very good introduction to the whole Machine Learning Specialization series given the topics covered, especially with practical cases. However, as a standalone course it lacks depth for a 5 star rating.",4
68803,I found here all I need for first step in ML. Thank you. But Assignment you should make different. I mean varied tasks but not the same for each new attempt.,4
68807,"The course its a pretty good introduction to machine learning, we explored different technics, models and alghoritms. Im very pleased of what I learned in this course. 4 Stars because some explications needs a little more detail.",4
68813,"Well designed and executed in the main. As videos are recorded once but viewed thousands of times it would have been nice if they had taken more time to write a script and look more professional - also mistakes in the videos that don't match the current material are few, but very annoying.",4
68814,Great Introduction to Generic Machine Learning Concepts.One suggestion to the teachers would be to include an optional programming section just to introduce GraphLab to users. There is a lot of API calls which are explained on the go but a high level view of the library with the relevant structuring of APIs would be helpful.,4
68824,I found this to be an excellent course. Both the instructors are excited about the work they are doing and do a good job of teaching the materials. I don't have a statistics background and college calculus is more than a little fuzzy. I was still able to understand most of the course.,4
68839,Very good course since it give you a high level view on Machine Learning. It would had been useful to have complementary readings and examples using other libraries,4
68840,"Great introduction to machine learning concepts with nice assignments. It seems there needs to be some cleanup performed so that the lectures and content match up a bit better. Overall a useful and approachable course to motivate the need for additional study in the rest of the ""specialization.""",4
68841,very basic,4
68850,"Great Course, I really enjoy it. Compared with other machine learning courses, I think this one is really a good start, for its using of examples close to our life.",4
68853,"Pros:1. Practical and hands on approach2. How multiple problems like prediction, sentiment analysis, text retrieval etc can be mapped to a common ML modelCons:1. Uses DATO toolkit which is a licensed tool.2. Maths behind any used technique is not discussed, which I think is an issue.",4
68860,Effectively introduces to the basics of all different machine learning algorithms through case studies. The recommended tools are easy to use and understand,4
68864,Really great one!!,4
68872,"At times, this course feels like an extended advertisement for Graphlab Create, which was founded by one of the instructors. The case studies are all quite interesting, however. I would not recommend this course, except that the following course is awesome and this course is helpful preparation for the regression course. The best part of this course is the interaction between the instructors, who are very fun.",4
68878,"I really liked the enthusiastic lecturers and the ""easy"" to learn approach. with that the exercises were easy and meaningful :)",4
68879,"Pretty good, overall.",4
68881,Good course with the overview of different machine learning techniques,4
68882,"good overview, a little bit hard regarding the deep learning course, that would require more explanations",4
68885,Good intro to topics in machine learning as well as to Graphlab Create and iPython Notebook.,4
68887,"Overall, this is an interesting course that covers a lot of different topics in a compact manner. I also appreciated the combination of broad ""pictures"" about the different ML algorithms and ML in general.I only gave four stars and not five because of the lab parts. Even if the topics were clearly of interest, they are really on the easy side. On top of that, using graphlab sometimes hiders the comprehension. It would have been nice to go more into the details of (at least some simple) algorithms. There is a balance between user experience (how easy it is to use powerful algorithms such as deep learning and see in practice their results) and learning experience (how much I do really myself). I feel that the balance is too much geared towards user experience. I would have been rewarding to implement some simple algorithms ourselves (such as basic regression, popularity classifier, ...).",4
68888,This is a great course.,4
68892,A great tutorial on using machine learning tools and a very basic intro into machine learning concepts. Doesn't go into how they work at all which is what the other courses are for.Given its basically a tutorial for graphlab create (awesome but commercial software) it would be nice if it also covered pandas directly also. If people are really expecting to head into this field they are likely at some point going to have to use the cheaper tools.It would be great if this module was optional for the larger machine learning certificate. That said I found this class was valuable in preparing me for the next courses in that it got me familiar with the tools and the rhythm of the quizes and assignments. Someone more studious or smarter than me may find this course less valuable.,4
68893,"Interesting! The lecturers were good. Though sometimes, things get boring. But overall, the subject and the quizzes were exciting!",4
68895,I cannot review my completed homework. It's very boring.,4
68900,"Fantastic course! Great teachers and very nice to see real-world applications in action. Would have rated 5 stars if an open source library like scikit-learn were used. Students can still use sklearn, but all the examples are using GraphLab Create, a great library, but you need a very expensive (at least for my budget) license to use it commercially.",4
68901,Great introduction to ML concepts! I'm hoping to dig a little deeper in the next courses!,4
68902,"This course covers all basic machine learning tasks, including the new emerging technology like deep learning. The programming assignments are very interesting, face to real world applications, have an appropriate difficulty and are with good written guide. However, tools used in the course are SFrame and Dato Graphlab. If you are using popular toolkits including scikit-learn and pandas, you will be in trouble to set up the corresponding random seeds and fail to get the correct answer.",4
68904,I enjoyed this course but I think assignments could be a little bit more difficult.,4
68907,"Excellent course! My only ""complaint"" really is that I wish the instructors would use other tools besides GraphLab. I realize that this does make it a lot easier, but I'm sure many of us work in environments where we cannot use GraphLab (for a variety of reasons) and it would be most helpful it they demonstrated how to accomplish the same thing solely using open source alternatives.",4
68910,Cool,4
68911,"Very nice for those of people who want to learn the concepts of machine learning. However, libraries that used (which are not pandas and scikit-learn) was not satisfying for me. Googling about those libraries was totally difficult while there are lots of documents using pandas and scipy.",4
68922,"A good course to show the extent of what is coming up in the specialization, a quick and dirty hands-on approach and pleasant course tutors.",4
68926,Thank you Emily & Carlos! I really enjoyed the course. It was very well taught with clear explanations. Looking forward to the rest of the courses!,4
68930,"It was more about learning DATO then any insight. However I understand that this course is good motivator for beginners, but was very boring for me.",4
68934,"Loved the course, the teachers, the case study approach.",4
68938,A great high level overview and introduction to machine learning. The topics broadly cover different machine learning algorithms and their approaches. The only downside is that the proprietary library they use to teach the concepts is incredibly expensive for an individual to license.,4
68955,a good introduction of the topics. I like the ML diagram in each module.,4
68957,Great course! I had to watch some of the videos over and over again for the material to really sink in but after I understood what's happening it was very enlightening. This course will really get you hooked into learning data science!,4
68961,Provides a good overview of the machine learning branches. Makes sense to approach it as a black box and then take deep dives in later series.,4
68969,"It is great to understand overall machine leacning technique. However, one thing which is not good is we should use dato's product, graphlab almost mandotorily. This product is very expensive, so we would be hard time persuading our company to purchase the license. I think it is much better for course student to have special offer from dato",4
68970,"very nice! A little bit more of reading material would be interesting, though..",4
68978,"This course was simple. Since it is intended as an overview of few machine learning techniques used to build computer based rational agents it has completely fulfilled my curiosity about what intelligent applications can be built using machine learning algorithms. Professors Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin did an excellent job of presenting the course in an engaging way and with enough hands-on exercises to better understand the lessons.I am excited to take the next specialization courses to better understand the inner workings of each algorithm, and perhaps manage to understand why these algorithms work the way they do, specially the Deep Learning algorithms.Thank you Coursera for the opportunity and thank the Professors Emily and Carlos for such a valuable gift of sharing knowledge for free.",4
68980,A good global introduction and simply explained. With fun as well....,4
68986,+ Excellent video lectures.+ Good overview of the field.+ Nice working examples with good instruction video's.-- No help with the practical assignments although the Python examples given are not flawless.,4
68987,The case study approach works perfectly to enhance motivation,4
68988,The content and articulation was excellent. Inspired and motivated me to continue the course in spite of my struggle to understand certain concepts. There are lot more statisticians out there who are heaps better than myself and it was excellent experience to read the questions and answers in the discussion forum. Will continue the course and get my certification and enroll for capstone project as well.,4
68991,"Very good hands-on approach to practical machine learning. However, as the models get more complicated, some of the material isn't really explained very well, specially the last module about 'deep learning' is quite superfluous. I also wish, the course favored providing a bit more mathematical intuition over just graphlab usage. All things aside, if you are really curious about machine learning you should take this course. Be hungry!",4
68995,"Great course design and case study! More detail about algorithm will be better, but maybe you can find them more in the following courses.",4
69002,The homework assignments were not really about having understood the course,4
69008,A nice introduction to the various machine learning concepts.,4
69010,"A phenomenal, deliberately shallow introduction to Machine Learning. This course definitely cannot standalone but serves as a great start to the specialization.There was a great deal of sensitivity in the course due to the use of Dato Graphlab, particularly since one of the instructors is the CEO of Dato and the software is not free for commercial use. This was exacerbated because the color scheme of the presentation slides matches the color scheme of the Dato website.However putting this aside the material is very high quality. The use of case studies is inspired and helps students focus on when to use particular ML techniques. Although the material is a little shallow (deliberately) you get a good high-level feel for what techniques are applicable in specific situations. However the course can't really standalone, and it's intended as part of the specialization.",4
69015,"This course is a pretty cool intro to the GraphLab Create library. However, I would have preferred something more challenging, even for a survey course.Though the discussion forums were generally very active (I posted at least one question that was answered by a TA very promptly), there was a question I had towards the end of the course that never got answered. I wasn't alone in this... many people were having a very similar problem.In general, I think the course was good. But, if you have even a very shallow familiarity with Machine Learning and/or Python, you may be able to skip this one and move straight into the Regression course.",4
69019,"It'd be 5/5 if it used scikit-learn, instead of proprietary software (albeit with 1yr free to use license for non-commercial purposes)",4
69026,This was a fantastic course for someone both unfamiliar with machine learning algorithms and python.,4
69028,"This is the introductory course to a series of courses designed to teach machine learning through case studies. The introductory course provided a nice overview of key machine learning techniques in the context of common applications of machine learning (case studies). The concepts are taught in Python using the high-level DATO GraphLab libraries, so the course provides a good introduction to using the machine learning techniques that are provided in DATA GraphLab rather than on learning the mathematics behind the techniques.I am investigating the capabilities and advantages and disadvantages of existing frameworks such as Pandas and DATO GraphLab, so this course met my needs, but it would probably not be as useful to data scientists who are interested in learning the underlying principles, mathematics and numerical methods used in machine learning.I would have given the course a rating of five IF it had done a better job of describing the fundamental principles of machine learning and if it had made it easier to use a non-commercial framework such as Pandas.I'm planning to take the next course in the series in the hope that it will provide more in-depth coverage of the fundamental principles of machine learning than the introductory course.",4
69043,I think the course met my expectations – it's super high-level and does not at all go over the underlying algorithms involved. I give it 4 stars because I have this feeling like this specialization is an underhanded way to sell the Dato GraphLab Create product. There's a bit of a conflict of interest going on here.,4
69044,A good introduction to machine learning,4
69047,Last section was tedious. Access to a year long graphlab licence was nice though especially since I graduated as an undergraduate in 2014 and am no longer a student.,4
69053,This is a nice entry-level course on Machine Learning. Emily and Carlos show their enthusiasm for ML and engage students in the subjects they are teaching.The video lectures have a nice format in which you can see the professor while he/she is explaining the presented slides. This makes the course feel less online and more personal.The course makes special emphasis on the practical side of the presented material. All the modules have a practical part in which you practice the theory presented.,4
69054,"The instructors a fantastic comedic duo! I had numerous laugh out loud moments while getting a much better handle on machine learning. The instruction is clear and the homeworks are always interesting and well thought out.I really only have one complaint: Graphlab. Graphlab is a fantastic piece of software that makes data science easy. I was amazed at how much harder it was for me to complete the home works with scikit and pandas. Unfortunately, it's very unlikely that any future employer will be using Graphlab. It's a great intro for noobs (like me), but it's very expensive and can be replicated with open source packages. As such, I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out on my own how to perform graph lab operations in the open source world. Avoiding this kind of slow, frustrating, stack exchange binging, 50 tab opening, nonsense is one of reasons I take MOOCs in the first place. I hope a future version sets up the bones of what open source packages can be used to solve each problem set.In summary, I really enjoyed this class. I was excited to work on it. I learned things that made me more productive at work. I felt the joy of learning. I was disappointed by the insistence on Graphlab but if making the sales case for it is what motivated Carlos and Emily to put the class together, it's worth the frustration. I'm extremely grateful to both of them for putting this together.",4
69055,"I like the GraphLab coding，and this course is an intro, not too much details, if you want to go further, better take the other courseras in this class.",4
69062,"Interesting class, but should have used open source python libraries instead of restricted license libraries.",4
69065,good material. good presentation skills of the instructor,4
69069,"Excellent case study approach. Hopefully, other methods-rather than graphlab- will be included as well in future courses.",4
69070,"Really great course content, but the assignments could become better.",4
69074,Very didatic approach to machine learning. Easy access and still powerful technique to understand how it works.,4
69084,"The course, as intended was just an overview, which sometimes can leave the student with a lot of questions. (which i guess was intentional too). Also i feel the instructors were trying a bit too hard to sound 'cool' and 'fun', or maybe it's just that i am 32 and i cannot relate to it much. The content was excellent and the course serves an ideal platform for the launch of the specialisation.Kindly give other free options of software, since graphlab is paid. I small session on scikit, nolearn or any equivalent machine learning package would be extremely helpful.",4
69087,"The course was overall good in achieving its goal of trying to introduce various machine learning methods, without getting into too much detail. The course used IPython Notebooks, which I found to be a very useful environment for learning. The professors have done an excellent job of presenting the materials with good examples and code.I took a star away because some of the quiz questions did not stimulate my thought process much and relied on remembering terms and definitions. Also, I would have preferred the use of open source Python libraries as much as possible and use GraphLab Create only when using open source libraries would have been very cumbersome or impossible.",4
69093,"Great introduction course on Machine Learning. Got hands on experience to build Regression, classification, clustering, recommending & deep learning model with python and Graphlab.",4
69095,Very good!!! Excellent!!!,4
69096,The instructors are excellent and the material is good. The only drawback is the need to use Graphlab. This would have been a really great course if we had to use open source software.,4
69107,Good introductory course. Provides hands on experience with toy examples that helps to better understand the content. Light on math so should appeal to a wider base. I completed the course in a couple of days. Lecturers are very good with clear exposition of material in most modules. The weakest part was discussion of deep learning but it is hard to fault the course providers since their aim was to provide an overview of the field. Really looking forward to rest of the courses in the specialization to gain more in depth understanding.,4
69111,Useful course to get general idea to get onboard with Machine Learning.,4
69119,"Very well structured, I'm really looking forwards to the next courses.I like how they always start from a real-life, down-to-earth example and work their way up to the technical bits. Everything is clear and explained in detail, and often multiple solutions are proposed: e.g. 'we do A, but this has the problem blah, so we do B..' super good, comparison is the key for understanding. Python notebook is an amazing pedagogical tool, and I really appreciate how the exercises are designed: first go through pre-made code, then tinker to get a few variations.I would like to see a bit more of the 'algorithms' (e.g. could outliers make centroids drift away in kNN? what is the computational complexity of the various functions we're using?) but it's just a minor remark.Way to go guys!",4
69121,Very practical.,4
69127,"This is merely a starter course that gets you acquainted with the basics of ML using Python. I hope to see the instructors cover algorithms in greater detail in the next few courses in the specialization. Also, they focus exclusively on Dato's Graphlab - that's a worry. I was hoping to be introduced to NumPy, SciPy and other python libraries for ML. They could have at least spent some time demonstrating why they thought Graphlab was a better alternative.",4
69128,"Pros: Really fun to watch. Great introduction to several ML algorithms. Offers specific examples that you can follow along with (Python).Cons: Uses a proprietary library to demonstrate concepts.Overall: At first I was concerned if this specialization would be too difficult, but this specific course was surprisingly easy to follow along.Note, I highly recommend the Data Science specialization here on Coursera.",4
69135,Nice for learners who want to jump start in machine learning,4
69145,I love the hands on exercises.,4
69153,"It is giving me inspiration and clarity what we can do if we know machine learning , its clearing clouds to see the sky and letting me to reach it . Thankful to the instructors and to the coursera. love open stuff",4
69160,"Great course, such difficult concepts were taught with great fun.",4
69161,"One of great courses, I found significant improvement of my grammar.",4
69176,Although a few concepts are a bit wishy washy this is a high quality course on leadership.,4
69184,good stuff like the first MOOC thanks valerie,4
69191,One of the best courses by Coursera . It is substantial promotes my leadership.,4
69194,A change I am feeling in myself,4
69196,Excellent way of teaching.,4
69197,Great course and amazing professor.. one of the best Coursera classes I have ever had :),4
69203,"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 1st Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants' learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, that's why I'm not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. I'm referring to guest interview videos. That's mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as it's always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",4
69208,This was a very useful course in the specialization.,4
69211,"excellent , actually and well driven by Mr Randy Hlavac",4
69217,"great course, I will recommend it.",4
69220,"Excellent, really informative and made me assess which strategy would work best for our business.",4
69239,"I enjoyed this course a lot because I've wanted to start blogging, but not sure how I would approach the process. This course taught me all I need to know to get started. If possible, please have the guest speakers talk a bit slower. Thank you!",4
69246,Prof. Hlavac's courses are amazing and easy to comprehend. Finished two courses of Prof. Hlavac. Thanks for the knowledge sir.Mani,4
69248,Good overview with interview,4
69254,I think the course /whole specialization is really good. But I keep getting my paid toolkits really late. Only when I finished the course,4
69256,Great info.,4
69265,"good course.Positives: very practical, interesting assignmentsDevelopment areas: 4 stars because sometimes want more to the point and less not very improtant info in the lections. sorry. for the sake of timeIn overall, a good course. would recommend",4
69268,"Fun and engaging. The blog post assignment is very much for the beginner but there things to learn for the experienced too. Give it a try if you are interested in marketing, branding or social media.",4
69291,"This is a wonderful beginner course for Chinese. I would say it would be great for those who have no prior experience with Chinese, since it is very well made and easy to follow. It gives very well made lessons and is very informative.",4
69302,very easy to follow and great explanations,4
69303,"Awesome course! Thanks for everything! It would however be great if you also could provide the Chinese characters for all the stuff we've learned *while* we learn it and not in the end of the course. :) Best,Vinicius",4
69304,Chinese introduction made easy.,4
69306,Very well explained. I think it will be much better if there is a revision of previous weeks teaching in current week.,4
69307,"This course was good to get the basics and fast forward if you already have some beginners knowledge with the language. Could be more challenging during the quizzes, maybe also more emphasize on writing the words. I can read Chinese more easy than I can write it",4
69309,"I'd say this was a pretty good introduction to Chinese. The main thing this accomplished for me was practicing the tones, which are very challenging. The vocabulary covered was very limited, and the course didn't really stress grammar, so you shouldn't expect to be able to form your own sentences after taking this course. But I think this is at least a good starting point.",4
69312,This course is very useful for beginners without any knowledge of Chinese language and culture.,4
69323,"This course was really helpful in understanding the basics of Mandarin and gave me a little more insight into the Chinese culture and mode of thinking. Chinese no longer looks like an impossible language to understand. Love it! Would love to have a few more printable notes, though.",4
69337,"The course is just brilliantly structured. I imagine that this is a set of expressions to start a journey of love with the Chinese language and culture.I did miss a bit explanations on the gramatical structure of chinese sentences. I.e. position of verbs, times, places, pronouns in the sentences. I kind of figured them out, being them different to the structure of western languages. Google Translate helped often to understand this structure and words.The teacher is JUST lovely. Many thanks for a lovely work!",4
69340,Good basic course.,4
69343,"Thank you for the course! As the title says, this lessons is for beginners who never experienced learning Chinese Language. But I think providing chinese characters in the course will make this course better.",4
69347,"The course is very useful when provide a basic speaking Chinese for beginners. However, i hope that in the fulture the course can also provide somethings about chinese writing.",4
69352,Great for speaking practice and refresher,4
69363,"Easy to understand, Can be used in real life",4
69369,The course is good for beginners. The lessons are short and the teacher is easy to understand. I really need the characters as well as the pinyin. I had to spend time after the lessons to find the characters. Then I saw the sheet at the end of all the lessons that had characters listed for everything. I wish I had known that. It would have saved me some time.,4
69379,"The course provided a solid, clear, and friendly introduction to the basics of speaking & understanding spoken Mandarin, as well as to how Mandarin is written in the Roman alphabet. Vocabulary and grammar points were introduced at a pace that was never too overwhelming. I'd have liked the quizzes to be based on listening to a dialogue or watching a video and then testing comprehension, rather than just on vocabulary. But on the whole, I was pleased. It was exciting, right as the course was ending, to see that I could have a tiny conversation of the ""Do you like autumn?"" and ""We are taking the subway to school"" variety with a Chinese colleague.",4
69384,Good Course for foreigners to learn mandarin but it would be more helpful if the lecturer would slow the pase just a little bit cause we are still beginners and have a hard time understanding the different tones.,4
69389,It will be better when you will give hieroglyphs with pinyin.,4
69391,"Introduction to basic vocabulary and grammar. I give it 4 stars because it does not discuss any characters, just uses pinyin.",4
69394,This is a great intro course to Chinese! I would like to see the characters were written above the words as you learn to simply become familiar with some of the common characters. I am grateful for the access this course provides for those traveling to China to respectfully communicate and show interested in the Chinese culture.,4
69424,Great work¡¡¡ and you can practise your oral skills =),4
69433,"Great course to get a beginners exposure to the chinese language. Liked the practical concept of the lectures, aiming towards sentences and phrases that can be used in daily interaction.",4
69435,v good and I learn v easy,4
69440,"I think it is a very good course, but for me, it was too dense, which led to me not finishing it. More emphasis should be on repetition and deepening of the acquired knowledge.",4
69441,"Very nice course! It was very interesting for me to learn Mandarin as I was totally new to this language. We went through 7 weeks of lectures which don't take much time. Literally 10 min per day is enough. Now i know a lot but unfortunately still can't really talk. I'm looking forward for another course, because these 7 weeks were not enough for me)",4
69442,"I love learning Chinese with this course! The instructor could be better, but all around",4
69458,materials are nice.....but if the video of alphabets of chinese were also included then it will be a great help,4
69460,Is so hard learning Chinese but this is a good course :),4
69466,Very Hard To speak But Great Course !!!,4
69469,Lesson is easy to understand. Need to make more time to yourself for practice.,4
69472,Good for the beginner.,4
69476,This was a very easy course and not too daunting considering the topic. I liked learning pronounciations of the words and the basic vocabulary. A great starter course.,4
69479,"Really good course. But you need to study hard, because not everything is written on the board.",4
69481,"Really good, bite-sized information to get started on Mandarin",4
69483,Very good lessons. Slow and progressive,4
69486,After many technical issues I decided to try the course using my phone.... and it worked! I enjoyed the rest of the course immensely! :-) I have given this course four stars instead of five as I feel there should have been a few more interactive quizzes to really imbed the target language. I actually used what I learned to chat to some Chinese people in my area! What a wonderful feeling. :-),4
69488,Very good for beginners!,4
69513,"Quizes got glitchy however, overall content is fantastic!!!(Wouldnt recomend taking for certification... better suited for fun ;)",4
69518,the explanation is very cool. Sometimes the course goes a bit slow.,4
69520,Very nice but very primary level is taught.,4
69526,Most of the lessons are available for beginners of Chinese. It is useful to understand.,4
69535,Very useful for getting started in Mandarin!,4
69548,"This is a very good introduction to Chinese, but would help to people that doesn´t have any person to practice match with some people online that would like to chat or talk with the students of the course.It will be nice, to include some part of the phonetic of the words to understand how is a better speaking.",4
69553,This program was very use full.,4
69561,It would be nice to add characters to videos,4
69566,This course is definitely helpful for those who has not learned Chinese before as well as who has learned a bit Chinese.The exercises are well prepared and help learners to review all the lessons logically.,4
69569,It´ll be great if you could show us how to write 汉子。,4
69572,i wish there were more lessons i can take the course forever :),4
69574,good course for traveler but there are a little of grammar part so you can speak a simple sentence but if you want to create some new sentence it's quite hard.,4
69584,Really good for understanding the basics of Chinese in pinyin!,4
69585,I missed out the characters during the lessons,4
69594,Very interesting to learn the basis of Chinese ; very simple and clear!It is also a good basis to prepare the HSK but in my opinion it would have been interesting to have also the chinese characters writen in order to learn both at the same time!,4
69602,very helpful,4
69604,"Good course for beginners. In my opinion, its strong point is simplicity (it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful, and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all) and broad range of topics (probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China). What I didn't like in this course is lack of explanation: student is required to memorize entire sentences, but nothing was said about word ordering, personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language. I would also like to have more tests/ exercises with feedback, probably some review tests covering previous lessons.",4
69605,too easy and no characters,4
69608,"Everything is very well! Ilike the material and the professor who is teaching us. She is very good. Thank you very much. But the only problem for me is that the wrong pronunciation is given by the professor. For me it wasa psycological issue. Because, I would remember the variant how you should not do! AndI think it is better to make an example only the right variant and repeting this several times as a tongue twister. During the course I am trying to avoid this wrong examples, trying to scroll later and not to hear them. Everything else I like very much!",4
69614,"It was fun, and a nice refresher for me as it has been nearly a decade since I spoke in Chinese.",4
69615,Interesting lessons! Quizzes could be improved with sentence translations.Chinese characters could be shown with pinyin in order to be able to recognize them.,4
69625,"Very nice course... but very, very basic.",4
69626,Liked it very much! Easy for beginners and it created much interest for China!,4
69629,Excellent introduction to a beautiful language,4
69635,I already attended a Chinese for Beginners course years ago. This course was excellent for brushing up words and sentence constructions. Excellent course also for completely beginners. I hope that there will be additional courses. Thanks!,4
69638,I really liked this course because all the lessons are coherent with each other which helps one understand Chinese better. I hope that the quizzes would be more difficult to fully test the student's competence.,4
69643,"Overall this course is really helpful when it comes to grammar and sentence structuring. You get experience with a lot of vocabulary as well. I gave the course four stars because Chinese characters aren't taught or covered at all, just pinyin. Which is fine, but it would be nice to have those briefly introduced as well.",4
69657,Excelent course from beginners!!,4
69659,"Quite ok, but maybe a bit hard at the beginning",4
69671,"Excellent course for a beginner or post-beginner as the fundamentals of pronunciation are dealt with slowly in the first half and then it races ahead with useful language and vocabulary for everyday contemporary situations like talking about hobbies, using the internet, etc etc. Stylistically, the Professor may seem dry and mechanical to some but I liked her. No fluff. She moves at quite a pace. For false-beginners, would have bene nice to ave had access to the Chinese vocabulary during the course not at the end. Looking forward to the next course.",4
69672,"Very solid content, with distinct sections and themes. No writing makes it into a good introductory course but also is something more serious learners need to study on their own alongside the course.",4
69676,I found very interesting and useful this course. All modules are nicely designed and framed in relation to learner prospective.,4
69679,"short modules, focused quizzes,",4
69680,You should put chinese characters for a better understanding of this beautiful language.,4
69682,Great Course and teaching style,4
69686,Nice one.. Helped a beginners like me a lot.. I found confidence in myself. Hats off! Simply explained.. xiexie :),4
69691,"I think any course of Chinese must include characters. To teach only a too basic sentences in pinyin is not a good experience. Nonetheless, I like this course.",4
69694,Only teaches pinyin but it's suitable instruction for beginners who just want to learn how to construct some very basic sentences and dialogues. All in Mandarin.,4
69696,A good course to begin with Chinese,4
69697,It's easy to understand and so useful. I met a chinese girl and now we talk together. I hope will be another one in the future to continue learning this beautiful language.,4
69701,"The course is a very practical approach to the language. The main goal of it being to help you get by in the country. It's title should be Surviving in China 101. Although misleading for people wanting to learn the language to an extensive level, it's definitely a good base to have and to build on. The material is presented in a very accessible manner and the quizzes help you master the key elements acquired within each session. Overall, great class if you plan visiting the country and want to be able to get by without a translator as we all know that not all Chinese natives speak English.",4
69710,Good as a standard introduction to chinese. We learnt similar words in our first-semester course at uni.I'd personally also like to learn the simplified chinese symbols but that's just my opinion.Weekly deadlines are good but if we keep going I won't revise anything. I'd rather have the course force me to repeat some of the words and constructs I have learnt in former courses. The assignments should be harder too.,4
69711,I've been learning Chinese for 3 years and this is a great course whether to learn from scratch or to review the basics. I think it should also focus on learning or at least showing the correspondent Chinese characters so that the course could be even better.,4
69718,Excellent and well paced,4
69720,This course is enjoyable and easy to learn from. A minor drawback is that some pictures are difficult to distinguish in the exercises.,4
69727,This class is awesome! I wish that there were some written notes or something to help but the videos are awesome to help with pronunciation.,4
69733,"Ni Hao,I liked the course, good course content though the first week which includes the tones was tough as it is hard to memorize the same. But as English phrase says, ""try try till you succeed""or keeping trying till you succeed.So we have to keep trying the tones till we succeed.Would like to thank the Professor for the video lectures.XieXie",4
69734,"I wish there was more character emphasis, but not bad! Nice and refreshing.",4
69738,"Haven enrolled in this short online course in Chinese for Beginners has really helped me. Now a Masters student at BNU, it's easy for me to communicate on campus and even outside campus. It makes it easier for a native to give you help since you can say something in Chinese. I am amazingly thrilled with my ease of lifestyle in Beijing; thanks to COURSERA",4
69740,Funny learning for beginers :),4
69744,"Excellent chunking of the material, while integrating daily conversational dialogues. Review and quizzes at the end of each section is great. However, I would suggest adding the Chinese characters to the bottom of the pinyin for future Chinese students.",4
69746,I thought the class was very well done as an introductory class. Although I thought there would be an introduction to characters also. I liked the laoshi and the slides. :),4
69750,It is very interesting!! I love it!!,4
69757,Pretty cool. Requires good listening skills and attention skills and ver well detailed.,4
69763,Missing chinese writing,4
69766,I need the writing part,4
69767,"This course includes major topics of daily life. After having completed all lessons with Professor Xiaoyu Liu, the student will be able to express himself/herself in many useful situations. This fast result of some basic Chinese is very motiviating to complete the course and to continue studying this fascinating language. The only drawback may be the lack of some corresponding Chinese characters. However, this may exceed the scope of this Coursera course. Maybe there will be a course Chinese for Beginners 2 in future. If so, I would certainly participate.",4
69783,It has a way better pace,4
69784,Simple and nice!!,4
69785,This was a good intro class. Would be nice to have an intermediate class.,4
69794,very useful.,4
69795,Course material is very useful for true beginners. The course helps a lot to overcome potential fears to failure. Xièxi,4
69805,Better to add characters,4
69815,"I really like the course, all the information presentent.I think it can be better if there was some test, because sometimes it gets too easy.",4
69824,"A profound analysis of the Civil Rights Movement, told from the perspective of an active participant.",4
69833,Learned a lot of new things in this course. Very inspiring.,4
69850,Excellent course. I learned a lot of things,4
69861,"This course covers a lot of material, but unfortunately lacks depth and thorough examples in many areas. It could also use more hands-on activities. Overall, I learned quite a bit and found it was worth the time and effort.",4
69862,The entire course is an overview! This course will be a revision if you already know the concepts.,4
69872,good course material!,4
69881,Great Course but the assigment don't show the understanding of the course,4
69884,"More dynamic visualisation please, and it will be 5*.",4
69885,Very interesting course. It would be useful to download slide used during videos.,4
69886,"Excellent crash course in machine learning and introduction to the kaggle data science competitions. However, the grading system had bugs and was unable to accept two answers as correct making it very frustrating. The grader was finally fixed so next round of this course should be a better experience.",4
69888,"A nice and informative course. The only negative side were the problems with the automatic evaluation of the R assignment. In my opinion, the question should have been automatically removed and/or all submittions reevaluated, or all students should have been notified about the need for manual resubmission. As it was, some (like myself) were left with fewer points that they should have received just because they did not check the discussion forums every day (mainly because of other obligations).",4
69897,"Good review of basic Korean dialogues. Handy if you've ever taken a course before, but I mostly used it as a review. There was a bunch of stuff I had forgotten, but almost nothing new compared to my first semester at Sogang University. Still, a good course, and I hope they do some more advanced ones. I would appreciate some speaking assignments on top of the quizzes.",4
69905,"I'm enjoy this program, learn korean become more fun",4
69915,I agree that my feedback may be viewed by the Coursera community,4
69923,"instructive, well paced. some of the exercises are a bit too far off from the lessons as they introduce new vocabulary. Very good overall",4
69924,I really like this course. I took the previous one and it helped me so much! I really love how you all teach. Please do bring a level 2 or something. Amazing work!! Hwaiting!,4
69937,"That was amazing journey, but why I rated the course with 4 starts instead of 5?1) To choose foreign students as an assistants to wonderful Sang Mee Han sonsengnim - good idea for those who aren't comfortable to see first class Korean students with 100% fluent pronunciation - bad idea to those who want to hear fluency to learn how to pronounce words correctly, not...2) The course is right for people who want to visit Korea in the next month, it's like the lessons were built upon the idea that the visitors have to go the store to buy something, and to go to the restaurants to eat and spend as much money as one person could possibly waste, because they had to use what they had learned. You'll learn only that in this course, in general. What to buy, order.3) Korea is a high-tech country, and to take the students outside - good idea to see the buildings, nature, and to get some fresh air - bad idea to see how foreign students still misspell very basic words and phrases, and the sound quality is just awful. And it's like the foreign students have no idea about the tone of such a beautiful language, and it's like they are just saying what they had learned by heart before to record the video. As artists - the same.4) Additional materials are amazing! Thanks for such a great compilation of workbook with what we learned in each lesson. Painful to download and try to find the right lecture materials as the file names are just automatically generated by computer letters and digits. Sure, we could rename each files' name separately by hand - but it has always been easy to download files that ready to go and most importantly - find.P.S. I'm very grateful to watch the lessons from wonderful Sang Mee Han - she is a great person I believe. For the next time, as I hope there will be second course titles as ""Learn To Speak Korean 2"", there will be native speakers with native pronunciation and with good audio quality recorded with professional artists. Sounds impossible, but Korea such a country that will make it possible.",4
69976,Excellent course to understand the theory behind the applications of Robot motions! Loved this course! :),4
69981,It is a good course. The teacher is amazing. The teacher theaches us a lot about control.,4
69983,Very interesting course. It pays to have some control theory and matlab background,4
69995,"pretty good course,gave me a good kick start into the robot control field and also on how to proceed further into it.",4
70001,"I really enjoyed the course, but wish there was still support for the optional construction and programming your own robot.",4
70017,A good course that specifically teaches about Mobile Robots. Along with the course a control theory textbook will be very useful.,4
70020,really good material with explanations for everybody; great control concepts made easy and practical; it is very important to have conceptual bases and this course gives it. Thanks to Professor and his crew! =),4
70021,"Excellent material. It could have been better if the tracking problem had more examples showing practical application. For example, I struggled to apply the control theoretic material from this course to Penn's Aerial Robotics course. Also, it wasn't crystal clear how to compose PID regulator from the ""systematic"" approach. This being said, I enjoyed the course and learned a lot.",4
70025,"Very good review of mobile robots and control theory in regard to them. Fairly limited to movement of terrestrial robots using wheels, but provides foundational mathematics applicable to other designs. The MATLAB simulation examples allow you to build your own algorithms to test out the concepts.",4
70027,Really great course for robot enthusiasts or anyone wishing to pursue robotics.,4
70044,great course I learnt a lot ... I wish to attend another course for the same professor and the great team of instructors,4
70059,very Good so far,4
70060,"I love this course. It's useful, and really interesting!Smithri Chopra is so kind and cute.",4
70071,"It was great to learn the course with a simple quiz within the video presentation, it helps us to understand the material clearly. Despite the new unfamiliar terms so sometimes I need to open my note back, but Ms. Bicchieri explanation using flow chart really helped me. This is very interesting yet important for my work in the development program, thank you.",4
70072,It's really very useful curse. Thanks for taking me in this course.,4
70078,"I don't work in social field or anything that has to do with UNICEF, but despite that, I find this course greatly interesting and what I received from it surprisingly exceeded my initial expectations. I find the knowledge from this course useful not only for social workers, but also for community-oriented researchers, or anyone who would like to understand or make a change in a community. Most of this course is an introduction to technical terms, gradually introducing us how to look at certain behaviours of people in any communities, helping us know what such behaviours are made of and how we should start in order to make a change to it. Things I find especially interesting are actually in the last week of the lecture, where the professor had introduced to me tips and tricks for measuring outcomes and making surveys that could actually get quality information - something I never knew how to do and had never expected to know and realise that it would matter so much.As for the downside, it may be either because I am not familiar with terms in the social and humanity fields or because English is not my mother language, but I find that the professor sometimes uses words too sophisticated, when in reality I thought it would be better if she could have used simpler terms and vocabularies both in the video and the readings - sometimes I find myself becoming confused by her excess uses of fancy words and stretching something that could be briefly explained too much for my liking. Sometimes I even get to finally understand what she meant in the parts where there are examples, which is one of the things I like about the course, too.Overall, this course was an eye opener for me. I had a very pleasant time learning and am already enrolling for the second course!",4
70083,"Very nice and informative, and practically useful! Thanks Cristina",4
70084,"The course is very detailed, with a strong methology and useful examples. Nevertheless, it wasn't always simple to follow and the last week was very demanding.",4
70091,"I enroll the course just for listening videos and following the readings,I really enjoyed it, and learned it, it gives another perspective to see the whole communitythanks a lot",4
70096,"This is one of the most interesting and interacting course, makes you not to move from your chair. The course prepares the participants to understand the simpler issues in a broader way and serious issues in a simple and straightforward way.",4
70100,It was a good course even though it was a bit theoretical. Its a great start for someone who has no background in social norms. I am glad I took this course though,4
70102,"It's very useful. I think at first lectures there is neccesary a synopsis about the concepts and their classification or relation, because as you deep the relation is more confused.",4
70108,"It was a great course. In the first to weeks the concepts were not so clear, but after this, the lessons became more clear and everything fit. It gave me really good insights. I look forward for social norms, social change II. Hope it come soon.",4
70125,"This course truly opened my eyes on the importance of revision, I recommend this course not only for budding poets but even for those who have never attempted poetry. You will learn a great deal.",4
70141,"Very interesting course; the only issue I had was with the students grading each other's poems. I would have preferred the teacher or the mentors to be grading them since they are presumably well versed with the art of poetry and the various techniques involved in their creation. While the grading process might enhance the learning of the students, it should not come at the cost of one's grades due to the obvious limitations or biases of the student graders.",4
70162,very informative course.,4
70164,"i find this course highly helpful to learn new aspects of poetry, embrace new thoughts and new ideas to write upon.",4
70165,Very fun instructor.The peer review as a workshop is perfect.I just wish that there are more poems to study and that it's longer or it has a continuation.,4
70166,It is a riveting,4
70173,"The course itself is amazing. I learned so much. I used to only write prose poetry and thanks to this course I was able to write different forms. Besides the mentors' give such great comments and they are always eager to help. Also the professor is funny and choose really good poems to analyse.The only thing that was a pity is that people post their work, but few people want to actively comment on other people's poetry. It is not as participative as it could be. However, some workshops to comment to get comments.All in all, truly amazing course!",4
70177,"I enjoyed the ideas, but the peer feedback was less than helpful.",4
70180,"Course was great with very nice prompts.The only issue I had was with scoring. Since this was mainly a workshop more emphasis should've been given to feedback of an assignment rather than scoring points. Sometimes readers of a poem might not be able to grasp what the author intended and cause the student to fail the assignment,",4
70207,"I really enjoyed this course. Although I wish there had been more practices to instill the firm knowledge of what the content was. Computer flashcards, or even extra little quizzes in each lesson would have been nice. Other than that, great course, great teacher, and great content! Thank you!",4
70208,Overall felt it to be an excellent course. A refresher in some areas and mind expander in others. Has been decades since taxing my brain so. Had a few browser issues but it all worked out. Some of the prompts were interesting and quite a challenge. Compliments to the chefs...,4
70212,"fantastic course - only slight issues are quizzes that seek to trick you on the way they are worded rather than actual knowledge, and slight america-centric-ness of the material used (although all material was still fantastic, an example or two from non western poets might have been interesting to add)",4
70215,"A fun and engaging experience, excellent writing prompts. The kind of on-line educational experience I appreciate- encouraging and supportive, yet completely unwilling to take itself too seriously. The on-line poetry workshop experience with peers can be hit or miss, but even so, I gained some unexpected insights into my writing. Well worth enrolling and completing.",4
70224,Peer reviews can be a gamble. But the professor is excellent. Helpful to get started with poetry or get over writer's block.,4
70225,Very interesting and thought provoking. I found the instructor amusing.,4
70228,Loved the short but sharp classes! Thank you! Would love to see more peer reviews (didn't get any on my poems yet).Best of luck!Katya,4
70230,I am finding it really interesting and helpful. :),4
70242,"Early days yet but I've seen enough to realise it is interesting, intense, funny, persuasive, stimulating and creative. Thank you Douglas.",4
70244,"Very nice course, with interesting material, taught in a witty and engaging manner, and pretty good prompts. I had a very nice experience!",4
70254,Gently entertaining introduction to writing poetry with some good examples and advice.,4
70262,Great teacher and great content BUT I just wish that it would have been more abundant with information. it seemed for times maybe too short.,4
70265,"Very good content, good sources. Unfortunately the sound is poor, which is the only thing preventing me to grade this mooc 5",4
70269,Very good course! The only problem for me was the poor quality of the sound.,4
70272,Great contents! It is very well developed by new additional resources and links comparing to last year. Thanks Coursera!,4
70276,"I respect the fact the lectures contain a lot of references to the outside world, e.g. goes beyond the academia.",4
70285,Practical insight to empower entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skil,4
70291,The course summarized the key concepts that an entrepreneur will need to become familiar with in order to survive in the competitive startup environment. The text-book and recommended extra readings were very useful in order to complement the material.,4
70307,Good course. Lectures clear and concise. Programming exercises interesting and challenging.,4
70310,"A good course. The user of unfolding maps makes it a little confusing at times, but on the positive side it provides and example that could be of practical use when creating programs in future.",4
70317,"very nice introduction to classes, subclasses and iterfaces. The final project took me a serious effort but i think this is all about commitment. i got stucked for few days but when you find the solution to your problem is a very addictive sensetion",4
70318,"The core content of the course is really good. On the downside, there is, in my opinion, too big a focus on the unfolding map mod. I would have preferred to code objects from scratch.",4
70320,Must have if you begin to learn java.,4
70325,wonderful experience with coursera,4
70335,"nice course, for the future I suggest to add more assignments.",4
70342,This course has been well put together with sufficient number of exercises to get started on OOP in Java.,4
70346,Very good Course. Best explanations through good examples. If assignments were programming rather than objective it would have been much better.,4
70347,Nice Course!At least make the assessment of graded materials available to auditors!,4
70353,5 stars for teachers.4 stars for the TA/mentor.They only answer the technical questions like setting up the environment but seldom answer the question about understanding the program.So you need to figure out all the new problems by yourself alone and can not get help.Sometimes it's a waste of time.,4
70376,"Course was great, learned so much! Audio levels on the videos was a tad quiet.",4
70377,"The material is explained really well, and there are many concepts that are introduced that it helps set a good foundation in OOP. The project is pre-built which is the only thing that I didn't enjoy a lot, I would have preferred starting everything from scratch as I think it would help cement the stuff learnt even more.",4
70378,Good cool course,4
70383,Great course,4
70385,Amazing course with very useful contents and hands on.,4
70389,Thanks a lot!Please keep up the good work.,4
70392,I am very satisfied with the course.it was nice.,4
70393,"Very interesting. The lessons are clear, engaging and concise . I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to improve their programming skills.",4
70398,It's very useful coursebut if it was dealing with java built in classes it would be better to be a start course in specialization,4
70403,very good overview of the fundamental concepts of Java,4
70408,"The course comes with great explanation but the graded assignments sometimes seem pointless as they look irrelevant to the topic, There are unnecessary questions asked in quizzes i.e whether you have completed your assignment or not. These sort of questions never evaluate what we have accomplished",4
70412,"I liked the ""How I struggled"" and ""Challenge"" videos. The course itself was challenging to me and I learned a few object oriented programming concepts that can help me at work.",4
70439,Good.Project need to be has less dependency considering the offline users and limited machine capability.,4
70442,"Nice course, to starting with java.",4
70443,awsome course,4
70450,"It was really cool. I have been working as a Full stack developer in java since 2014, but I learnt and understood core concept very well. Thank You for these sessions.",4
70451,A good course and beautiful lectures. But the programming assignments should be little more tough.,4
70452,Excellent Professors the way the concepts were delivered was superb got the chance to learn alot.,4
70455,"This is a solid course. The videos are a bit low quality, and the API's used are sorta derpy, but the content is good.",4
70457,"When I signed up for this course I had already taken a year's worth of Java classes and was quite well prepared. My overall opinion of the course is that it was really good and the instructors did a good job by presenting clear videos of some beginning - intermediate level concepts. I especially liked Christine's and Mia's presentations. The videos on memory models were really great and helped me a lot. The assignments were really interesting too as they collected and mapped real time data of earthquakes onto a map, but some of the external libraries being used in UnfoldingMaps could have been explained a little better as to what their implementations were. In the beginning it was a little confusing trying to figure out the superclasses even though the Javadocs for them were available. I also felt that the Interaction Design Lab in Germany - the folks who implemented the UnfoldingMaps could have made the Javadocs of their classes a little more detailed. Further explanation of how to use the classes built into the course would have been very helpful. Hence the 4/5 stars given. But overall I really enjoyed the class and am really looking forward to the second class in the sequence. Well done!",4
70460,Excellent for basic understanding about the Java language.,4
70466,"Good course, but topics covered are mixed with Java GUI library, Algorithm, OO of Java language. It would be good if this course can focus on OO feature of Java only.",4
70472,If I could finish exam without fee will be perfect,4
70473,"Great introduction to Java. Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start, rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses, which is really cool. No peer review, just quiz questions that can only be answered if the assignment is completed correctly. The assignments are therefore not particularly challenging -- you get out of this class what you put in!",4
70478,Very good course. Much more challenging than I expected. Definitely helped me become a better programmer.,4
70498,I have been following this course since mid 2015 and I found it very good. But because of my busy schedule I usually switch the session. But this time I am really motivated to devote some time for this great course to learn OOP. I have learned a lot in my university about java programming but they did not teach us these stuff which are practiced. we solved a lot of problems there but they had nothing much about using java libraries and OOP. Thanks all the lecturers from UCSD and Coursera for such a great course.,4
70509,"Good beginner content, touches on some good foundations for java",4
70510,I had some difficulty with English (I am not a native speaker): in some lessons it comes quickly and then you need the use of subtitles. I also studied some concepts with the use of Java manuals.,4
70523,It's a wonderful course. Covers all the basic concepts of OOP and provides the knowledge to develop an interesting and interactive application.The instructors have a student friendly teaching technique .This has helped me a lot. Thanks to the staff of UCSD and coursera.,4
70527,very nice course and assignments,4
70537,Nice Java-centric introduction to OOP!,4
70542,Overall I enjoyed this course and learned quite a bit.,4
70543,"A great practical overview of java as a programming language. I have always learnt it in bits and pieces, so it was nice to be introduced various features of the language as well as objected oriented programming to address the growing complexity of a project.",4
70544,"Quite basic and sometimes a little slow for coders with some experience, but well-structured and very interesting.",4
70546,Not a five star review because this course is more like an introduction to programming on Java and best fit for a beginners. So that said this course is more about programming tools and project setup than a programming at all.,4
70554,"Good course, but a few loose ends that could be tightened up. Definitely helped with my rusty java skills.",4
70562,"This is definitely one of the best courses I have taken. The presentations, resources, and projects are very creative and well designed. The ""what do you want to cover next"" quizzes tempt you to try things on your own before looking for help, which is a nice teaser. The only reason I give it 4/5 is that a few of the project instructions were too vague to figure out what they were asking for (i.e. without asking).",4
70586,"It's a relatively short and easy course, but it has good lecture videos and programming assignments.Also, I think that you would have to already have fairly good computer programming skills (either in Java or some other language) to take this course, because it pretty much jumps right into adding complex functionality to existing programs to extend their behavior.",4
70587,"Good course, ideal for the first half of a second course in computer science. A little java experience is recommended buy you'll probably be ok if you have program in a statically type programming language before because you can pick up java very quickly. The lectures are very good, I think that the teachers are excellent expositors but I feel that they could be more detailed. The project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity. Finally you need to add your own extension which I found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new things.The only cons of the course for me is the way assignments are evaluated. I think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive. You have to answers questions in a Quiz related to the week content and the project. But the are not very demanding, therefore they do not reflect how much you really know.In general I recommend taking this course if you are in self study journey in computer science, even more the specialization start to get more interesting and demanding in the follow up courses, more complete and detailed.",4
70589,Nice Course I like the way of providing resources and support forum.,4
70596,"After almost finish this section, find that the most thing I have done is stuck on Casting and solve this problem (It takes 2 hours frustration + 30 minutes the rest).",4
70599,A very well constructed materials provide deep understanding of the OOP core concepts.Do not hesitate enrolling.,4
70601,I learned quite a lot and the course work was easy to follow and build knowledge from lesson to lesson. I enjoyed the projects as well.,4
70602,Very great job. It should recommend a bibliography though.,4
70605,Sometimes the person who is speaking it doesnt inderstand very wellSome exercises it doesnt understand very welltheyll asume you yave more experience that they wanted for this course.I think it would be if they give more examples and exercise for the assigmentsregards,4
70606,Excellent course! very challenging class,4
70613,Great Course :),4
70619,"The only complaint I have about this course is the horribly irritating music at the beginning of each lecture video. I would have my headphones in, volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly, then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly. If I was very quick I could mute my volume until it finished, but I think this is totally unnecessary. PLEASE consider changing this, as it will affect my decision to pursue further courses in this specialization",4
70622,A little more about interfaces and abstract classes should be added to understand the concepts better,4
70633,"Coursera gives Universities the flexibility to show their own style of teaching and sharing knowledge.I really love this course, good project.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However, good course is not only the instructor's' responsibility, but also the students' active involvement.I rate 4 because we need more students get involved in developing this course like creating wiki notes.Extra material to read etc.",4
70649,It could provide deeper concepts with more examples.,4
70651,"Its been a productive journey since my concepts about OOPS are crystal clear. I would surely enroll in more courses provided by UC,San Diego.",4
70657,Core concepts of OOP are explained very well in this course. Assignments were quite practical in nature and implementing them was challenging and fun. I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to strengthen and formalize their knowledge of OOP concepts.I wish assignments would be submitted for code review and students would be able to get more specific input from mentors on code organization and style. Integrating with github would be a great step forward towards transparency as well.,4
70659,"I learned many useful things in this class. The concepts were explained very well, and the assignments were challenging. However, I do wish the assignments required submission (I realize this was implemented in the second course).",4
70662,Well organized and designed.,4
70668,Well taken by the teachers. The bugs in the review system are the only problems I faced.Hope they get rectified soon.,4
70697,"It is very useful, especially the example framework they have with the maps and worldbank data",4
70704,"Very crisp explanations. Treatment on polymorphism was very good. The only thing I did not like was that we were forced to cast a few times during our assignments, and usually this is not a good practice to be taught to someone.",4
70706,I am learning from this course and thats far more better,4
70707,Well structured content and great explanation on concepts. I really like the concept challenge portion as it helps dig into the application of the concepts explained in the lecture. It would have been better if the lecture slides were available in pdfs.,4
70708,"Great intro to polymorphism, casting classes, sorting and datastructures",4
70718,"I learnt some good tricks on this course, it came at the this time for what I was doing at work. I recommend this course as it covers most of the basics, and encapsulated difficult parts, all you do call a method to do something.",4
70720,"Its a good course to take. As we learn OOP in a better understandable way. Instructors explain the concepts well. Also I always like working with maps and as this course assignments are based on map data, plotting data on real maps it like it more. But it would be great if the course have taught to execute the same code through java jar. As using Papplet via eclipse is easy but how to use the same code via computer terminal is quite tricky as we don't find any main method in our code.",4
70722,Well done MOOC. Material was very clearly presented by excellent instructors.,4
70730,Good explanations and fun project.,4
70731,Interesting course to achieve.,4
70739,"Good course, but the project of map isn't so clear.",4
70745,Good course with it i better understand the java structure.,4
70756,"Although I agree that the mapping library that is used for the programming assignments adds something visually interesting to the course, I felt that it added an unnecessary level complexity when it came understanding the object-oriented aspects of the language. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use a library that I won't likely use again just to be able to apply the core programming concepts being taught in that lesson. Having said this, I felt a good sense of accomplishment after getting through the final project.",4
70758,Was great I enjoyed the whole project working with processing applets,4
70759,Perfect for beginner/novice programmer who want's to take the next step.,4
70763,"Good, well paced course. Big advantage is the short duration of the video-lectures. I prefer a few short ones over one long lecture.",4
70767,good interaction,4
70772,Liked the way Prof. has so far taught this course.,4
70779,For all who want to understand object-oriented programming this is the course that should be taken.,4
70788,mainly work with applets.,4
70789,"Some of the questions are not Java related ones at all which I couldn't see much of a helping point, e,g. What are the coordinates of rio de janeiro?. There were also a few of questions that I found a bit confusing because the code provided is plain white and it's a bit hard to focus on it. I'd rather want to customize the color of the presented code just like modern IDEs do. Everything else seems rather okay and intuitive. So far so good, guys :)",4
70797,Nicely explained and neat,4
70814,"It was a good, brief session that provided basic information on presentations.",4
70827,Good background and enjoyed delving into the detail of the Middle East.,4
70831,"Very well made course, although I wish to see more on other countries, because Egipt, Israel and Palestine were making most of lectures.",4
70842,"This course is wonderful, and does not seem biased. My one complaint is that for so so much information, there are only two quizzes. I would prefer to have a test at the end of each weekly lesson, especially since the quizzes are so short. The material and videos themselves are wonderful! I learned a lot :)",4
70850,"I quite appreciate the teaching of American philosophers, like Emerson or Rorty.",4
70892,Great course,4
70901,It's quite a step up from the level op IPP. Assignments are also a bit more difficult but still very enjoyable puzzles to solve.,4
70902,"I started this course straight after finishing IIPP1 and IIPP2 (both of which I loved). I had no coding experience before those two courses but managed to work hard and got through them so kept on straightaway with PoC1. This was a mistake on my part. For me, there was a quite a step up and early on I was getting out of my depth and actually in the end did not finish the course. In hindsight (and actually what I am doing down to re-enroll) I would go and gain much more experience of Classes (they play a major part, and I am thinking or writing all the games as classes that I built in IIPP) and work through the Math Preparation to prepare. I'm giving the course 4 stars because the material, the lectures and the learning is great but I found the amount I was expected to do each week was well beyond my expectations of an MOOC and more than the two modules before.",4
70903,Great course ! Some assignments were not that easy and required time to be achieved. Enjoyed it !,4
70906,Nice course. Ready to apply data.,4
70907,"Overall, a very good course. Not without its flaws (inconsistent video audio levels), but I have walked away knowing far more about Genomic Data Science than I expected to.",4
70922,"This course is very well done made. Again, I enjoyed the teaching of Mr. Wayne Whiteman very much.",4
70925,"The Course material is great and is useful to refresh the concepts underlying dynamics of 3D motion in a short span of time. The course is very well structured and enjoyed thoroughly listening to the lectures by Dr. Whiteman. I have just one complaint though, model answers to the question in quiz are not available. So, it is difficult to compare the approach taken and validate the understanding.",4
70926,Nice course and awesome videos....Really loved it but some parts could have been simpler.,4
70940,"wonderful course, systematically cover the flow chart of the O&Gd industrial, with analysis of details !!!! basically the course make me procure a whole picture of this industrial and specific rules underlying in it.But the it maybe dull a little bit if you are not interested in this topic.",4
70943,"Great Course!I would prefer if it contains more demonstrative slides and reading materials, so it would be easier to absorb these interesting information.",4
70946,"it's an interesting overview of the oil and gas industry and market. I'd have appreciated if it was longer than it is. Maybe, if they add another chapter about the economy it'd be better.",4
70948,Course goes through basics of Upstream Midstream and Downstream oil and gas industries also its Markets.,4
70951,it is an amazing course.you should really take it.it provides you with the needed knowledge fundamentals in oil and gas industry.,4
70952,The course content is very good but the professor is not charismatic and in overall it is not well produced as other courses i´ve taken,4
70956,It was awonderfull learning jeorney,4
70957,"Very good course, help me to complement my learning in English",4
70960,i hope i can get scholarship and get a better job after complete this course,4
70961,"Excellent course, leaned the Nuances of Oil and gas operation and Markets.",4
70987,The Course was good and clear at it's first part. The second was little below it.,4
70998,Worth spending 2 weeks to get the basic insights of the Oil and Gas industry and cost trends,4
71000,Excellent course to acquaint with Oil and Gas Industry.,4
71002,Great course to understand the oil and gas industry.,4
71005,Great course for beginners into the Oil and Gas Market. Enjoyed learning from Mr. Lincoln. Would love advanced courses of the same topic! Cheers!,4
71007,Sometimes the efforts of others makes life easier for us than th,4
71014,It is a good course for any one interested in the field of oil & gas industry and all the processes associated with them.,4
71017,Information provided is enough for introduction. I was expected something more detailed information about cost and commercial part.,4
71018,"Very detailed yet covers alot of subject matter. Professor is precise and detailed about each topic, while giving good examples. I would recommend this course to any person wishing to get a good snapshot of the Energy Sector and wishing to make a career with any number of direct or indirect companies involved in this industry.",4
71021,"it's a good start for those who interested in this field , and an excellent review for petrol Engs and geoscientists",4
71025,"Very good course, but not much of emphasis was out on downsteam and industrail products",4
71026,"sir, this is very informative.",4
71027,"Brief informative course on the industry, especially helpful for people outside the oil and gas industry or students.",4
71029,This course is very important for my expirience and my job.,4
71043,"This course is very good, but subject sequence, presentation design and user interaction could improve.",4
71048,Extremely hard. I took my time with this course. Please have some experience with Scala before you take this class. This is not an introduction to Scala. For all you that say it is....you are pissed off and bitter. This class is for those who have experience in the language.,4
71051,good class. I did learn a lot.,4
71054,"The course is generally very good and met most of my learning objectives, but some of the assignments, particularly the last assignment, are more difficult than I would expect for an introduction to functional programming.",4
71072,"Excellent, still maybe, not enough teacher - students interactions for person who paid for the course. (in forums etc...).",4
71075,The learning curve is a bit steep,4
71081,"Great course! This is my first time that I have finished course in coursera. The assignment is intersting and challenging. By studying the course and coding the assignment, I learn a little about functional programming. Howerver, I'm still confused about what the advantage of functional programming is and how to use function programming in project. I hope the next course can figure me out.",4
71109,"A word from old time programmer: More basics, fewer complex problems.More stress onto the language constructs, control structures, functions, control abstraction ... rather than .. figuring out algorithms without having basic understanding how things can be done in Scala.",4
71111,"It was good fun to complete it but some of the assignments did take more than 3 hours, more like between 4 and 5 hours",4
71119,pure functional approach to solve problems.,4
71134,"Not a gentle introduction. Often guilty of appropriating cool programming concepts for its own pedagogy, which often simply dilutes the core principles. Despite that - a generally well-structured course with thought-out (and challenging!) assignments.",4
71148,homework requires lost of effort and generally is not covered in lectures,4
71149,Scala from the source! Great way to get a great introduction to the language and how it is best applied to problems,4
71151,Not all examples are right,4
71156,I took more than 12 hours to finish the assignment for week 4. The estimate (3h) is likely to be wrong.,4
71157,"Loved the course. Got to learn from basic the concepts of functional programming languages.Good pace. Awesome level of assignments. Had to good time thinking the solution of the assignments.Great way to learn a new language, thanks to the instructor.",4
71168,This course was great for developing new brain connections. It was sometimes frustrating - In particular with the very limited discussion threads available on the forum (I wonder if it would be possible to merge forum threads between some runs...). But it was great introduction to get the brain started with functional programming and related Scala syntax.,4
71171,"This course was a big challenge for me. It was such an opportunity to recall the Scala I had studied over the past year and try it out.This course is never easy. This is an intermediate course, and the topic is Scala because it is difficult to get a running curve. In addition, the intermediate evaluation problems of considerable difficulty are really difficult. Unless you are familiar with functional programming, folding, and reducing, this is a difficult problem to solve. So it would be difficult to give five stars.I'm very happy to finish all the assignments and complete this course, but I plan to see one more time later.",4
71176,"It's more focus on the functional programming rather Scala programming language itself, but nevertheless it's fascinate to switch the mindset from one to another and think about the a totally different perspectives.",4
71177,Good Course! Helps to get the basic concept of Functional Programming.,4
71183,Good course for learning functional paradigm coupled with object oriented concept. Very well planned course. It is definitely a great learning opportunity.Thanks,4
71193,This i believe is a very good introduction into Functional programming. This course was a lot harder to what I initially expected. If you are used to languages like Java or C# you have to completely rethink the way you are used to approach problems. I had to do a lot more extra work and reading and do extra examples to understand some of the new concepts - but it is worth the effort.,4
71201,Well executed. The only difficulty that I had was when my assignments were not functioning well and had a hard time to understand what was wrong. A 10-minute video on tips on how to debug efficiently would have been great.,4
71202,"Introduces Scala syntax elements and concepts systematically and logically (functions, objects,classes, lists, collections, including syntactic sugar).If you already know another functional language, you will immediately recognize equivalences (e.g. instead of sum types you have subtyping with case classes, the type of recursive functions needs to be defined, etc.), and can complete the course in a matter of days.",4
71203,"Fascinating course. I've been studying scala with book and internet before I found this course. During that time I felt something not enough to get into scala programming. Because I can't really feel what is functional programming is. Now, after finish it, I think I can say what it is. It's broad my sight in programming world.It was very helpful course. Thank you!",4
71216,"Wish they didn't restructure the old classes, now it offers less of the interesting material. Fantastic course nonetheless, highly recommended.",4
71220,A fantastic introduction to Scala Programming from the creator of Scala. The assignments are well designed and really test your grasp of the concepts. A good learning experience from an astounding professor.,4
71233,"In general is very good, but the assignments are sometimes extremely difficult. Also, assignments have questions that are ahead of the current week, they as things that were not included in the lectures, so you need to watch the lectures of the one week ahead to be able to understand them",4
71234,Thank you! I learned a lot.,4
71243,Great teacher. With some issues. I found a little bit confusing the first week installing instructions with lots of data. But it improves.Exercises are surprisingly elegant. Not easy but once you with the functional way of doing it simple.,4
71245,"A good introduction by the creator of Scala himself. However I feel that this course is a condensed version of a longer course, so that is why I give 4/5 and not 5/5.",4
71248,Heavy lecture material. Programming assignments require some work or preset knowledge of functional programming to succesfully complite.,4
71261,It could have been better if there were more unit tests.,4
71270,"Excellent introduction to Scala and the principles of functional programming, with lots of challenging and enjoyable exercises. My only minor complaint is the some of the exercises require knowledge that has not yet been covered in the course. However, it could be argued that this encourages active research by the students, which isn't necessarily a bad thing!",4
71271,"Lots of practical examples. Good links to more info on the web. Interesting mix of programming theory and practical learning of Scala.It would have been interesting with some applications of functional programming that were less mathematical. Can it be as useful in more data-oriented, administrative systems?The estimated time needed to complete each week was very low. I had to spend at least two or three times as much time as estimated even though I am accustomed to Java and all the tools used.",4
71274,"Great introduction to functional programming, and you'll get to learn the basics of Scala at the same time. Some of the assignments have a bit cryptic descriptions.",4
71277,"The course was good exercise, and Martin does a very thorough job of covering the topics of the course. I do wish the course focused a bit more on the assignment problems. There were some interesting problems to work on, and I don't think the discussion forums are a very helpful way of covering those topics.",4
71302,"I really enjoyed completing challenges, but videos were a bit too theoretical for my taste.",4
71303,Great Course to be familiar with the functional programming principles. Missing a little bit more solved examples and some more fundamental materail,4
71307,"Nice course, hometasks are about medium level difficulty (in hackerrank terms). Problems are already half-completed, so you're just filling the gaps following the design. That really shows the power of scala in things like pattern matching (suddenly, it's everywhere!) and functional programming approach (lots of small functions with pretty narrow scopes). So althouth you can program just as if it was java, you're kinda pushed to do scala.Thanks for the course.",4
71311,This course really helped me to understand the basics of SCALA. I really enjoyed the challenges of this course.,4
71315,"I like this course. It can help me about practise programing scala easily. In here, I can learn scala programming quickly with support everyone.",4
71328,"Excellent intro course, but not without issues.In general, pro's include reasonable length lectures, provided by _the_ leading expert in the field, and designer of the Scala language. Focus on functional programming techniques versus syntax nuance is a significant benefit - Scala is easy to get bogged down in. Pro's also include the fact that lectures have had at least some amount of post-production work done, and manage to make voiceover/slides/whiteboard consistent and coherent better than most similar online classes/tutorials.The assignments are reasonable, and the time estimates of ~3 hrs each was about right on the average, at least in my case (senior programmer with deep background in C/C++, and just enough Java to be dangerous and dislike boilerplate).Some drawbacks - there was no clear segue from ""basic syntax"" to ""collections framework"". That's _IMPORTANT_. In 20/20 hindsight, I would have benefitted from a big, bold slide before the first mention of ""foreach"" that said ""stop here, go to the text, and skim the chapters on collections for 'foreach' and other common operations. This is a building block for everything to follow, and NOT unique to just lists.""The major factor keeping this from being a '5' in my mind were that the assignments didn't always make sense as written, and I had to go back and forth between the assignment writeup, the source code and the test cases to really sort out what was required. The assignments could become _much_ more effective if they were provided with more test cases, including expected FAILURE cases and not just bare minimal acceptance cases.",4
71339,"the only problem here is the assigments, they are hard and unrelated somehow to the videos",4
71346,"Great course. I wish the prereqs would specify graphs, inductive proofs and other prerequsites from the math domain that were required to understand the examples.Switching to FP and recursive thinking is hard enough as it is - having to combine it with graph algorithms and other concepts, not necessarily familiar for OOP background programmers increases the effort unnecessarily. That being said, good thing the course offered a preview week.",4
71347,"Enjoyable and informative. The assignments were workable, though they were not always super-well coordinated with the course material. The in-lecture exercises are of uneven quality. The course material is obviously spliced together from other sources in places.All this notwithstanding, the lectures are interesting, and the exercises help a lot to cement in the concepts. As an experienced programmer, but a newcomer to functional techniques, this was satisfying. I'm aware that the other courses in this sequence suffer from similar issues to what I outlined, but I'm moving ahead anyway.",4
71350,This course gives a very nice introduction to Functional Programming whilst introducing you to the idiosyncrasies of the Scala language.,4
71352,It's a great course to understand the principles of functional programming.,4
71357,High level course. Exercises are academic of nature. You might need more time to finish the exercises. I appreciate that this is a well formed course.,4
71360,"There are some issues with the course video, but overall great course :)",4
71364,"Good course, learnt quite a lot even as someone with some existing experience of Scala. The exercises were challenging but not too difficult and the estimated completion time is pretty much spot on. Just a shame that the automatic grader and verification systems are less than reliable on some of the exercises.",4
71366,"Tons of math, but I achieved what I was looking for.",4
71374,"This course is a great way to start learning Scala and functional programming. Would have given five stars, but the coding examples were sometimes boring and difficult to take in. I would suggest using smaller examples to present material and making the full coding examples optional.",4
71377,Interesting problems to be solved in a functional way.,4
71380,This course help me learn functional programming.,4
71382,It would be good to have examples that are not too much inclined towards Maths.,4
71385,Content is not updated. Now is 2016.,4
71391,"It's a good course,although it starts a little slowly and then really builds up a lot of steam towards the end. I think it should be paced out to be an 8-week course and include shorter, less ambitious assignments. I personally found that the assignments lead to onerous difficulty unless one actively seeks out different aspects of the language other than what was taught in this course (particularly native list methods), and once that has begun, then the last two weeks of it seem like a long-winded slog.It's nice to be able to learn programming style from Odersky himself. I recommend the text ""Functional Programming in Scala"" to read and work through during the course.",4
71397,"Very helpful course for beginners, and congratulations for putting up such a great work together!But a few suggestions -1) Most importantly, the assignments were very VERY hard for starters in functional programming and Scala. It would be much more enjoyable to many more if it's made a little easier.2) The content was great, but I believe a little more (both in breadth and depth) was needed to be covered. Moreover the categorization can be rethought and a little re-organized.Nevertheless, a great course! Will surely recommend this one.",4
71407,A very good beginners course for learning Scala. The lectures are a bit dry but overall a very good course with good assignments.,4
71411,A good course but it could be better.,4
71416,"I really enjoyed the assignments, and thought they were a good way to get to know the basics of the language. They were similar to the type of ""toy problem"" that I like to do myself when learning another language, and were at a reasonable level of difficulty.I could have done without the proofs; I sort of skipped over these parts (about an hour of lecture, I guess). That's just my preference - I guess I'm not super proofy.There were very minor parts of the course that need updating, but nothing that required additional effort to get past.",4
71418,"The material was fantastic, but the lectures seemed to be a bit basic in comparison to the actual coding assignments. Even after understanding the martial covered in the lectures it felt at times as if the coding assignments were drafted against an entirely unrelated topic (or at least by someone with a completely different approach).",4
71430,The content is great! But the rearrangement of lectures is not synced with intros at the beginning of some videos. I know it takes a lot of time and effort to make or alter a video. After all it doesn't affect much.,4
71431,Covers fundamental theory well and examples and exercises are chosen well to make it practical.,4
71438,Really helped me understand the basic concepts of functional programming and Scala,4
71439,"Great course to learn basics for Scala, but for me too much math related assignments.",4
71445,"Great course about functional programming and Scala.The lectures are well constructed and well explained with some exercises in between. The sound is unfortunately sometimes low, but I used headphones for that.The assignments are challenging and help you deepen your knowledge effectively. However, the forum is not very lively. You might not find it difficult to do assignments on your own. I suggest to use StackOverflow in that case.It is not taught how to do debugging, though this course is not meant for beginners I think, and as such probably understanding and debugging a Scala program might be expected to be learned autonomously.",4
71446,"Great course and very helpful. The following details prevent me from giving it a 5 stars review:* the explanation of the tools to use during the course is very messy. It may discourage people that are less used to work their way around searching working tools.* The audio of the videos sometimes loses A LOT of quality.* For me it seemed like all the assignments were on spot with the balance between theory and standalone thinking. However, I really noticed the jump of time invested for the last assignment. I think the course would highly benefit from having an assignment on Week 5, instead of having that pause in between.Anyway, the course was greatly structured and interesting. Can't wait to go on with the whole specialization!",4
71455,Too mathematical.,4
71456,"The last assignment was definitely a step-up from the other weekly assignments which I found very challenging, this coming from a novice in FP. The lectures were well presented and clearly demonstrated functional techniques as well as the theories behind them. Some may find the lectures a bit tad too academic but thankfully most of such lectures can be skipped without too much detriment to completing the assignment. All in all an excellent course.",4
71474,"The synopsis for the course claims you need previous programming experience << You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient.>>I don't really have any experience in any of these languages except perhaps C from many years ago. However, I do have experience in Lisp and I found that the languages are extremely similar. In many cases I could think in Lisp and write in Scala, which is sort of like Lisp with type annotations, not always, but often. There are a couple of places in the course where the author assumes you know java. I think this is a mistake. You basically need to know the names of some java methods to work the exercise. But I just asked in the forum and someone gave me the correct method names.",4
71487,"Assignments up until the last one were relatively easy, which is the only criticism I have.",4
71498,"Good introduction to functional programming and Scala. Although, the lectures and assignments can get rather mathy (pointless proof of refactoring using maths, Pascals Triangle, Huffman Coding, Counting Change, etc) If you don't have a mathematical background, I would suggest getting the basics of programming down before starting this course so you have less to worry about.I found myself reading up about the maths behind some of the assignments before tackling them, when this could've been avoided with less mathematical assignments. I looked into the first assignment of the next module in the specialization and thought to myself: ""Why bother"" as it just continues the trend of solving more complex mathematical problems -- something rarely tackled as a professional developer.I would've liked to see the standard collection functions taught and used more frequently: map, flatmap, fold, etc.",4
71527,"Specially on the last exercise, there is a bit of a distance between the classes and the challenges. Other than that, the course provides a very good introduction to functional programming at the same time as it introduce the scala language constructs and api.",4
71530,"Good materials and challenging programming exercises. Makes you think. However some material is old and some new, so little confusing. Especially when going through the materials about installing the development environment.",4
71560,Love every part of this course...I can't wait to see what is next!,4
71562,Good Course,4
71564,"Very useful topics and examples, they helped me understand why my company does things in a given way and also allows me to identify improvements on these.",4
71571,This course really helps you to look deeper into the subject. And it helps my directly in my job.,4
71572,Great learning experience,4
71573,"Good content, engaging presentation",4
71574,the course has given me great insight in how best to motivate my team as well as understand what would motivate me.,4
71580,Good course.,4
71582,"Some really good insights into how people are motivated, what works and what doesn't. Very enjoyable course.",4
71586,Very good content and essentially methodology of applying the knowledge learnt in real life cases,4
71596,Very good! Thanks,4
71627,Great and inspiring course.,4
71629,"The course overall provided me with useful ideas and methods for understanding my organization better and the psychology of the workplace. What drives individuals in an organization is a question that permeates the course, and ... how can leaders tap into common organizational behaviors to improve their management? Some of the examples are a bit tired if you've taken just about any psychology course, but the kernels of advice are worth the time if you want to understand your workplace better.",4
71630,Great course! Very helpful for me as I grow my leadership skills to accelerate my business,4
71635,"If you're currently working in a leadership role this course provides some thoughtful exercises and content you can apply to your day job. Good content (nothing earth-shattering, but a good presentation of the issues).",4
71646,"Great strategies and examples to help in communicating a vision, setting goals that align with that vision, and providing and seeking feedback for performance reviews and ongoing.",4
71647,"I've enrolled in SIX mooc's over the last three years. This one has EIGHTEEN SEGMENTS in the WEEK ONE. That seemed daunting... until I did the first five. Short bursts of PURE ADRENALINE. This experience far outpaces all but one other mooc-- Creativity, Innovation & Change. I decided to take this one because a friend in my mastermind group asked if anyone else would take it with her. She is the Director of Coaching for a large soccer club in southern California. Makes sense for her. Simply BLOWS MY MIND. Well done! My only hesitation is that it will require at least 90 mins of concentration EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's more time than I bargained for. Hopefully it'll be worth it.",4
71652,"the only problem i have with this course and the others in this specialization is that the instructors think we are all employed people, leaders, and we are responsible for a team. In fact I am taking this specialization because i will need it in near future. I am a college student and do not have a team i am leading. So some assignments are difficult to complete because they particularly ask you for real life experience, which students my age most probably don't have.",4
71655,"the peer feedback is not working that well. the time range is very short and the rating quality varies, so resubmissions of assignments can mean you have to re-enroll for the following course and lose your cohort.",4
71664,"This is a great course, and it can help you a lot to learn how to understand the motivation process, how to figure out what you may be doing wrong communicating with your team, and how to improve your results together with colleges, subordinates, peers and superiors in your company. Thanks a lot!",4
71673,"Great! I really feel good about this course, Which is quite perfect learning with advanced strategies. I thank to my Professor and University of Michigan.My Twitter : https://twitter.com/PraveeniciciMy LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenicici",4
71692,Dr DeRue's lectures were very helpful for understanding the key take=aways / skills / tips for motivating yourself as well as a team. His lectures are very clear and easy to follow.,4
71693,The content is well presented. The exercises are valuable but the grading process needs improved.,4
71708,good.Might include some more vivid case studies,4
71712,I am able to apply to teams and companies I worked for,4
71720,"Good course, maybe needs a little more practice",4
71723,"Leaders need this course. It's clearly, focus, and amazing.",4
71724,"A good course which provides solid understanding on how to motivate and drive your colleagues and subordinates.The course particulary describes why it is essential to have a vision for you team and how to communicate it to your peers, gives the ideas on how to reward your employees based on their values.",4
71737,"Great content, but it was too easy. I beleive students should have harder tasks to learn.",4
71739,"Thanks to team that put together the course, I really liked itIt covers the topics in sufficient detail with relevant cases /examples, which makes its really easy to get the concept.Would be nice to also have (which is why I did not give it a 5 on 5) - A section on team structure (which in my view is the missing link for this course and which often is a challenge managers cope with and can have a big influence on motivation) and a few more corporate speakers / examples (beyond Menlo, people not from US don't really know much about this company)Overall a course I would surely recommend to all people in my team",4
71751,"Really interesting, and a lot of information.",4
71754,Good and clear lectureincluding a lot of question during the lecture show,4
71759,"I liked it very much, except final grade that there was no time to really do it...",4
71761,THANK YOU!,4
71763,The teacher is very pedagogic.I thought the course was a bit light and could go further in Six-sigma.,4
71765,"Understood the basics of Supply chain Operations. Got to know about the inventory management, EOQ, Wastes and waste management. Last but not least, the DMAIC, Lean project helped me to understand the concepts much better. Good and challenging course! Thank you!",4
71767,It is good,4
71769,Excellent information. Quizzes and tests need to correspond with lectures.,4
71778,"I feel like this course, along with the other courses in this specialization, doesn't cover in-depth applications of supply chain management. The course material covers only the basics, and does not adequately prepare a student to take on a job in supply chain management.",4
71783,Good intro to logistic and supply chain. Well explained and interesting assignments to help put your knowledge into practice. Definitely will continue with next courses.,4
71789,"Straight-forward, basic",4
71792,Lack of interaction with the instructor .,4
71795,very efficient,4
71805,"As such the course content was very good and useful for developing the concepts. I would advise the content design team to expand the teaching examples to areas outside of the US as well, as the business conditions in other regions might be different.",4
71807,Good introductory course!,4
71808,"The contents of this course is very basic and everyone can understand, the quiz and assignments are arranged attractive and challenging. However there are some terms not explained well in the video. I hope the video can be a little bit longer so it can cover more concepts specifically.",4
71810,"it is basic lecture to understand logistic, I recommend you guys to listen this lecture and improve your skills",4
71815,"Really entry level course with not too much content. If you are a faster learner, you can expect to finish this course in a week.",4
71818,very interesting and gives you a nice overview about logistics,4
71823,Mathematical expressions are not there...,4
71834,there wasn't' much classroom discussion lead by staff/or mentors. having more then two people peer-review would be ideal. readings were not easily accessible.,4
71844,"Fantastic course. Gives a bird's eye view of Supply Chain Management and the various strategic aspects of global business. Prof. Kim's lectures are very good. The quizzes are bit on the easier side, though. They could be made somewhat more challenging. Also, the discussion forums... they were silent as the grave. Wish people participated actively participated in conversations. Maybe the course administrators could do something to encourage and promote discussions on the forum in the future offerings of the course.",4
71850,One of the best course that I ever seem before. I'm really happy to do that and I know that was important to my career.,4
71861,Great insight for those who are keen in pursuing supply chain management,4
71862,"Very nice Course, highly recommended for beginners like me, who want to understand fundamentals of how supply - chain works.",4
71865,"This course has given a new and original point of view on how to design, track and improve our operations in the supply chain.It has really been a surprise!Thank you Mr Kim.",4
71868,very useful insights into the subject.A huge kudos to Prof. Bowon Kim.,4
71906,"Very complete for artists, a little less adapted for professionals from outside US but gives you solid understanding of the industry.",4
71911,"This course is very informative about the financial aspects of the music industry. It's sometimes hard to keep my eyes open during the videos, but I think that has more to do with the subject matter than John's presentation.",4
71925,"Interesting, could be more didactic next time. Props.",4
71957,"Excellent course, you get amazing information and valuable guidelines for free!",4
71969,"Very intellectually stimulating, practical yet easy to understand for beginners in this area.",4
71981,"A very informative introductory course, providing basic knowledge and overview of practices in the music business. Particularly useful for artists who want to be educated on the financial and legal aspects in managing music career.",4
71994,Very good! Really help me understand the music market better! =),4
72003,It's a nice course! It'd be better if more caption is available.,4
72014,"Really loved the structure of the course.John kellog's lectures are even though they are a bit boring in the initial stages, they are very important and they create an life long impact on you if you try to focus.I love the way how berklee professors just carry the whole course just sitting with a black background.It needs great skills and experience to have such confidence in presenting a lecture like that..I'm always thankful to coursera for providing this educational courses. Coursera and Berklee college of music for life!",4
72017,It is a very good course so far. Thank you so much for the opportunity to take it. (:,4
72019,Insightful,4
72032,In my opinion. I think this course is too theorical. Please give more practical ways,4
72041,Very good theoretical basis to understand the reality of organizations.,4
72049,It's a good course providing broad overview of the field and details into the important theories. Lots of case studies which I didn't find very relevant but still - nice to have them,4
72053,It was an interesting course and a very helpful one. I suggest it to all the students because I find it rather important.,4
72063,"Good course, the lab classes can be improved further.not easily comprehensive",4
72064,"I very much enjoyed this course because it used a real-world example to teach systems thinking. I also appreciated that the more technical aspects, like using software, had been moved into Labs, which left space and time in the lectures to cover material relevant to the topic.I was surprised at the lack of interaction, though. I have no idea if there were more than a handful of other students nor if there was a support team since there was hardly any participating in the discussion forum. One technical question remained unanswered for example... It seems that there could be a lot of great discussion on the course material if more engagement were encouraged.",4
72065,I enjoyed the course! It helped me organise information about methods in understanding complex systems. I would have definitely used some more detailed explanations about the model building process.Thank you very much for your kind interest and effort!,4
72075,"The course includes different types of materials, like readings and videos aside the lectures to reinforce the concepts studied. There is staff committed to share thoughts on the forums along learners. The presence of two different teachers in the course makes it more diverse. However, I think tests should be redesigned following general principles of Multiple Choice Questions, and lectures could be more engaging by avoiding slides reading.",4
72103,"Good course, interesting theory, opens up a new thinking process for planning classes. The dual purpose classes, i.e. content plus the development of some of those characters strengths discussed in the course will certainly be much more problematic than presented; also the evaluation of character strengths will certainly be problematic for some time to come, but the course is till worth taking.",4
72105,the course enlightens from within and motivates to teach in right direction,4
72125,"Informative and entertaining MOOC!Only thing that keeps me from giving five stars is the omittance of pointing to the ""dangers"" of putting numbers on character traits, for the student and the facility/school.The advantages are nicely presented!",4
72127,"Usable information, well-presented, very accessible. Videos of teachers in class add a great deal to the content.",4
72135,very good so far.,4
72137,"Very good course, easy to attend and informative. I learned new things in a pleasant way.",4
72139,Full of great ideas about teaching character. I see that my approach to teaching has shifted and my students are benefiting.,4
72147,"Great Class, Creative ideas to help student to be successful.",4
72151,"Quite informative. However, if you are not working as a teacher while taking this course it is a bit hard to do the assignments.",4
72160,"Lovely, love the ideas and great mentors",4
72165,informative and encourages your to reflect on your own practice. This course has helped me to think about the kind of classroom I want to establish and the tools and resources I need to succeed in my first year of teaching.,4
72168,"I would have liked to have further material, readings or books. Thanks for the course, it helped me a Lot. Best wishes",4
72171,I'm not a teacher but this was helpful in learning how to teach my own child how to develop,4
72177,I like the examples they gave. Very helpful!,4
72183,Muy instructivo,4
72198,Really enjoyed learning about The Beatles,4
72204,"An excellent overview of the Fab Four's career, with a focus on the songwriting. It would be better if the real music and lyrics could be used and if there were more video and anecdotes incorporated into the storytelling (even if it wasn't the Beatles themselves, but other voices lending their thoughts).",4
72206,The course is great and it helps me in understanding and appreciating their music.,4
72247,That was great!,4
72250,"Great Material. Quizes and discussions didn't work, But i was only auditing the course. There is a wealth of information.",4
72253,"I think some very tough choices were made to fit the course online. It is a successful course, but you can tell that a more in depth version of the course would probably be exciting. You would certainly go further, if you were enrolled at Chapel Hill, and had a couple semesters to contemplate the topic.The instructor is a person who made his own videos and recordings of local storytellers, artists and musicians over a long period of time. You can tell he is a very active collector of local lore. So, he tries to feature this material, sensibly. Some of this material you was great.On the other hand; the knowledge of the course is really only a beginning to what could be learned. For example, when mentioning the photographers or painters of the South, you are not able to see a large number of their pictures. Likewise, when talking about the major writers, such as Faulkner, you do not get to read many longer excerpts of their work. This course provides the names to reference; starting points for further study. The instructor trusts you to investigate these resources on your own.",4
72262,rich and engaging documentaries took 80% of the class content - but still fun to watch!,4
72269,It's a great course with a lot of background on Blues music. Tho I wish there were more music pieces to listen as examples.,4
72273,Great course with a different perspective on history&people. Fun and simple.,4
72284,"interesting, the photos, the film and voice records really bring us back to the time in the past, which also help me know what the real south is.",4
72286,Great reflections on some wonderful oral history research.,4
72289,"A good course for anyone who want to know more about the American South, but a little boring~",4
72291,"This course is complete and does offer very good information on the music, stories, and art of the American South. I really enjoyed the blues music information presented to students.",4
72295,Interesting course covering various aspects of the south americans culture.,4
72297,Really good course. Happy I had a chance to take it :),4
72299,"I took this course with a special interest on the musical aspect, namely the blues, of course. In that regard the course is very superficial, but has some interesting stuff even so. The other aspects of literature, painting, and the more popular arts (kilts, oral traditions, etc.) where a nice surprise. This course gives a view of a cultural aspect of America that is very interesting and mostly unknown, particularly, I guess, to a non American. I advise this course to anyone who is interested in ethnology, folklore and popular art and music and is not already familiarized with the American South.",4
72303,One of the best course I have ever taken. I wish I would have taken this in High School.,4
72311,This course increased my thirst of learning in a new field.,4
72319,"Just the assignments were lengthy & took a lot of time, its should only be MCQ.",4
72322,It was really helpful to understand fundamentals of time value of money and capital budgeting.,4
72338,"covers the basics of finance, compounding, NPV, IRR, questions are practical.",4
72353,Great course. Instructor takes time to explain the concepts in detail. Assignments are really good!,4
72365,"Enjoyed the content, but wish there was better assistance in working through problems. The message boards have not hit the mark, but I will make a better effort in these next module",4
72374,"Very good material and I'm grateful they provided it. There were many issues with the problem sets: incorrect, unclear, beyond scope of course, placed in wrong order of content. I reported all of these and never got even one response, perhaps because I'm not a paying customer. I had considered paying for the certificate but the more issues I encountered the more I was relieved not to have paid. But a great course nonetheless.",4
72380,"Loved the outline of the various areas where music has a strong effect: body, mind, psyche, relationships, community, and culture. I really enjoyed the videos by Dr. McFerrin. She provides excellent overviews of the issues at hand. I also loved learning about the different perspectives coming from presenters from all over the world. This really enriched the overview of research in the field. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the title is very general and therefore a bit misleading. This course has a very strong Musical Therapy slant which is not obvious from the title. I was expecting to learn more about the scientific research about music on the general population (similar to Amelia Collins' approach or the research in Stacy Horn's book ""Imperfect Harmony"", not in a therapeutic setting. Anyway, if the organisers change the title then participants will know better what to expect.",4
72408,I love this program. Building me up on how to start my scholarship program.,4
72410,The professor did a great job simplifying the material down. The short videos really helped me get acclimated to the format of Coursera. The examples were very clear and easy to understand.,4
72412,"This course is very helpful to really get a taste of the financial models used for investing. If you are one of those who love to break down a problem and base your decisions on an in depth analysis, then this is the course for you. This course only talks about stocks and not other financial securities, however the main advantage of this course is that you would learn concepts, ideas and logics that could very well be extended to other financial securities. The course is easy to understand but it is always a good idea to have basics of economics and mathematics brushed up beforehand.",4
72413,"Lots of Mathmatics. I think there is far too much mathematics being put into portfolio management and not enough emphasis on behavioral models of investment nor consumer driven markets. Like much of the investment world, this is going far too quantitative and searching for too many scientific mathematical relationships that don´t always pan out for real stock prices.",4
72416,good course,4
72420,"Maybe because I am a graduate student,it seems a little lengthy.",4
72424,"The material in this course is very interesting. I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms. I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry-level manner - it will take some hands-on practice with real datasets to build expertise, understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base. I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming. I completed the Python for Everybody specialization, but still struggled with the programming in this course.",4
72439,Course covers in depth many topics. Only some issues with using Pandas.,4
72441,"Far too math, much less practice",4
72446,"In most cases offers great mathematical and logical clarity of the machine learning models. The professor does not dumb-down the concepts, but also tries hard to go through all the steps so that you understand them.I am taking a point down for- those few moments when it was not 100% clear, where I feel things were left out- the practical side, there could have been more practical explanations, tips and tricks, and even more datasets than just the one house dataset that was used in each assignment- for the usage of Graphlab Create which is not the industry standard and is not open source",4
72457,Great course. Can only be better if we were taught in the industry standard libraries (fe. SciPy),4
72473,"Overall its a good course on Regression, although its more driven toward mathematics and statics.",4
72505,"A good course overall. at time, the programming assignment is somewhat confusing.",4
72506,"Nice Course, every concept was explained in necessary details, the quizzes should include questions which should be inferential rather than only output based.",4
72507,"Very good course, going through plenty of used regression techniques.",4
72509,"Excellent course overall. Only issue was the inaccurate instructions for those using sklearn instead of graphlab (with graphlab it's very easy to do, but a bit painful for those like me who like to write a program instead of doing in interactive mode only).",4
72510,"This course covered a lot of material on linear regression. Be prepared for plenty of math (mostly algebra, a small amount of calculus). You should also be prepared to write a small-ish, if focused, amount of Python. The time commitment was higher than expected. I spent between 1-2 hours on lecture, and each programming assignment was between 2-3 hours, but overall the course is well worth the time investment. The instructors (Emily in particular for this course) are excellent, and present the lectures in an easy to follow format. I'm looking forward to the next course in the specialization.",4
72511,Great course,4
72517,"Good course that covers the intuitions and goes a bit deeper with the implementation. Main down point is the fact that they try to get you to use graph frames and the alternative pandas route is often a bit of an afterthought, occasionally leading to trouble/confusion with certain quizzes.",4
72525,"Excellent course. If you want to learn the mathematical intuitions behind Lasso, Ridge and general ML concepts, this course breaks them down into details. This is the only course I've found on the many MOOC sites out there that goes into this much depth. One downside is that Coursera lacks support in general, but I do not consider it downside of this course but Coursera's. In terms of frameworks, many people like me have completed the course using Numpy and Scikit-learn instead of Dato, so it is doable!",4
72529,The course was excellent. It helped me understand the basic concepts of regression. This course helps us think why and when a model needs to be used which I think is more important in the current day of big data.,4
72531,Hope can recommend some reading materials for some theory parts.,4
72540,Very good course. I really liked it.,4
72549,"Excellent series of courses. Before this was confused what was my interest in Computer Science, now I've found Machine Learning, perfect.",4
72578,Good to have deep insight into regression and various popular algorithm,4
72589,"Overall, the course was really good. But, it would be great if the concept of co-ordinate descent was explained much more clearly.",4
72592,Great introductory course for regression analysis and very practical indeed!,4
72603,"This course start from problems. So this great to motivate the content and let student know why. However, there are lot of confusion questions that lead to miss understand the exercise problems.",4
72606,Really good course. Provides basic theoretical and hands on knowledge in the regression.Step by step programming quiz some times not demonstrate enough best practices or conceptual ideas. For example I would expect that if at step 1 we asked to assess performance based on single feature then at step 2 based on several features and compare results. But in most of the cases such comparison not proposed and results not explained. In addition it is not always clear why prediction accuracy better or worse.,4
72608,"This was a deep dive into all things regression and I guess having a background in mathematics helped out a lot with following the material. However, I wish there was a better distribution of quizzes and assignments throughout the weekly lessons because they seemed to all come during the end of the lesson. All in all this was a very good course and I wish that I would have taken a similar course during my undergrad.",4
72613,"Useful to get a first understanding but do not feel comfortable to use any of it in real case scenarios. Could give solutions at the end of the whole course to see best coding, and unsolved questions.",4
72628,Great,4
72653,"Excellent lectures, evenly paced and nicely balanced between theory and practice, and mostly great quizzes and practice problems. However, the complete lack of instructor participation in the forums leaves many student questions unanswered.",4
72663,Very challenging course. Could have been 5 had the course duration been stretched by 2 weeks.Tough to complete and do justice to the subject matter in the time frame provided.,4
72664,This course is well structured. It covered a good parts of details I was missing on my machine learning path.,4
72675,The course is really well explained and skills obtained are quite valuable in the labor market,4
72696,"The course was very helpful. It would have been better if the tutors explained how they have arrived at some values they used like initial weights, tolerance, threshold etc.., so that the learning is comprehensive.",4
72700,detailed but slower...,4
72704,"Good introduction to linear regression. The quizzes are moderately difficult, and can be somewhat time consuming. There is a lot of depth to this topic, and tho this course touches on a lot of it, it won't be enough to get a very thorough understanding. In general I'm really glad I took this course",4
72705,"An excellent and quite extensive foray into regression analyses from single-variable linear regression to nearest-neighbor and kernel regression techniques, including how to use gradient vs. coordinate descent for optimization and proper L1 and L2 regularization methods. The lecture slides have some questionable pedagogical and aesthetic qualities, and they could use some more polish from someone who specializes in teaching presentation methods, but the meat of the course comes from its quizzes and programming assignments, which are well split between practical use (via Graphlab Create and SFrame) and a nuts-and-bolts assignment that have you implement these methods from scratch. An extremely valuable course for someone who wants to use these for a data science application but also wants to understand the mathematics and statistics behind them to an appreciable degree.",4
72709,"The video lectures are particularly clear and with a good balance between intuition and details.The assignments are interesting and they require some time even if they are not the most challenging.Nice the choice to use Graphlab but to give detailed instructions also for Pandas and leaving the possibility open to use different software.I will certainly take the following ones.If you are not interested in the the full specialization and already have some exposure to python notebooks, it is possible to follow this course without the previous one.",4
72725,"The course was mostly well taught, and having the two programming assignments each week was useful. One so you could learn the technique, and another so you could learn the underlying algorithm. Some of the topics were occasionally light and too fast on the detail, but overall a very good course.",4
72728,This is an excellent course to get the math involve behind the regression. Instructors are awesome. I also feel that Bayseain regression should have been included. I missed that part badly.,4
72731,A lot of new concepts were introduced with good clarity. All the math was less rigorous which was perfect to understand and get hold on important techniques.,4
72735,"Programming assignment sometime ambiguious and hard to follow. A lot of time you have no idea WHICH dataset they are talking about e.g. ""query house"" in the last lesson.Overall it's a great course.",4
72743,Nice course! Thank you very much ~,4
72747,"Good structure, but maybe a bit too basic and slow pace.",4
72750,"I think you should make update process of Graphlab more intuitive, this was the only problem I have faced during this wonderful course!",4
72753,"Learn more about linear regression, ridge and so on.",4
72755,"Great course! Good balance of theory and practical application. I'm glad that we didn't use GraphLab as much as in the first course and more exercises were implementing the algorithms.My one recommendation for improvement would be to revise some of the assignments with an eye for making the instructions more clear. There were a few--particularly week 5--where I understood the concepts, but it was very unclear what exactly we were being asked to do.Looking forward to the next course!",4
72765,Excellent course to take a deep dive into Regression concepts. Could have been better if the hands on part would have been in R - Programming as well.,4
72769,Quite a hard course...But laid great foundations and reduced the dependence on graphlab.Thanks Emily!,4
72775,Better deep understanding of common machine learning concepts. Still learn some different things than those exposed on andrew ng course,4
72777,This course is so well structured and the is awesome,4
72781,"This course touches on basic concepts quite nicely and should help students with adequate math background to gain a good understanding of regression on both high and low level.A text book and optional exercises could help attain better theoretical ground for regression. In general, references and suggested reading are missing from this specialization.I would also like to see optional programming assignments on publicly available data sets other than the repeatedly used house prices data.",4
72786,"An excellent overview of regression techniques in Machine Learning, with a very well thought-out balance between explaining concepts, providing enough maths to support the concepts (even with some optional ""deep dive"" lessons). For those interested in the really technical details, I think this course is an excellent start to get a grip on the concepts before diving into formal proofs. Highly recommended.",4
72789,Its a great course.Please add a module about how to find the significant variables after using all these technologies.,4
72803,"Courses like this are always difficult to judge because of the great variety of students coursera reaches. That is, some class members finished this course in the first week it was open, others still struggled till the last minute. For some the math was too simply, for others the python programming was too confusing. All in all it strikes a reasonable balance between novice learners and more advanced students.What the course could stand to really benefit from is some kind of repository of code, for those students who successfully completed the assignments to compare to their own. It seems pretty clear that there are some advanced python users whose insights could help improve one's coding skills.",4
72807,"This was much more in-depth than the intro course in the sequence, which was exactly what I was hoping for.I still think that it could stand to be more challenging. Perhaps the instructors might offer some optional, more challenging exercises. Or, maybe students could choose an alternate ""challenge version"" of the homework that contains fewer hints.",4
72821,Some of the quizes and assignments had grading issues but I thought the curriculum was great. All of the optimization techniques learned to solve for regressions seem like they could be useful in other areas of machine learning and other applications.,4
72822,Very thorough and challenging class.Highly recommended.,4
72826,Nioce course. Compreensive notes and nice (&fu,4
72845,"This gives a nice survey of the techniques and approaches of Linear Regression. Lectures are structured well, and mathematical derivations are provided as optional lectures. Each week has a quiz that goes over the material, as well as programming assignments that are meant to provide a higher level understanding via Dato's GraphLab Create, as well as lower level understanding with Numpy.I am dropping a star because some portions of the programming exercises seemed to be contrived.",4
72847,Excellent course except the last week :),4
72852,Good and Insightful,4
72855,"In the end of the course it became a bit boring to work with the same dataset over and over again. But I learned a lot about such algorithms as LASSO, Ridge regression. I guess that overall there's a good balance between math, theory and practice.",4
72873,"Wonderful lectures and good assignments. Very, very clear presentations.Minor drawbacks: there's no assistance available for the assignments (which can be quite difficult). The quizzes require sometimes information that is not directly available in the video lectures.Note that it takes more hrs per week than mentioned (but it's worthwhile!).",4
72882,"Really enjoyed the course - I did well, but this is really in-depth material. I feel like it would be really difficult to implement an ML regression algorithm from scratch in a job material.I would like to see more interactivity in the lectures (short-quizzes interspersed in the videos) in addition to the long programming assignments at the end of the course.-Thomas",4
72883,"I appreciate the nuts and bolts focus on implementation that facilitates development of intuition, intuition that for me at least does not come from presentation of the mathematics in isolation.",4
72884,"Good course! Teachers are perfect and knowledge is overall, but the exercise need some improvement.",4
72888,"like it so far, after one weeki like the way they let us code the procedures ourselves.expect it to level up in the upcoming weeks and classes",4
72890,"(Beta-Test review)Status: Still on the first week.The content is an easy follow, though it might seem to be a slight difficulty for those without a heavy background in calculus. So far, all the links (to the downloadable csv's and ipynb files) work well. All the videos have no apparent bugs and/or problems. I would also suggest to have the slides available for download as in the previous module.I don't think writing over the animation is a bad thing as long as it's still understandable.As an aside, I suggest editing out the swallowing sound you might occasionally hear whenever either instructor is speaking. To some, it seems a bit off-putting.Great course, overall.Thanks,Marvin",4
72891,too much theory,4
72899,I would like some input from the instructors on all the Graphic Design specialization courses.,4
72903,Good short course. I would have like a few more quizzes on top of the assignements for repetition,4
72906,somewhat the content is a little bit less,4
72911,Very Helpful! But maybe when an experienced lecturer grades the assignments it will make a difference.,4
72914,The course was really fun and I learned a lot. I wish there was more to this course.,4
72922,Fascinating and organized!,4
72923,Very basic introduction to typography. The material a bit more simplistic than I had hoped.,4
72926,Good introduction to the topic.,4
72931,Course stuff could have better interaction and response time and grading could be more challenging.,4
72943,"I enjoyed the information, although the typography section was a bit brief. The course does help myself and others to get an idea of what an actual on-site course might consist of. I have been wanting to take a type/lettering class at my current school but have had the chance. Course was mostly informative and taught me ways to research and design.",4
72948,"I could learn this course in the ""step by step"" way, by refined assignments.",4
72950,This is a fantastic course to start with Typography. This course will help you get the basics of typography and fonts. Highly recommended if you are starting out in this field.,4
72951,"I would have liked a few more / longer videos, but I really found the assignments helpful. I like how each one built off of each other, so the final project did not feel so overwhelming.",4
72964,very enlightening and informative course,4
72965,"The last assignment wasn't as specific, and I wound up giving people lower grades than I should've. Be more specific when you use the phrase ""secondary piece"". I thought it was referring to the notes we took, not the text that's supposed to go below the title and subtitle.Really good class. It was very interesting.",4
72980,Great Course! Strongly Recommend!,4
72981,The videos were very succinct and unobtrusively informative. The professor's approach was very good for a fundamentals course. My only real complaint would be the peer review system being the only provider of grades on the final project. The final grading feedback would be benefitted by the professor himself or a set of trained moderators that have more insight on design conventions.,4
72983,Enjoyed the history of the typefaces,4
72984,3.5 starsA quick introduction to Typography that left me feeling there is so much more to learn and know.,4
72985,Clear speech in video and instructions.,4
72994,I had fun with this course and learned new things.,4
72995,Thoroughly enjoyable and didactic! Some further elaboration on each subject would do it merit. Poster design should be optional — not everyone is keen on handling software.,4
72996,"Nice, interesting course. I went through it with pleasure.But there is so little information, you can definitely give more :)",4
73012,"Fantastic introduction to type, even if it's a tad short.",4
73018,Well-made videos. Assignments could be more rigorous. Not too much overlap with first course in specialization.,4
73019,Lots of interesting insights and good structure of the course. I wish the areas were covered a little more extensively though.,4
73021,Very good as an introductory course!,4
73024,I'm hooked on typography now. I've read a number of the books that were recommended. Instructor was interesting and the material was engaging. Would recommend.,4
73028,really good intro.,4
73031,"Overall I really enjoyed this course. My only input is that it could be a bit more advanced. I realize it's an ""Introduction"" course, but if you have just the smallest interests in typography, theres a lot of these things, you already know.",4
73036,Very good overall explanations on the basics of Typography. Anther Kiley did a great job of explaining things in a simple yet detailed format. I never realized there was so much to letters and words in type!,4
73041,Nice course! Hope the teacher can give us more instruction about how to design typography.,4
73065,"I was not 100% motivated about this cours and I thought it would be easy...but I was wrong!, it was serious stuff to deal with typo and I learn so much in the process, I saw some pretty works of my peers and it gave me the push to make my best!",4
73087,Very basic course. I enjoyed the lessons and the assignments. Gave some fundamental view and perspective about the field of typography.,4
73089,"This class taught me a lot about the basics of typography, however I didn't feel too encouraged creatively compared to the last class in this series. I understand that type is a bit more structured and requires more attention to detail and rules than other forms of visual art, but I wish there was a bit more content similar to the content in week 4 where we are encouraged to get creative.",4
73090,Very informative.,4
73098,"Nice, brief intro to typography. Good, clear lecture content and interesting assignments. I feel like the ""by the book"" assignment should not be entirely peer graded.",4
73103,a bit short :),4
73108,"Hard Topic, You must take all the basics in multivariate statistical analysis first.",4
73120,"The course is excellent for beginners who already have a basic knowledge of music theory. The course is a great way to build on that knowledge. I play guitar, but this course was just as applicable to non-piano players. Thank you, great job.",4
73128,It was a really good course. Something very different for me. I just wish it was a litter longer than 4 weeks.,4
73129,A bit short. The discussions on cosmology is difficult to understand for someone like me who does not learn anything about yet.,4
73133,I liked this MOOC very much. I have learnt about new concepts about science and philosophy. I strongly this MOOC to students and working people interested about philosophy and science.,4
73135,"The broad principles of the progress of science including paradigm shifts is interesting. The physics involved in the treatment of Cosmology is complex, but the important concepts were beautifully extracted by the lecturer. The lecture slides were a valuable resource to review before each quiz. After the course, I feel that I have tasted the flavor of the astrophysics, enjoyed it, but by no means have I begun to be an astrophysicist .",4
73152,The Case Assignments are pretty useful,4
73159,Insightful and interesting journey. I had to learn new vocabulary and way of thinking but did appreciate the interesting intellectual excursion.,4
73171,"I thought there will be more on interfaces and views.Not really ""Best practices in interface design"" course.But it is good in Core Data and UITableViews. Worth time.Change name! :-)",4
73176,"The course is quite nice, but actually I was expecting something more design / ui related and less code.The name of the course and description is a bit misleading.",4
73185,Great!,4
73202,"This course has been enlightening and enriching for me in terms of how governance works in America. The issues raised can be applicable to many other countries in the world. However, this is not the course for you if you are looking for theoretical and analytical skills as this course is structured around sharings and exchanges with public figures about the current and future agenda of the US. (This is just my personal opinion and others may disagree me with me on certain aspects.)",4
73209,"The content is well modularized, introduces a range of topic, but is much more of a discourse than an introduction to to process of evaluating a policy challenge. Not many tactical ideas, mostly a survey of the policy challenges that a new generation of policy-makers and new stakeholders will face. So the focus is not on ""how"" but it introduces Public Policy as a concept in a nice discursive way worthy of your time.",4
73220,A very interesting course with great speakers.,4
73222,Great discussions!,4
73224,"Very much enjoyed the course and the discussions (particularly on healthcare policy). However, the title should reflect that the course is entirely US-centric.",4
73225,GREAT! great professors and a lot of passion! wich there were more suggested readings!,4
73230,Need to include challenge faced by Developing countries,4
73237,"I thoroughly enjoyed and benefitted from this course, however, I also feel there was too much of an emphasis on U.S Policy. It is understandable, but other than that, it was great!",4
73239,Engaging information!,4
73253,I thought it was a great course. It really prompted me to consider the different aspects of the political landscape and how it will look drastically different in the coming years as my generation enters into the field. I recommend this course as a good starting ground for those wanting to gain more perspective for those considering the public service route.,4
73254,"Helped me understand the key challenges to Public Policy, albeit to the US.However, many of the challenges are global and also impact the developing nations of Asia.",4
73259,"It is very US oriented, Which is not necessarily a negative aspect, but please mention that in the course structure more clearly. Although Professor Warburg is very inspiring, the optimistic attitude towards policy leaders is what I think is needed for the younger generation who get sidelined by politics and not policy. It was quite rewarding. Thankyou.",4
73261,Speakers were great. But the content was very U.S related.,4
73262,"Interesting course, exceeded my expectation",4
73275,A wonderful course with very well organized discussions and inspiring talks.,4
73279,Great lectures. I wish there were more in-depth assignments and detailed handouts.,4
73284,Nice course with lots of background information,4
73286,"The contents of the course were relevant and highlighted some real issues and considerations to have in mind, but quizzes were a bit ambiguous and there were some issues in there.",4
73290,Give students a whole picture of the MNA and relative techniques. Also provide us with useful tools which can be quite helpful during work.,4
73297,Good material with a very generalized but advanced overview of concepts.Some fatigue and lack of confidence was noted in the lecturers. More confidence with assured speaking will elevate the review stars.,4
73304,Great!,4
73306,To do well in this course you definitely need a background in biology and anatomy. This course is fast paced and you might want to use the whole week to review the videos in order to do the best on the quizzes.,4
73315,IT IS A GOOD COURSE.,4
73317,"Quizzes do not always function correctly, but the content is great.",4
73318,"Thanks again. Great Job.Your class provides good general knowledge, to benefit many students.The Lessons will help many students, to make Better Choices in their HEALTH future.Best; ""the"" DONALD from PENNSYLVANIA !",4
73327,"Overall the course was very helpful and I was able to understand it without prior knowledge (except for my high school biology class). All the case studies examples often helped to understand the problem further and I appreciated all of the graphic content that was crucial for imagining the ways the systems work. I finally understood some of those things, that are just sort of ""known"" as for example why contraceptives might be bad for women, or how could drinking too much water actually kill someone.I was a little bit disappointed with all the gramatical mistakes in presentations and many mistakes in english subtitles that were provided (in names of organ parts/hormones etc.) ow switching the names of certain hormones/parts in spoken language, which often made it harder to understand or connect something. Furthermore some of the quiz/test questions were more like ""just guess it"" or up to the student to research the problem further, which is fine but it kinda disrupts the quizzing process.Many thanks to both great teachers that have put this course together, it's definitely worth enrolling in!",4
73340,"Is a long, long course..but is a great course!!",4
73342,"Interesting course, but a bit too easy even for beginners.",4
73347,It's really a worthwhile course.,4
73348,Very informative and concise.,4
73360,"Some of the final exams included information that was not in the lectures, so there were a few times I felt the need to refer to outside sources just to pass a lecture. I have no previous medical knowledge or training, so this course may be better suited for someone who is a pre-med student and at least understands some of wha",4
73362,A very nice experience! Good to review the majority of the lessons that I've learned a few years a go.Some (minor) issues with the quality of the videos but the overall rate of the course is very good!,4
73370,Interesting and informative - thank you to the lecturers for covering so much detail.,4
73376,"Very comprehensive course. However, I found one professor to teach above the level of an introductory course. This is kind of a misnomer. To me, this course was not introductory. It was very difficult. Although, it would be good for someone that is taking the MCAT's. My points are: Very comprehensive, quite a lot of information (if you don't have chemistry and microbiology backgrounds it is easy to get lost), quite difficult tests and quizzes, rewarding if you can finish it.",4
73378,it really benefit me in my medical studybut really you need to use more photo and educational method to clarify the subject,4
73386,"Nice videos, well explained. The powerpoints are extremely useful and clear. However sometimes there is a confusion between what is said in the videos and in the lecture notes and the quiz questions. It may just be me however. Apart from that last thing, the rest is all good!",4
73388,The course is very detailed and I like the way the instructors explain the material in an in depth way. I am learning a lot.,4
73402,"in this course programme ,concepts have been explained very well",4
73410,"Very interesting, although sometimes there is so much information that it prevents you from applying the acquired knowledged into practical day-to-day situations",4
73414,Prof. Jakoi and Prof. Carbrey are able to stimulate the curiosity about every apparatus of human body. This course is an essential step to introduce the further subjects of Medicine. Congratulations to the organizers.,4
73430,Week 5 is the most interesting!! :)),4
73431,"All the content provided is very good and the tests are of a good level too.Was just sad that the course on GI system didn't say a word about the extra organ represented by our microbiome, that nothing was said about the immune system, hematopoiesis, developmental physiology and genetics, the detailed functions of the liver (nothing on the prduction of urea and the detox mechanisms), and some behavioral aspects could be interesting.",4
73432,Very good basics. One star dropped for being a little too theoretical. Sometimes would have been nice to know more why some things are the way they are in the body.,4
73433,Excellent overview of the topic and a good launching point for further studies. Requires some basic chemistry but otherwise easy to get into.,4
73458,This is a wonderful class.,4
73462,"I think it's a very good course, but there are parts that can be improved and some that should be addressed in more leisurely fashion, this is the case of the nervous system and the endocrine system. Thank you very much for your effort.",4
73474,"The structure is a bit confusing, and the review is not quite as intensive as I would like.Otherwise, it's awesome. The videos are good, the instructors speak at speeds just right, most of the slides are sparsely worded and well illustrated, the concepts are explained in depth... Awesome is the word.",4
73485,Great course helps understand information easily.,4
73487,"Overall very well structured course, I think some of the slides, especially for calculating the math numbers are quite poor and often don't show the working out as clearly as you'd like. Great teacher, just a little more explanation on the maths would have been extra helpful.",4
73491,"A very good course indeed. It explains with a good and simple way how the economy works at an individual level and at a business level. The major downside on the other hand, is that it is focused mainly in America. Non the less, it remains a very instructive and constructive course. Personally, i highly recommend it, to anyone, who wants to acquire some basic knowledge in microeconomics, or wants to see how economy works.",4
73492,"The course covers basics brilliantly but may be a little too fast in its pace with more focus on ""nuggets"" of knowhow rather than explaining theories. Perhaps would be nicer to understand the different kinds of markets with more real life examples that go into detail one level higher.",4
73493,Explain the complex economic principles in easy examples and show case. Heavy knowledge with lightning lecture. Good course!,4
73496,Get to know the bolts and nuts of the world mechanism.,4
73502,This course helps me a lot,4
73503,"Great course!Peter Navarro made an attempt to show material in a very funny, easy manner and I think reached success. It was very simple for me tp understand the material. Special thanks for Ukrainian subtitles (my native language). Ther were some technical faults in course (pictures in quizes sometimes did not shown correctly, final exam had a mistake in question about interest rate and present revenue).Nevertheless thank you for your job!",4
73508,"Great course,, easy to follow and informative. I would love to see a case study to follow through some examples as it would be an interesting way to tie together some information.",4
73512,Great course. However the test matter could have been made better with more case study analysis to apply the principles learned in the class as opposed to being too close to the examples from the class and being very definition based.,4
73513,"Very good, but i think it needs more activities to feel more the aproach.",4
73514,Great course !!!,4
73515,very well lecture to improve our knowledge...nice course,4
73516,a very good course,4
73526,Love it! Learn a lot! But it will be nice if the authors recommend books for non-economist students.,4
73527,I think the teacher tried make things about as easy to understand as possible. I definitely feel stronger having finished it.,4
73530,professor peter navarro is the best :),4
73537,Very informative and very well explained for beginners,4
73540,Stay up on your readings within this class.,4
73544,This course covers the basics well.,4
73545,"Nice course. I have learned a lot. The only drawback is that the quiz answers are sometimes really ambiguous, especially if one has general knowledge of the topic, but did not watch the video. Would be nice to see some more general questions without too much focus on the wording from the course. Another thing is that because we cannot see the right answers the learning feedback from the courses is also significantly impacted - although I understand reasoning behind this.",4
73548,it was a good follow through tuition along side my class lessons in school.,4
73552,some of the slayts were hard to read just because of its page color.examples from real life were the best part of the program. thanks!,4
73553,Would help to have problem sets with more challenging questions.Quizes too easy and had too much emphasis on memorization.Lectures were good-concise and interesting.,4
73575,3.5 actually but there are no half-stars,4
73642,pace is too slow. more exercises would be great,4
73647,Excellent course for learning the very basics of Python. The class was well organized and easy to understand. I liked the exercises. They were a bit challenging in the end. My only negative thing to say is that I hope they are able to update the time it takes to grade assignments on the server. I can't wait to take the next course!,4
73653,Good intro course. set realistic expectations for someone who has never done this before.,4
73670,Very Good fro Beginners!,4
73673,Excellent way to start learning Python. Course focuses on the fundamentals of programming as well as syntax for python.,4
73679,Great for beginners. OK for intermediate,4
73681,Great intro to 100% new programmers!Very quick reminder of basic programming constructs and their implementation in Python for those with previous experience.,4
73688,"Covers the basic of python, can be more challenging though",4
73690,Excellent course for python beginners! Thank You so much!,4
73692,Good introductory course for Python. Covers the basics!,4
73712,"It is somehow fundamental, but it was useful.",4
73720,"This course conducted by Dr Chuck is delivered in laymen term which is very easy to understand, especially for newbie in programming world. TQ so much. It totally worth my time and ""pain"" but it does open my eyes about python.",4
73722,"Homework assesments can be improved. I^ve seen that in sam assignments even if the answer is correct, grading sytem was not able to understand it.",4
73727,"I think this course is espetacular for new programmers, I really like the explanations about how the python works, this way become easy to understand and learn programing.",4
73745,will help to have strong basics,4
73748,Rudimentary introduction of programming. Beginners would find this course very helpful in understanding Python,4
73754,Very basic introduction to Python.,4
73761,"Nice overview, but quite slow at some points. Book is really helpful",4
73777,The training session was good and easy to understand,4
73783,"Awesome programs, awesome staff, and very easy to understand videos and book! I couldn't have chosen a better course to start with.",4
73787,Great introductory overview and insights into the language.,4
73803,A pretty good start for anyone who wants to do programming!,4
73811,Good one,4
73812,Good for me!!,4
73813,goooooood course if you do this free,4
73860,Excellent for beginners. Perhaps not as much value for people who have used other programming languages. I am an R user and found this easy and a good introduction. Thank you professor Severance,4
73863,Worth the knowledge. Notes were fun to take. Strongly Reccomend,4
73935,Superb TO start programming inn Python,4
73955,"It's a good course, but sometimes I hava problems with web-bags (my information - actions) were unavailable or didn't update",4
73964,it was actually good and it helps from basics,4
73967,"The course was great. The videos and assignments were clear, well paced, and the forums were useful in getting questions answered. The lecturer made the material easy to understand. I've taken down one star just because I think potentially more ground could have been covered in the course, and the quiz and assignments were quite easy (in other words, could have been more challenging). Great experience overall though!",4
73979,"Great, very easy for beginner. My only problem was with last exercise because I didn't understand very clearly how to get the program to find out min and max numbers. Video and book don't explain that part very clearly. But everything else is just fantastic.Thank you.",4
74008,Great course for those don't have programming experience!,4
74014,Wonderful course. Dr. Severance simplifies the daunting world of coding (it's helpful though that python is an easier language to take--a gateway CS language in my opinion) for everyone. Seriously. I think of writing code now like writing English essays (which I enjoy; I'm sure very few share my feeling). Wished it'd update to python3.5 though.,4
74015,Confidence builder!,4
74023,"Dr. Severance takes students at a nice slow pace through this first course, which for experienced programmers like me can seem too slow at times, but it's a good pace with the premise, ""Programming for Everybody,"" in mind. I would have like more programming examples, perhaps as non-graded assignments, in place of the lesser-value bonus interviews and Office Hours segments.",4
74034,A bench mark for easy understanding of programming.,4
74045,"It was a good course. Although i wasn't new to programming, but I found the tutor very knowledgeable to let us think the code logic on our own meanwhile making us learn. The content is good too.Thank you !",4
74046,"I go to learn lot of programming concept, the instructor was very involved in the course. Thank you.",4
74061,"A really good introductory course for anyone interested in getting into Python. If you're experienced in coding, the beginning is a bit slow, but it picks up quickly by introducing Python specific features.",4
74081,It was pretty good to learn from base.,4
74094,"I would love to see more emphasis on the syntax of the language from where colons should be used to ""try"" then ""except"".",4
74099,This is really a very nice course. All the material is good enough for a beginner.,4
74103,"Good for the beginner who doesn't know much about programming. For me, I knew the vast majority of this material so I flew through it. I'm looking forward to the other courses so I can learn something substantially new.",4
74108,"It's a wonderful course! The only problem is the course uses an older version of python and I can't practice the problems on my latest text wrangler or pycharm. Still, everything else is perfect.",4
74118,great introductory class,4
74134,Simple to understand and helps student to learn programming from scratchwith simplest examples,4
74145,"The teacher is explaining the basics of the language very well. My only issue was that he was a bit too slow for me at times, making me skip ahead. Looks like he's going on long detail to help students who have never programmed, but for those who have some experience it can be tedious.",4
74163,"Very Nice interface, Mobile friendly, Just for writing coding assignments I had to use laptop. If App supported the same, It would have been more convenient. While course syllabus is direct and gives one idea of applying teaching for practical purpose, which is good right. And Faculty is nice, explains the concept in easy way.",4
74164,I think the exercises were to easy to pass.,4
74168,The course is brilliant. I put 4 instead of 5 only because of the last assignment which seemed way beyond a normal level of difficulty for this course.,4
74178,It was awesome course. Charles is super professional and entertaining. But I think It can be better with a little bit more complicated assignment problems.,4
74184,Tutarial was good for very begineer,4
74187,Very useful course. A bit slow for people who has some computing background. But definitely recommend,4
74189,It's interesting to learn Python .,4
74199,Great course and easy to follow. Can improve the colors on the videos.,4
74202,It is a great course for all those who wants to learn a programming lenguage.,4
74205,Yes this was very basic course.,4
74236,"The last two weeks had too much material crammed into them, whereas the first few weeks were a bit dull. Otherwise the course was excellent for beginners such as myself!",4
74239,I think it's a good start on Python and programming.,4
74241,Awesome course for beginners...,4
74245,"If you have any previous experience in coding, choose a harder course. This one is really basic.",4
74273,a good start to learning python,4
74279,"It would be good if the course can include the worked solutions to the assignments, and solutions to all the examples at the end of the chapters in the textbook",4
74282,A very good explanatory by Dr Charles severance about Python Introduction course with tips and tricks taught very well.,4
74288,"It was a really nice course for a beginner in Python like me. The pace could have been better specially or people with prior programming experience Anyway, it was fun learning Python. The instructor was awesome.",4
74295,Very Good Overview of the basics of Python. I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn the how to start coding in Python.,4
74301,Professor Chuck is very humorous. It is strongly recommended to those who have zero prior experience on programming. It is fun and easy.,4
74307,"This is amazing course to learn programming. Even person from non programming background can get confidence at this,",4
74323,A great class for easing into the world of Python.,4
74325,"There are many redundant aspects in the course. Installation instructions were for outdated OS. I did learn the basics how to program in Python though, and that's a good thing.",4
74327,Great Content!,4
74330,Amazing Course,4
74332,"Good for the beginner who knows nothing about programming and just have litter knowledge about basic components of computer. This course is not recommended for IT professionals, may be other courses in this specialization may be effective for them.",4
74334,still getting confused when there is reported error when programming. The way that I can fix is coding on the note pad and paste is to the web to see what's wrong on that.,4
74342,Great course - I like the short book chapters and short videos. Looking forward to the next course.,4
74367,Course is good for getting of basic knowledge about Python programming,4
74389,Very good course for the beginner,4
74393,A good introductory course to Python.Intended for real beginners,4
74401,"Good but not the best, the reason because one star is missing above is lake of home works I've got. Programming is something that you should practice practise and once more practice, otherwise the knowledge you got will disappear soon. So I would suggest to push people even more 2-4 hours and as a minimum double the home works.",4
74412,"The course is well-structured, and the Auto-grader really streamlines the course.I enjoyed Dr. Chuck's explanation and lecturing style very much. I think it is a very good introduction to Python and programming in general.Having said that, I actually already had experience programming with C++ & Java and so it's difficult to provide useful feedback regarding course difficulty.P.S: Love the book!",4
74419,Very Good!,4
74421,"along with the book, a very informative and well paced course",4
74427,"This is a good course for beginners, it tells the details of basic python knowledge. The quiz and assignment are easy to finish, but you can still learn a lot from them. I would like to take the following courses related with python.",4
74458,This course is very useful for anyone who has no programming background,4
74459,A good place to start learning any programming language.,4
74481,"I really found this course useful in understanding some basic concepts of programming, Dr chuk really gave a distilled understanding of these concepts and i think having him as a tutor was really the key.",4
74494,Lessons are easy to follow. Assignments can be a little confusing sometimes but overall they are good at encompassing all that you've learned and building on the previous weeks. I definitely recommend this course to anyone thinking about getting into programming.,4
74497,"A solid beginners course, though the lectures could have been more direct at times.",4
74508,Thorough and logical explanations of programming concepts.,4
74509,good coursei like the interview and good course materials,4
74525,"I enjoyed the instructor teaching but the video and interviews, but not those with Guido van Rossum, were not very interesting and had nothing to do with Python.",4
74534,This is very clear and explains to everyones understanding the workings of python.,4
74550,"Excellent course overall. I very much like Dr. Charles Severence's explanations of the material. He's very methodical and keeps the material interesting.The only gripe that I have is the auto-grader for the code. It is fickle and gives odd errors sometimes, causing a student to dedicate undue time.",4
74554,"it's very good course for beginners, I enjoyed it a lot, i just wished if it would cover more more in one course so i can gain more from the whole specialization.Thanks a lot Professor Charles Severance, I really enjoyed classes.",4
74573,"Perfect for total beginners, a little bit longer for mor eexprerienced developers",4
74589,"This is fairly simple course the introduces students to the world of Python, without requiring any previous programming knowledge. I enjoyed it especially because it was presented in a clear manner, and the quizzes and assignments really made sure that I had understood all the information that was transmitted. I would have liked, however, that the level of complexity was a bit higher.",4
74593,"Excellent material, fabulous tutor, Ι'd really be glad if I could have Professor Severance in real-life class. That's the only reason I do not give a straigth 5star reward, since I believe that the lack of real life interaction is not fully recovered by the quizzes and excercises, they should be more in my opinion. Of course, I understand that this course might also be intented for even a complete amateur and I respect the fact to let this quiz and test part simplified. I will definitely follow the next courses of the Python circle.",4
74602,Good way of teaching,4
74607,a great introductory course. Dr chuck is a great and funny teacher,4
74619,"This course made me feel smart - probably because of the really slooooow way of explaining things.Nevertheless, I found this very helpful, and I really loved assignments.",4
74621,Good introduction to Python. Maybe include Linux in the Install section.,4
74628,Nice basic Course.,4
74637,Very easy to jump in for someone who has never programmed before. A little slow for people who have experience.,4
74638,"my first online course, really friendly for new comers.intresting and informative",4
74648,A great course with nice learning curve and assignments for practicing the concepts,4
74665,"Very informative, clear and concise. Easy to follow and the videos, excersises and the quizes are structured in a great way.",4
74670,These course programs have helped me a lot in my professional growth. I recommed,4
74688,Its good for beginners with no prior programming experiencebut if someones learning python with prior knowledge in any other programming language the course is a piece of cake.,4
74695,It was good,4
74718,i like the way of teaching ....,4
74724,learning new programming language was fun and looking forward to learn more,4
74745,Very nice and easy way to begin learning Python basics.,4
74747,good course every beginner should do it to get basic knowledge of pythonunlike other tutorials it give a problem statement and move forward only when it is completed,4
74753,"Great intro to Python with great lectures , quizzes and assignments.",4
74755,"A great introduction to the Python language, I enjoyed both the book and the instructor",4
74766,"A little time-wasting for those who already have programming experience. Better to read a book or doc.However, it may be great for beginners of coding.",4
74767,Best course to begin your programming with. Kick start the beginning of your new path into programming.,4
74772,Great into course to Python. The assignments tool can be a little buggy sometimes but overall great,4
74782,Good one . Expected more exercise or assignment .,4
74783,It is a good course. Quiz and Assignments are helpful. I have learnt a basic of python programming language. A huge thank you to Dr. Chuck.,4
74798,It is my first course.I had a lovely experience to learn python,4
74809,A little on the easy side but is a great introduction to python,4
74814,"I dunno, is it acceptable from my side ot not, but everything was very easy. It's basics of the basics. I'd like to put 5 stars, because mr. Severence is a nice teacher, but there is some mismamtches is videos and assignments, that looks like carelessness. And, again, very easy material. Will go further.",4
74821,"It is too easy even for beginners, topic about dictionaries would be useful (or is there any second part of the course?). Assignments are too easy to cheat. Lectures are awesome, nothing to add",4
74835,Fairly good and amazing course,4
74837,very nice and pleasant way to get started with python,4
74846,Very good course. The information is passed on effortlessly by the professor and all the study material is very helpful. Definitely recommend it to all who want to learn Python.,4
74850,very convenient to understand and learn.,4
74851,This course has contributed to helping me develop the confidence required to continue,4
74856,"I felt that this course was a bit slow paced and that there was a lot of fluff in the videos. Still, the course covers basic concepts (e.g. variables, conditionals, loops, etc.) of programming well.",4
74857,Great course and great lecturer!,4
74870,Pretty good beginner course but doesn't go deep enough. Hopefully the next courses in the series are more informational.,4
74872,"Well it's good beginners course, but i think you can teach more syntax and tools before heading into Data structures.",4
74876,its wonderful and simple to understand.,4
74896,I thank coursera for this wonderful opportunity.This is a good course for learning basic concepts in python.,4
74899,"I've made solo attempts to learn programming before, so this was all material I had covered (though in a different language.) It was very useful to refresh and solidify the concepts in preparation for the other four classes in the series.",4
74906,Bit basic for people who already know c or any other language but it is still effective,4
74913,I felt there were not enough challenges for the fee.,4
74924,"Very good for beginners. But please improve colors of flowchart, i can't see the text inside the flowcharts.",4
74927,It is a nice course for people who has zero knowledge about programming.,4
74942,"This is a good intro to programming. Its paced well and taught well. I could follow the lessons, but i struggled writing my own programs. I will continue with the series though in hopes I can improve.",4
74944,Basic/beginner python syntax and coding elements. FYI: More work needs to be done to become proficient.,4
74949,Simple and Focused course on Programming and Python.,4
74950,"Useful course, very funny thanks to Charles :)",4
74962,Some of the lectures could be a little more direct. Some of the examples/ exercises could could be more concise. Thanks!,4
74963,It is simply superb,4
74965,tutors made really amazing effort to make such a difficult course to learn easily.,4
74966,"Some of the lectures were a bit too informal to my taste, but still got the messages across",4
74967,For programmer who knows in advance a bit of syntax of python language .This course can be completed in few hours,4
74971,"Great start to programming, really liked it! LIttle pricey given the time length.",4
74980,Professor is very detailed and clear in every lecture. I would highly recommend this class to my peers.,4
74984,A nice course for someone with little experience in programming.,4
74990,Great effort by the team of coursera and Dr. Chuck.I liked the simplicity of the course. Perfect for beginners,4
74994,"Though I had moderate knowledge of coding before hand (arduino, a bit of C++, a bit of JS) this course slid me into the world of Python, and clarified some things I had not known before. Great course, I would recommend to anyone looking to learn Python or coding in general.",4
75007,Very nice introductory course. I recommend it widely,4
75015,great course to learn Python,4
75019,"Very clear, basic and organized course. It could be better to taught in python3 :)",4
75024,"A basic course for python learners, very suitable for those who know little about programming and want to get started.",4
75031,"A bit easy, but a good primer. Looking forward to the rest of them.",4
75035,"适合非计算机专业的人学习，很基础的入门。对于有别的语言编程基础的人来说，安排的课时太长了，自己看估计两天就能看完了。另外，老师挺有意思的。It's good for new programmer while it arranges a too long time for a experienced programmer.By the way,teacher is interesting.",4
75045,Good for starters. Instructor is very good.,4
75048,As a introductory course it's good course. Course material is too easy.,4
75052,a little less functional programming and a lot of theory and quizes related to the programming part. furthermore it is possible to cheat on the programming part to a certain degree,4
75053,"Good beginners course. (I went in with other programming knowledge)Useful for learning basics of python, I worked out of the textbook (5 stars)",4
75058,"Great course to begin your python journey. Assessments were relatively tougher than what instructor teaches, but you're provided with a lot of online self study material. So its a trade-off between the speed of the course and challenging assessments.",4
75060,"Very good for someone just getting started with programming. The pace will be slow for someone with any programming experience, but the material is still useful.",4
75066,"Great intro course. Started off a little slow, but found the final assignment relatively challenging. had some prior Python background and was able to finish this course in 3 weeks. moving on to the next course in the sequence.",4
75074,Great course for the beginner with little or no programming experience. The lectures are well delivered and short allowing them to be watched practically anywhere you have a spare 15 mins!,4
75085,"Pretty good intro, you can kind of use the exact same code on each homework though. So there is not as much learning going on.",4
75089,Very good intro course,4
75090,Good for basic concept and introduction to a programming language,4
75099,A bit simple,4
75103,Quite self sufficient. Easy to follow. Pace is fine but a little bit slow for someone with programming experience in other language.,4
75108,"It was very helpful course, but progress is to slow for my level of knowledge. It is for beginners. If you have some experience this course will be too easy for you.",4
75111,"This course is great for programmer newer, but I just complete this course to get the certificate for the last project.",4
75124,"Very straight-forward and easy to understand, especially for those without coding experience.",4
75134,"This course is great and really suitable for the students who never do the code related things. However, if you are a student who have learned C/java or other software, it maybe too basic for you. By the way, I really like professor Chuck, he vividly illustrate the definition of the computer with humor. I enjoy this course.",4
75140,"professor chuck is very humorous and basically, this course is extremely good for those who haven't learn any programming languages. It is sometimes seen to me that it is a little bit easy. However, the overall is quite perfect!! I love it !",4
75141,"A good course for people with zero programming knowledge, but a little bit slow, a little bit ""baby sitting"" for people with some programming experience.Three star for the course. One more star for access to all the quiz without need to pay!",4
75146,Very nice course.Teaching methodolgy of Doctor chuck is very cool,4
75147,It was a great experience.,4
75156,"I like very much the way for checking the code and the results, I would remove from the course al extra material.",4
75166,"Wonderful open course, the teacher is a very humorous and skillful person, I want to continue the next!!!!",4
75168,"The course is well structured and has good information and worthwhile assignments. However, it is really geared toward people who have little to no programming experience, not to people who know other languages but have little to no programming experience in Python.",4
75171,This is a good course to start on Python for beginner.,4
75186,very effective!!!,4
75191,"Good beginner course. Professor is cool and makes it easy to get started with python. Looking forward to taking the next courses in this series. If you already know the basics of python/programming, you will be bored in this course.",4
75194,good courser well presented for beginners,4
75215,"Great intro to python, thanks.",4
75219,it was pretty good for the beginners and i have a nice experience...,4
75255,"Course is great, instructor is also great. For basics of python its a great a course. But i felt that content is less and would have added more content",4
75258,Course was pretty good. Went well,4
75263,"Its good for someone not from an IT or CS background as it covers basics, but otherwise its too basic.I loved the course as this is first time I'm actually trying to study online else I generally preferred physical books.",4
75267,"Takes a bit of time to get into the nuance of Python if familiar with coding, but ultimately as advertised.",4
75269,it's really helping and useful...:),4
75272,Very nice way of leaning Python programming for beginners !!!!!,4
75291,"This is a great class! It makes Python (and coding) approachable for people like me, who want to learn how to code but have absolutely no experience.",4
75294,just some basic things,4
75297,I'm almost done with the course and really enjoyed everything so far. However please do invest some time to update the course for Python 3. Professor is great and really holds you by the hand; exactly the kind of teaching I needed.,4
75309,It seems to simple although considering that it is for new programmer.,4
75318,"Well structured! In the HTML version of the book are some type errors (escaped characters), please correct them to help others. Thanks!",4
75324,Good course for startup .,4
75327,"It started very very slow, I guess that's good for really really beginners. I've never programmed before, but I am a excel heavy user so the first logics are kind of the same. The last 2 weeks were pretty interesting and I can't wait to start next course!",4
75332,Really clear and well done,4
75339,"A very interesting and clear intro course to learn Python. The textbook is really easy to understand, so as the online lecture!",4
75346,7 weeks done in a day ... this was REALLY for beginners. You might want to highlight it a little more.Let's see the next one !,4
75347,Very good for beginners. People who doesn't know anything about programming will be able to learn fast.,4
75360,"this course is very easy for those who have learnt c and c++ ,and knowing c and c++ made me learn this course very very very easily .And thank you chuck you explain things good",4
75372,Great introductory course.,4
75375,Good introductory course,4
75376,Very nice but must have included more videos and explained the course in depth.,4
75380,Wonderful forum to learn!! Kudos to team.,4
75386,Nice course. I got basic information from this course.,4
75388,"This course is good for me, but I think you should give more exercises for each structure. Thank for your course.",4
75391,very helpful to people who are new to programming world,4
75400,"There should have been more exercises on loops, especially definite ones. We had a couple of exercises on infinite loops but none on definite. Also, there should be a way to practice the code along with Chuck as he gives examples using a short & quick code for more practice. Something like a smaller version of the code tool could be right there along side the video. That would help. Thanks.",4
75407,"There is more work that what the videos show, but the book and the curated notes are more than sufficient",4
75433,This was my first coursera course and it was great! Thanks!,4
75444,Great course. Parts move a little slowly. That can be mitigated by fast forwarding through parts of the videos.,4
75455,"Very great idea! This is the era of internet and communication and in this way I believe that you are making a great contribution to the educational equality. As it is for this specific computer language (python) as it is a free source program.Thanks, Amir Reza Fahami",4
75459,"highly informational from python perspective, but really basic coding concepts were discussed using python. Was looking for some more advanced concepts. All in All a great course. Cheers :)",4
75460,I understand the basic op the python language.,4
75461,Its really a nice for beginners in python,4
75464,Really good for beginner. Very clear and professor is very humurous.,4
75483,"Overall a good course. It woud be great if there were optional ""assignments"" (or just extra assignments) that provide more practice coding. True, we can do this on our own, but it is useful to be guided through assignments toward developing smart code that provides the desired result.",4
75491,Brilliant Class for Beginners,4
75500,Great coaching by Dr. Severance and also interactive exams and coding tool.,4
75504,Good course. Only I would like to suggest that after a quiz is submitted there should be an option to see what the correct answers were,4
75505,Great course and awesome lecturer.Only thing I felt missing is more exercises.,4
75511,this is good.,4
75522,"pretty good, wish it had more excercises and more content",4
75524,This is my first certification i am doing. I known this website through my friend. i found it very useful for me. i have learned a new type of learning thanks to Mr.Charles Severance,4
75535,"It is a great course for begginers, even if you do not have any programming background.",4
75554,Good start if you are new to Python,4
75558,Best course. Very easy to learn new language with this course.,4
75570,"Overall, a very good course. For the vast majority of it, I felt that information was explained carefully and there was a good balance of challenge and support.",4
75571,Good for the beginners to programming,4
75580,"In my view, this course may be too simple. but it makes sense for any beginner.",4
75584,This course is really inspiring and intresting too and the main is the teaching aids of Dr. Chuck and his friendly behaviour make too curios about the course material all about a good course.,4
75604,Very nice learning experience. Everything was being taught from scratch. Loved it!! :),4
75609,Good for someone just start learning Python,4
75615,GOOD COURSE! CLEAR AND WELL ORGANIZED!!!,4
75635,My first coding program online,4
75636,"very interesting and challenging, though the mentors were very quick to respond to queries! thank you.",4
75650,The first 2 weeks become kind of boring and instead of motivating. Rest is easy to understand but still covers only very basics.,4
75655,Nice course but you need to be patient while doing the exercise.,4
75656,It was good but sometimes I was thinking that some of the aspects could be explained quicker.,4
75657,I was hoping to get more on function and array based operations in the tasks.But all in all it's great!,4
75659,Nice for basics,4
75663,"Thank you very much for the course. It was interesting and useful but, to my mind, there were too many repeated explanations of the same things (even for me, a person who has never done anything like programming).",4
75664,great course,4
75676,Thans to Chuch and all the staff of the Coursera Team.,4
75677,It was a very satisfying experience. Looking forward to learn more. It would have been better if all the courses had been available for free.,4
75680,"Good introduction to Python, it gets you into the mindset of programming and combining syntax to do something useful. The videos could be more to the point and better quality though.",4
75683,Very easy to follow instructions and the structure of the course is very conducive for anyone who has interest to learn programming.,4
75686,good one to start with,4
75688,It will be nice to add some more extra exercises with a complete guide in the wiki section.,4
75693,"Professor is clear, interesting and enjoyable to listen to. Learned a lot, the class can definitely be completed within a week but he is concise. Star taken off due to lack of serious challenge but I would definitely recommend this to someone learning programming for the first time!!",4
75694,fundamental and useful class!,4
75712,Dr. Chuck is awesome!,4
75717,Its simply great!!!!!,4
75725,very good course actually!,4
75727,Godd introduction to Python. I enjoyed the course in full.,4
75739,Great learning and a great course for beginners,4
75747,"Great tempo, explanations, and exercises....To give 5 starts, I would have liked more assignments.",4
75749,"Nice and well structured class. I liked it to learn the basic Python syntax (loops, functions etc.), before you get to data structures in the second class. At first, that was counter-intuitive to me, since in other courses on different programming languages, it was the other way around, but it worked quite nicely. The only weakness of the class: In the assignments where you have to enter your code to get a specific output, just getting the output was not enough. A more or less concrete code was required. It was sometimes a bit frustrating to figure out what went wrong. But anyhow: A good course for anyone with little programming experience and a wish to learn Python!",4
75756,"really great course for beginners,for the people who have already learnt programming it's a great recap!",4
75758,Great course to begin with. It surely will incline your interest in programming.,4
75773,very basic course. Easy for a bit experienced programmers but I know this is meant for someone who is just starting out,4
75776,Very good course for the beginners.,4
75798,Well structured course with nice-to-know backround information about hardware. The bonus material (interviews with some of the people who had great impact on programming) is fun to watch and shares the spirit of open source.,4
75803,Very good for beginners.,4
75805,Nice introducing to python^),4
75807,very good and useful,4
75809,"Very good course, easy to follow. It would be nice to see the code also in Python 3.",4
75818,Great course! Could be improved with more practical exercises.,4
75820,This is really a starter's course and helps out people like me who have zero coding background make first step into the world of coding/data.,4
75821,it's a really good course for the people who have totally no background of programming.,4
75824,Thanks A Ton...,4
75826,It's a great course,4
75836,very good course for bigginers,4
75846,This was a good intro to programming for sure! The book is very clear and concise. There could have been more information provided each week.,4
75857,Gives an an overall idea about python programming.,4
75865,Great for absolute beginners.,4
75870,"Assignments are really very usefull,and the videos are clearly understandable it can be of more depth",4
75872,Well thought out sequencing of covered topics. Decent incorporation of learned capabilities in subsequent exercises.,4
75883,A nice course for beginners. And what's better than get a certificate from one of top Universities in the world! :),4
75885,"Good introductory course and easy to understand, can be completed within 2 days.",4
75888,"Good introductory course. I enjoyed learning the basics of the Python computer language. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because the class information was not presented 100% clearly. It was not very clear where to access the book, or what readings corresponded to which lectures. Otherwise a great class.",4
75902,"This is an excellent course about beginning of python programming, I recommend to take it, the material is clear and you can repeat the videos every time that you need.",4
75909,This course progresses extremely slowly but it covers the material as advertised. I recommend this to absolute programming beginners.,4
75918,Good introductory course. Probably add more (optional) exercises to help get practise.,4
75924,A very good introduction to python,4
75925,Great course!,4
75926,So far the course has been amazing!,4
75927,"Quite python basics.If you have learned other programming languages,you just need 2-5 hours to complete this course.Anyway,it is a good start for learning python.",4
75934,As for me too much water. I'd like to have this course shorter and faster,4
75935,A great course for newer.,4
75944,"Excellent introduction to programming Python. The course layout, pace and instruction are well done.",4
75950,"Nice, but for totally new programmers.",4
75954,"It really is python for EVERYBODY, was a bit too simple for me. With very little python experience I completed all assignments in 2 days.",4
75959,Makes programming not so scary. This is a great class for those that fear programming like me. Wish there were more exercises with solutions though so I could test myself some more.,4
75960,It was a good class for someone without any programming experience. The lectures really helped me to start understanding python language (and programming basic logic in general). However the course load is light and the pace is quite slow.,4
75970,perfect start to learn python.but it could have made even better instead of dragging the lecture,4
75972,Wish they had more assignments to test you.,4
75973,"Easy and interesting, but the content is a little bit thin..",4
75975,"The course is great so far. However, i'm facing technical issues with the auto-grader and with using the phython tool online.",4
75984,In this course i get the basic knowledge of Python. I enjoy this course very much!,4
75989,"fun, informatics, but some key points wasn't t",4
76011,Really enjoyed the classes and Professor Chuck teaching method is fun as well as efficient!,4
76027,Too easy,4
76034,"The course itself is wonderful,very instructive, well organized, and easy to understand. My only ""complaint"" is that it is too simple. That being said, this course is the fundamental of the fundamental of python. Mastering this sole course is far below enough to wield python as a powerful data analyzing tool. Also, I think even though this is designed to be an intro course, for people like me who is a total rookie in the world of computer science, it should have mentioned, at least touched upon a little of what is algorithm, because there is no way we won't come across various algorithms in the future of learning computer science. I just think it'd be good to have a heads-up.",4
76051,good introductory of python.,4
76070,This course was amazing!!I previously had taken Python course from other university from an other website.It was very difficult and lost interest since it was first time I was dealing with python and the difficulty level was too much for a fresher to Python. But this was easy yet interesting as well :) and I am very happyThank you Charles Sir !!! :),4
76082,"assignment is a bit too easy, suitable for totally new beginners",4
76092,Great for getting to know not only about python but about overall programming too!,4
76095,Slow paced.,4
76096,"Goes over the fundamental basics of programming quite well.One area for improvement would be more exercises and assignments. Students at this stage in beginning programming could always use more smaller exercises to solidify knowledge. Although it would seem pointless to experienced programmers coming from other languages, I think it would benefit beginners.",4
76109,Good to start off newly. But I think an certificate of completion must have been issued after completing the course for those taking the free course,4
76113,Very Illustrative and useful specially for beginners to programming.,4
76121,Very good course for starters...,4
76131,Good courser to get started with the basics of programming and from here spring board to other areas.,4
76143,Toooo easy,4
76146,Well structured for the starting in python.,4
76157,"For these who major in computer science in university, this course can be kind of easy. But it's really acceptable for those who have no experience with programming. It can be a good way to get started with Python.",4
76188,"beautifully taught :) thank you Sir. Also, if there were more assignments it would have been even better.",4
76194,Very good for beginners but if you have prior experience in programming. this course is NOT for you,4
76204,i am very happy when I completed this course. thank you to Coursera <3,4
76215,Great introduction to python.A bit long if coming from other languages but still useful.,4
76217,one for newbie,4
76218,I enjoyed this course. I was a good introduction to Python. The videos and material are easy to understand. I look forward to taking the other courses in this specialization.,4
76225,Easy to follow and well informed assignments to try on first go !!!!,4
76226,"good for novice programmer,an experienced programmer may leave it",4
76227,"Good Course for beginners,although students with little coding experience will find this course a little slow.",4
76232,"It's really for people without any programming background. To me, as an experienced programmer, it's not concise enough.",4
76246,I think it could have been more challenging and have had more material. There was too much introductory material in the first two weeks.,4
76259,"Basic course, if you already have programming notions, this course might not be necessary. The teacher is very good and good exercises.",4
76264,Great course! Really easy to understand for beginners! Thanks..,4
76271,Breaks down material in an easy to understand manner and makes effective use of technology to administer exams and assignments.,4
76272,"a very very nice course made by a funny and good teacher, the course will help you step by step on learning the basics of python by showing you explanations followed by a quiz (not really hard but very useful for the purpouse of helping the user to remember the lessons) and then by a proper exercise, the only thing i would add it would be a specific lesson on punctuation and syntax of the python lenguage becouse a couple of time i've been struggling with exercises and the problem were indentations and some punctuation. Thank you a lot mr. Chuck, coursera and the community!",4
76278,Wonderful course for a python beginner. Thanks for the course!,4
76280,Very easy to understand. Great for everyone,4
76281,"Quite good, sometimes the lecture slides spent a little too much time on explaining a basic concept. For example, it probably isn't necessary to repeatedly explain a loop iterating 5 times until the end of the loop. But otherwise the course cleared up a few things that I was having a hard time wrapping my head around with a different crash course I took in another class.",4
76287,"It's very basic, suitable for beginners.",4
76292,good course to start with the python..!,4
76297,a good course,4
76305,"You won't snooze, this I can promise. Professor Charles does everything one possibly can to make the lectures interesting and still manages who get across all the important stuff. It was a great learning experience for me. It's especially good if you don't have a lot of time to learn this language.",4
76323,Excellent intro to python. I learned the basics and I believe that future classes can enhance my execution of Python for data science.,4
76325,i liked the professor thank you very much ^_^,4
76327,A very good introduction to programming for the beginners. I really appreciated it!,4
76341,Good course for starters,4
76343,Dr. Chuck is exceptionally talented. The entire course was very engaging and a fruitful learning experience. Definitely would recommend this course for beginners.,4
76354,Very expensive certificate for little material.,4
76358,"slightly slow and not hugely thorough, but very practical.",4
76362,Just scratches the surface. Good to get started for absolute beginners.,4
76363,Good for beginners with little or no knowledge of Python or programing.,4
76372,"Enjoyed, enjoyed the insights from lecturer and bonus interviews. Content all had purpose.",4
76379,quite easy. you can finish this course in 4 hours.,4
76385,"This is a good class, and I got very usedthanks Dr. chuk and university of Michigan",4
76404,"This is an excellent course for a complete newcomer to programming and the professor has taken great care to address the newcomers. However, I would advise anybody with any programming experience to not take the course. If you have a non python programming background and are learning python, then you can quickly learn some syntax, do all the assignments and clear the course.",4
76410,the last exercise is bugged (5.2 is supposed to be 5.1),4
76415,It was really useful and it was really for a beginner. Now i can explore more in Python. Assignments were useful.,4
76418,Please include Object-oriented programming.,4
76420,It was a great course.,4
76442,Could be a little bit more complex,4
76451,Nice course for the beginners.Go for It.,4
76457,"Generally a very good course. Some of the very simple things seemed to be explained in far more detail than necessary, but then other more difficult area, were breezed through rapidly. Although of course it is always possible to track back through the videos or pause them until you've got your head round it.",4
76461,Good beginner course! For the content is not so intimidating for beginner to chicken out half-way. Thumbs up!,4
76462,"Could do better with explaining in a better way, but overall is very good.",4
76486,"Chuck is a very interesting lecturer and the material is very good, although the course is a little bit too trivial.",4
76489,Very good and informative cours! Helps you to understand basic language elements and provide you an opportunity to further progression in future.,4
76495,"Very detailed, but not deep enough ha. Anyway, a good class!",4
76499,"This is the the one of the best course for beginner to learn programming easy ,",4
76502,Too easy for my opinion,4
76503,Good Introduction for beginners,4
76504,"The course is very useful as a good overview to programming with Python and a quick look at some of the basic functions. Is a good introduction for the later Python courses in the series. The first few lectures are a very general introduction to programming as a concept rather than Python specifically so can be skimmed over if you're not completely new to the concept. Overall, a good introduction to the topic.",4
76511,Prof is cool. A good platform to start programming.,4
76512,"While the videos are a good guide, the quizzes and assignments are way too easy. I find that, whenever I am studying, finding out how to do difficult exercises are the best way to really learn.Good course",4
76521,"Cool, easy stuff",4
76525,"Easy to follow, and the Dr Chuck is quite interesting. However, the pace is a little slow. Still a good course, though.",4
76526,"Very nice professor, liked him very much. My favorite thing about the course.",4
76538,"The lectures are very good. But the Discussion forum became a ""hidden question - mistic answer"" panel lately. Could we get some non-scored assignments to discuss them openly with mentors and to learn more ?",4
76539,I think sometimes it got very confusing some of the examples being the exact same from chapter to chapter. It was nice having a ground for it but i started to question why would you use this method instead of the one we used before for hours and rate specifically.,4
76541,"Dr. Severance put in lot of efforts to make python easy for all the learners.This Course is about the basics of python. If you are a beginner, you will learn a lot of concepts very easily. For people who have a bit of programming knowledge in other languages, this will help in learning the syntax.Overall a good course to go through.",4
76542,"Good, but wish it went more in depth in lectures.",4
76552,Very apt content and the explanation was in simple words and to the point.,4
76561,a good course that uses a variety of tools for better learning,4
76571,"it is so good, the teachers can transmit the knowledge required",4
76573,"I recommend this class especially for beginners. If you are good with coding in other languages and want to learn Python you can skip to chapter 3 or 4. If you are new to computers and how programming works, I definitely recommend watching all the courses. (My experiences based)",4
76576,It was very informative. I loved the way you taught us about programming.,4
76586,As a beginner course it's okay.Needs to be more competitive and tough.,4
76587,"This course is a little boring for someone who has learned C or Java or any language before, however, it is really a good one for beginners, whether you love Python or just want to learn programming through one language.",4
76591,"Very very basic intro course... Great for students new to programming without a C, C++ background",4
76592,Superb!! I love the lessons :),4
76602,very good lectures and even fun. the tool is extremely useful.more feedback and assistance would generally improve the quality,4
76603,Really very good but basic introduction to the Python programming language.,4
76604,its a really nice course and of course i love the lecturer... Mr Charles,4
76607,"very interesting, easy to learn though you might have challenges if you are new to programming. but its not bad at all, try it!",4
76610,A very good beginner course. The teacher explains everything clearly and thoroughly.,4
76613,Good Intro course!,4
76630,It's a great start!,4
76651,"A very good introduction to the material, though a bit simplistic.",4
76655,I wish it was a little faster in the pace.,4
76657,"Some explanations are a bit redundant and stretched out, but overall a wonderful course, great teacher and interesting matierial",4
76660,"Great primer for understanding the very basics of Python. You won't be able to make too much fancy stuff after this, but it's a stepping stone to great things.Dr. Chuck is a great teacher and the exercises are challenging and fun.",4
76662,right course for beginners,4
76667,"a very good introduction ""for anybody"".",4
76676,"A very good course for beginners, especially those who have not programmed anything before.If you have prior experience in programming and not aiming for the Specialization, you can just skip ahead ;)Just one note: if you're really enthusiastic, all the content here won't be enough for you!",4
76687,very nicely explained basics of python ...,4
76691,"The course is a very good one for beginners in both programming and Python.The teacher is engaging and easily understood, and the material is good.The course could do with a more systematized ""homework"" system in addition to the quizzes and assessments, but a well-organized student has all the elements to do additional work by himself if needed.",4
76698,Great Course really. Good material and easy to follow and understand.,4
76699,Basic introduction to Python. With my level of understanding I wish I had skipped this and gone straight to the second course in the series...,4
76704,Great Course!,4
76712,"Simple, easy introductory course. This is just the beginning. You should at least take the next two courses in the Python for Everybody Specialization to learn at least 90% of the language.",4
76717,It's great for beginners but VERY easy for advanced programmers,4
76718,This is an excellent course. The instructor explains the concepts very well and they are easy to understand. The course and program could benefit from office hours like google Hangout sessions where we can interact with people.,4
76725,"Great course for beginning, but I fell like it needs more exercises.",4
76743,very good course!!,4
76748,Nice introduction to Python but might be a bot too basis for those already familiar with Python.,4
76756,Sir is an amazing teacher and expresses his ideas very clearly,4
76762,Its a great course ......highly recommended,4
76777,Ease of Learning,4
76781,Interesting and Interactive,4
76787,easy and good,4
76797,"really good, great for beginners, need to get rid of slides with white text on green background",4
76800,The course is amazing for beginners. Dr. Chuck makes the material super easy and very approachable. Definitely recommended for anyone who intends to take the first steps on the programming road.,4
76817,"Very good course, perfect for beginners. I had some previous knowledge so found it a little slow, but just powered on with the python informatics, which has a better pace than the course. I'll probably rely more on the course videos going forward though as I venture deeper in to the language.",4
76819,"I hope some important data structures such as pointer, 2 dimensional array, etc. can be added to this course.",4
76820,Basic Course. Not tough,4
76824,"Easy to follow. The videos tie back to the book, this gives you the option of digesting the information on multiple ways.Pace could be a bit faster, but this program is flexible so you can complete it earlier if you want to.",4
76833,"Video lectures could be a little bit shorter by cutting basic explanations, for example, don't need to go thru the whole list oz numbers to see that each of them is smaller or larger.",4
76849,"Videos are dated and have some errors, but otherwise great course!",4
76850,a little bit slow,4
76862,"Good basic introduction to Python. The course should be easy to understand and follow even if you are not a programmer. To top it all Chuck is an amazing teacher full or energy, enthusiasm and knowledge. His love for Python is seen in each and every chapter. I am glad that I took this course on Coursera. Will definitely recommend this to others. Would love to take the advanced part of the course soon.",4
76874,Good Course but it needs some getting in-depth.,4
76876,"Great course to start programming, sometimes a bit slow though.",4
76877,"A great (and gentle) introduction or review of fundamental concepts in Python programming and basic computer science. The lectures are clear and the assignments are relevant/well-designed.This course series is second only to MITx 6.00.1x over at edX, which is considerably more challenging, time-consuming, and somewhat better executed. The code grader for the MIT course test a wide array of cases to ensure that the student has minimal leeway in terms of shortcuts while one could easily fool the auto-grader in this course. The assignments also lack depth and challenge compared to the MIT assignments.Overall, the course is well organized and a great option for beginners.",4
76885,Very good to start learning Python. More exercices would be great.,4
76890,A good introdution to python,4
76891,"Course is really nice, interactive and informative.It would have been really nice if this course include some bigger project which require all the things that have been taught in one problem to accomplish it.",4
76899,Easy to start the journey of learning python.,4
76910,A fair approach to programming basics. A couple of funny videos as well. Certain topics are a little bit over discussed. Liked the assignments although those could be a little bit more difficult to complete,4
76921,"This course, as its name suggests is for anyone including people who have no previous background in programming. One can skip parts based on her experience. Having some experience in programming, I still found it useful. It gives the basics of the language, syntax, what happens when we interact with a computer etc. The instructor was well prepared not only in terms of content but also it is obvious he cares about things like teaching at scale. I also liked he gave credit to everyone who helped him to prepare for the course. I suggest this to anyone who wants to learn python, based on ones experience and dedication, completing all the content can take down to 1-2 days.",4
76931,Great course for beginners in programming. Looking forward to the second of the series of Python specialization course.,4
76934,Very nice introduction to Python,4
76936,clear and simple explanationvery good for beginner like me,4
76947,"Great as a first introduction to Python. However, if you have any prior programming experience, this course is most likely to be way too easy for you.",4
76952,Excellent Introduction to Python and computer programming language,4
76956,Great learning Course,4
76977,"Great introduction to Python (although, I knew it before, so I may have an advantage), I give it 4/5 stars only because it ignored Python 3, which is what most of the industry does anyhow, but it is still worth noticing.Plus, the way that many firms work, they just look for keywords, so putting both Python 2 an Python 3 on a resume would help.That being said, the course encourages doing derived courses to help others learn programming and gain mastery over ""dumb but fast"" computer systems, and I wholly support that attitude.So just for that, I would give it more than five stars out of the ""possible"" five, because programming allows one to expand what is possible, beyond past limits and systems.",4
76980,"I recommend this course to those who totally do not have any experience in programming. Otherwise, it is too simply to follow the lecture step by step. All the programming language are quite similar at the first beginning, like matlab or C++.",4
76986,"Very basic but good for people who don't have any prior programming experience,",4
76990,Excellent course. I have a minor gripe that the lectures were almost verbatim repeats of the course textbook which itself was very useful. Looking forward to the next course already.,4
76993,"Very nice course for beginners.If there is some experience with other programming languages it can easily be absolved in 1/2 days, while not rushing through.",4
77002,Best teacher around!!! :),4
77012,"Course is great, but the platforms has some bugs, which is very annoying when you are completing tasks.",4
77013,The course is easy and clear. For beginner programmers.,4
77015,Nice beginner course!,4
77022,Excellent introduction to the Python language. Looking forward to apply what I have learnt.,4
77030,Excellent course for beginners.Thanks,4
77033,"As someone with no introduction to programming at all, this course was easy to follow through and was a pretty good introductory course!",4
77043,very good course.,4
77054,Incredible...,4
77056,"A bit easier if you know a bit about programming, pretty recommended if you know nothing.",4
77068,Good course for introducing in Python,4
77077,Good course and intro to Python. Coupled with Codeacademy.com it has been fairly easy.,4
77080,Very basic level but the professor manages to keep lectures interesting and later courses get more challenging and useful.,4
77082,Prof is really great but the course is very elementary if you have programming experience with any of the previous language you can read the book suggested by the Prof and skip this course,4
77096,"I like it very much, I only had very basic knowledge on programming and still it was easy, could have gone a bit faster in some parts.",4
77098,Great course. I like a lot.,4
77108,"An excellent introduction to programming.If you're already a programmer, you will find this class much too slow.",4
77111,"A bit too easy for a person who has used python a bit before. Otherwise, fun and interesting.",4
77115,This is a very good course I swear. Very practical and good explanations from the teacher. Thank you,4
77117,Great course for novices. If you have coded in a structured language in the past this course seems a little slow but still a good revision.,4
77118,Overall the course was fantastic. Teaching was spot on and the methods was brilliant. I only have one issue with this course and that's how it uses an auto grader. In my opinion they aren't that great because it only checks for valid input/outputs and not that you understand what it is you're doing. Other courses I've done expect work to be submitted and peer assessed so you can see how other people reach their answers and learn more from that experience.That said though anyone looking to get into computing I would recommend doing this course.,4
77123,Very good teaching from a nice professor!,4
77131,Loved the assignments and the quizzes.,4
77152,Enjoyed the course with python which was easy and doable.,4
77156,"is a Great course for those who want to start to learn the language, even if this is your first computer language. (excuse my poor english, i'm learning it too)",4
77157,Very good and step-by-step as NKOTB would state.,4
77159,This is quite good to learn basic,4
77160,Great course. Really enjoyed learning Python fundamentals. More exercises should be included as part of assignment. Thanks!,4
77161,"This course is very good for the beginner and intermediate person that wants to learn or refresh their skills in programming. i first learned programmer in college (17 years ago) using FORTRAN. I had to learn it in semester; this course provides an interesting format and instruction (Dr. Chuck is a good teacher). This first course gives you a little back ground and it gets you started with the process of programming. I would have given the course a 5 star, but i found the book a challenge to follow for a beginner. I fumbled my way through it. only because of my past experience with FORTRAN programming.",4
77163,Good for anyone who's a beginner. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
77170,Pretty easy,4
77187,"Excellent explanations, great ways to learn and pratice what you have learned.",4
77191,"Good thing, should be promoted",4
77195,good for fresh programmer,4
77203,"Some of the coding exercises have mistakes in them. Other than that, a great course for beginners.",4
77209,wonderful course,4
77216,I felt unprepared for Exercise 5.2. Otherwise good.,4
77239,"Great Work by Coursera Team and University of Michigan , Looking forward to complete entire specialisation course...",4
77240,Great course!,4
77272,basic course for beginner,4
77279,Great course for beginers,4
77281,"I really liked this course but I think it was too soft, I mean, I think we spent a lot of time talking about of algorithmia like loops and so on, and these concepts are universal to all programming languages. Instead of it, we could spend more time, talking about python syntax.Nonetheless I enjoied learn python with you.",4
77294,"The first python lesson I have finished. It is quite simple. The certified fee is too expensive comparing the information in the class. Anyway, I like this class and the teacher. It is a quite good journey till now.",4
77300,"It's too easy! I know this is a beginner course, but in my opinion, it's too easy and slowly.",4
77301,Great introductory course for programming in general (if you're familiar with other languages you should skip a few videos).,4
77316,This is my first experience with an online training program. I found that the way the course to be very well structures and well documented to allow for learning and assimilatopn of the subject. Dr Charles make this stimulating and motivating to go deeper and make the whole thing fun and productive.,4
77330,It is a good course for the people who are new to programming. The instructor is really intuitive and engaging.,4
77335,"Good material and funny professor makes it easy. However, assignments are a bit too easy.",4
77339,It's simple but useful for someone who didn't study computer before this class.,4
77395,I want to thank Sir Charles for thi great Python course.I've learned a lot and I will continue with the next Python courses! Thanks a lot!,4
77406,It's very helpful for the people want to pick up his first language! A great course.But for the folks who have studied some other language it's might be little bit too easy and not content-intensified.,4
77418,Good course for begginers but quite boring for those who know programming in language other than python,4
77436,"I really enjoyed this course and felt like I actually learned the material. The only reason I didn't give this course 5 stars, is that due to the issue of giving away the answers to quiz questions, there were a couple of quiz questions that I couldn't understand and unfortunately still don't. I think this is an area that could be improved.",4
77446,Good for beginner. Very easy to follow.,4
77447,Helps me to start off learning another new programming language. Provides me an alternative perspective when approaching problems at work.,4
77451,for beginners is wary good :),4
77461,Good introduction to the material.,4
77476,a good course for introduction. Too simple and too little exercise.,4
77478,Basics are explained in layman terms. Good start point for Python I think.,4
77485,"Despite being slow and the tutor being a tad too gregarious (though I like it), the course really sets a fine foundation for late entrants to coding world. The examples used are often simple or even silly (they do come with that disclaimer) but they make a point to encourage you to try harder stuff on your own. I suggest you try out your own little codes before attempting the session end assignments.",4
77501,Very good one... want to have this quality more :D,4
77516,Very good but for the future I would suggest more interaction with mentors or teachers... maybe one hour Skype class per week for Q&A,4
77523,"An good introduction to Python geared towards people without programming experience.If you already have a good programming experience the only interesting thing of interest will be the syntax, but that's just a fraction of the video's time. You will probably start skipping forward on the basic ideas of how computers work and lessons will take just the time to listen to the videos and you probably will be able to finish a couple of lessons in one evening, instead of a week.I really appreciated the extra videos that give some background on the history behind programming.At the end of this course you will have a basic idea of how a computer works and how you can instruct it to do still very basic things.",4
77536,A little too easy.,4
77542,"Love this course, not only for learning Python, but also for the start programmers! The instructor just made the programming so easy",4
77546,Very good lecture but the lecturer really can be precised.,4
77549,"While the videos are optional the virtual office hours are unnecessary. If the instructor were to film some of the q&a at these sessions they would be a nice addition, but as is we watch a few minutes of people introducing themselves in a foreign country.Overall nice course.",4
77558,Really good study and practical materials I really liked it.It would've been better if the autograder works correctly .!,4
77565,"Sometimes a little bit repetitive, but maybe it is for better understanding.",4
77579,"Very nice introduction but maybe a bit too verbose. The material could be covered within 1 week, instead of 7.",4
77584,Some more auto graded coding exercises would be very helpful.Thank you for the course!,4
77588,"Okay, the course has too many extra things not required.",4
77601,Really great for beginners or people who want to clear their programming basics.,4
77602,Feel the instructor is good but sometimes is difficult to follow his lectures.,4
77607,quit good but too easy,4
77609,"python for everybody is literally for everybody! i loved the way prof. severance conducted this class with humor and enthusiasm.though a background in c helped me grasp python quickly,i would recommend people to consider taking this course if they wish to learn python.",4
77611,"The professor is nice, but it is a little bit easy.",4
77614,An easy and interesting introduction... but thing go very slowly if if already have few knowledge about programming.,4
77620,"Very, very basic but excellent instruction in the fundamentals.",4
77625,First part - relatively easy but escalates quickly,4
77642,I would like to have more assignment added to this course.,4
77644,"too easy, save us us much time to learn it.beside this, it is also a good experience because it has many bonus about the background of the development of Python.",4
77648,Excellent technique to clear up basics of programming and how the code works at the system level.,4
77650,"I feel there could have been more assignments (and perhaps ones that start from scratch). I personally felt having more [forced] practice would be good. As we only wrote code to apply each concept maybe once, and even these applications were already half worked out for us.",4
77651,"I liked the course. It really is a true beginners' class. I think the instructor taught well with good examples illustrating each point. I deducted a point because the exercises were too easy and there weren't enough of them. I understand that it's not easy to come up with a good grading system, but the grading system definitely could be better.",4
77652,a easy one.,4
77665,Good lectures. Everything is very clear. The pace could be a little faster.,4
77670,"good for beginner, not difficult to start",4
77672,"From the scratch, thank you professor for teaching me Python,",4
77679,"Full of useful information and easy to follow, the concepts are well explained.",4
77683,excelent. complete information and good teacher.,4
77687,Good Course,4
77702,Great course for a Python beginner !!,4
77705,Very nice course and Dr. Chuck has a way that is making complex things seems so easy.,4
77711,this course is very basic course for python and assignments are good.,4
77712,The programming assignments need to be more challenging and have more variety.,4
77713,"Awesome course! My only critic is that I would have hoped to be challenged a little more. Although I do have rather extensive knowledge in programming prior to actually taking the course, just took it for a refresher. It refreshed me wonderfully. The instructor was fantastic and I would recommend to another user. Thanks!",4
77714,"Really good course, very clear and well put together. If you have some previous coding experience, you might find the pace a bit slow, but the slides are very good also and it's really great that Dr Chuck has made the textbook freely available.",4
77719,it's too long sentence to verification and we need to write it again,4
77721,"More coding exercises, as optional for example, would be nice. Otherwise good course and guide videos.",4
77726,Real Basics of programming ...,4
77728,Great for learning python basics,4
77730,This is an amazing course to turn up with.,4
77746,Its an excellent course.. I am really thankful for the approach..,4
77752,"Good for beginners to programming. A bit slow if you already know programming, and just want to learn Python.",4
77753,Like the style of the professor and his really cool tea cup :P . Good start for any one. First time ever completed a coursera course . Cheers for me :),4
77759,Had a very nice time learning Python and got a lot out of this course. Would definitely recommend for beginners.,4
77760,good for start,4
77764,thanks a lot,4
77785,very interesting and easy to understand,4
77791,"Course doesn't go into details, but gives you enough tools to learn your way through with some references other than the course book.",4
77792,I enjoyed this course and it was a very good introduction to Python. The free textbook associated with the course is a great reference also.,4
77797,Very clear explanation about Python. I will like an up,4
77799,"I am currently learning Python from few other sources. I recommend this course for beginners with no or minimum coding experience. The course structure is helping me to gradually gain more understanding of Python. Personally, I like the last assignment because it taught me that the solution is sometimes simpler than we thought. It is just that I think as human rather than how computer would think.Dr Chuck and mentors are helpful and encouraging. I would definitely sign up for part 2 of the course.",4
77805,the professor is cute!!,4
77810,"Solid class, enjoyable and well suited for beginners.",4
77814,Well this course is remarkable and helps me to refer each and every module of this course so thoroughly. Thank you again Sir,4
77817,"Chuck is an entertaining, very knowledgeable guy and this course is great. The exercises aren't always as clear as I would like. Maybe more comments in the code presented in the exercises themselves could help clarify. I have and would recommend this course to anyone interested in coding.",4
77819,This is very good and understandable course. I specially thanks to Professor who explain each thing in very expressive manner and assignments are too good. Thanks for the developers and Coursera which give me this opportunity.,4
77820,Too easy,4
77823,"It is very good for beginners. Material and ""Bonus "" Videos were adding more information to the course.",4
77830,Fabulous teacher....,4
77835,Good course.,4
77842,Excellent course! Everyone should take this course and try their hands on a great programming language -Python,4
77847,Wonderful learning experience,4
77849,Great course. The teacher is the best! I really mean it.,4
77851,"Just finished the course ""a little bit"" ahead of February.Would have been a resounding five-star review but some ""mentor"" thought it necessary to hijack a thread by a student asking about the necessity of more than one ""break"" in a while loop to lecture about what constitutes pseudo-code and what does not on a non-assignment question. This didn't contribute to the original posters question.Despite that Dr. Chuck's courses are always a real pleasure!",4
77863,good but too easy...,4
77866,"A very basic course, but not bad.",4
77887,Very personable instructor,4
77891,This is my first course I am taking on Coursera and I am amazed how much I am actually learning. Dr Chuck is really good in the video lessons and really manage to 'come thru the screen'.,4
77892,Gr8 initial course on python,4
77897,Had no pre knowledge for languages. Coursera is preparing me for the cutting edge world.,4
77904,Really good introduction to programming. Suggested for all the beginners in CS.,4
77909,Well organized and simply to understand,4
77920,"The professor explain really good the material. The best thing is to review the book, it helps to understand better the concepts of Programming and capability of Python",4
77926,"It is as stated: Programming for Everybody (who hasnt had any expsoure to programming). If you dont know about computers and you dont know about programming, this course is for you.On the other hand: if you do have a basic understanding of computers and/or programming, than this may no be the right course for you: The beginning is too slow - the stuff about CPUs & memory etc. is really for people who dont know about computers at all. The overall pace is too slow.My suggestion would be toa) shorten the introductiory partb) increase lurning-curve & depthc) add more complex assignments -> maybe as ""bonus assignments""",4
77928,"The course materials such as the lecture videos, slides , assignments and pdf helped me to grasp and implement the basics of Python very well. I have recommended this course to my colleagues who are interested in learning Python",4
77949,great teacher and class; last exercise was tough!,4
77960,"it‘s easy to understand, suitable for ABC.",4
77963,"Dr. Chuck makes the course quite simple. At the beginning of the course, he patiently introduces some preparing steps such as python installation and screenshot tools, which is quite useful for students with little computer knowledge. During the course, Dr. Chuck manages to use the simplest language to explain the concepts. The slides use different colors to differentiate different elements in a script, indicating Dr. Chuck's consideration for the students. The course reminds me of the sentence from The Zen of Python, ""simple is better than complex.""The course is a beginning course for python. I studied Visual Basic in my freshman year, and now, three years after VB, I found the assignments quite easy. So I advise that if you have prior knowledge of other languages, you can use the book provided by Dr. Chuck to quickly understand the concepts and view some example code. Then you can directly jump to the assignments and I suppose that it would not be too hard for you.I heard MOOC one year ago and enrolled several courses at Coursera. However, this is my first finished course. Sometimes the network speed of the school was too slow to view the videos and this really slowed me down. I also had some school work and exams. Now I am at the end of my undergraduate study and have enough time to take MOOCs. $310 is quite expensive for me but I hope I can accomplish the five courses of this specialization and some day I'll come back to pay for the certification.Thanks to Dr. Chuck and mentors.Tao.ZhengHuazhong University of Science&Technology, P.R.China",4
77966,Python console would be better.,4
77974,"I really like almost every part of this course. It goes at a good pace for people who have no programming experience. I previously attempted to take a Python course that did not explain enough of what it wanted, and I almost gave up on learning Python. This course is not like that. The only downside to it is that the professor explains almost too much; the pace is almost too slow. If you have no programming experience but want to try Python, this is definitely the course to start with.",4
77988,Good course on Python.,4
77993,Very good course with great teacher,4
77994,"Solid course for getting started with Python, and programming in general. I thought some concepts were explained a little too much, so the videos could have been shorter. But better to over explain, than summarize and leave people wondering. I'll be continuing the Python courses for sure!",4
77995,Very Very nicely explained...,4
78005,Very easy and easy to understand,4
78007,A lot to say but I think I am not the one to judge,4
78010,Easy to follow and with clear exercises,4
78013,"This course starts off very slow but, picks up the pace near the end. The material presented is clear and easy to understand. I wish it was offered in Python 3 but, the structures are very similar and translate well. I plan on finishing the full specialization and then translating that knowledge into a lesser known language called Julia (which isn't readily offered yet). I definitely recommend this course as a place to start.",4
78016,Very good course for beginners.,4
78025,This course is really good for python beginners.,4
78027,"Very good course, simple and easy to follow.",4
78029,"Great introduction for programming.I think it can be improved with more logic content and assignments, as well as some real cases (such as real examples of text file parsing, etc).",4
78032,"I suggest this course for beginner students, mainly those don't basic kwonledge in computer.",4
78033,"For those absolutely new to programming, this course covers the core foundations of programming and is taught in a very approachable fashion. I was pleased to see there was an introduction into what is occurring ""under the covers"" - solid intro to CPU, Memory, peripherals and how programs/software utilize these resources.",4
78034,really nice and delightful to learn in such an effective manner in this platform!I whole heartedly thank each and everyone behind this global mission.,4
78041,It could go a bit faster.,4
78043,very well thought of course content and delivery ...,4
78069,Can have more rigorous assignments. Right now the code snippets are already provided. Maybe keep some optional tough assignments to cater to all levels of programming abilities :),4
78070,"Good for starters, but should enhance the complication of assignments.",4
78071,Great course for begginers on Python.,4
78073,A great and easy introduction that does not scare away a newcomer. Learn at your own pace and then enroll in the next course!,4
78075,This course helped me understand the basics of Python programming.,4
78080,Basic approach to Python programming.,4
78091,A good course but way too easy since I'd programmed in other languages before... I finished the whole course in an afternoon but was useful to learn some of the important syntax and key words in the python language,4
78105,It is really helpful for those who are willing to learn.,4
78126,This is quite helpful and i really enjoyed the course....,4
78128,Course for beginner to study Python.Thank you professor Severance with exellent lectures!,4
78129,"LOT OF EFFORT HAS BEEN PUT INTO MAKING THIS COURSE, WELL DONE!!!",4
78131,"Very good course,but i think that exams are are very easy.",4
78140,"I knew a little bit about python before taking this course, but consider myself a beginner. The class was a little bit too easy for my liking. But I know this is the beginning of a five part class, which will get progressively in depth. I look forward to the other courses!",4
78142,"A bit of a slow start, but that's probably necessary for a programming course. Good way to get started. Definitely need to take the follow-up courses.",4
78150,"Challenging, detailed, just the right amount of everything you need to start learning Python. However, the lectures were painfully long.",4
78152,"The lectures are very good, and initiate thinking process like a computer executes a program. I would expect more challenging practice problems",4
78160,This is a nice introductory course to programing with good foundations to continue learning.,4
78167,Good intro to Python - very instructive videos especially on the installation and actual implementation/use of the program,4
78169,pretty basic course,4
78170,Good to start learning python from scratch. The Bonus Video are Awesome. I Loved this course.,4
78177,This is really good!,4
78180,"Excellent course, maybe a bit more exercises (or at least links to sources) would make it more useful",4
78201,"I recently completed an Code Yourself! MOOC run by Edinburgh University which used Scratch to code. They recommended trying Python coding as a next step so I signed up for this course. I've found it to be excellent, fun, and challenging. I very much appreciate that Dr Severance makes all his materials freely available to download under the Creative Commons licence.I'm giving it a 4 rather than 5star rating is because I think new Coursera platform needs to be sorted out and improved. I've encountered several glitches in doing this course which are due to the platform not the course material.",4
78206,"Excellent course for beginners, the rythm is perfect! I just wish there were more (ungraded) excercices with solutions to practice more on my own.",4
78224,"Great starter course. Was challenging at times as I started with a book on python 3 and this course covers 2.7, but overall very well done.",4
78229,"very good course, python had very much significance in today's world.Thank You all.",4
78255,"The course was very easy if you got prior knowledge in programming in any other programming language. However this was a pretty good introduction to Python. I'm wondering why you are still teaching Python 2, when most people are already using Python 3 already. I've seen there are major differences between Python 2 and 3, most examples learned here would give Syntax error in Python 3.I think this used to be an older course, recorded several years ago. That's why Python 2 is being used. Python 3 is pretty much mature now.",4
78259,Pretty amazing course,4
78262,Good course. People with a good heart too,4
78268,The lectures are good for the beginners.,4
78273,Coursera's platform + Chuck's teaching style = Great !,4
78279,This was a very nicely organized course,4
78288,"Straight-to-the-point yet fun lectures. Slow and easy pace at the start for appreciation, but gradually becomes more challenging towards the end to force you to learn hands-on coding, In my opinion, the best part is the python coding tool used in the coding assignments.",4
78289,Basic principles for learning python and also fun!.Enjoy it!,4
78292,"Excellent introduction to Python. Instructor teaches with humour and lots of examples, making the lecture videos useful and entertaining. Good pace for an intro course, easy to start with increasing difficulty as it progresses.",4
78294,"I really enjoyed this course, and found it easy to keep up with the projects by setting aside one day a week. I find that the lectures move a little slowly, but simply speeding up the video time made it feel much more efficient. Following along with the e-book, I felt confident going through each of the exercises, and had a lot of fun while banging my head against the keyboard trying to figure out how to make things work (due to my own errors, not problems within the course).I'm looking forward to the next class!",4
78299,Good course for beginners. Lacks sufficient exercises.,4
78305,good stuff. I think that working in an IDE like PyCharm would greatly assist those new to the development community. Very grateful for Coursera,4
78306,"Great course. Although the paste of the course was a bit slow for a person who is already familiar with programming languages other than Python, speeding up the sessions solved everything. The only draw back which prevents this course from reaching five stars is the lack of more challenging problems that could have been put in the course as a bonus for those who are after wrestling with codes a bit more. The rest is good.",4
78313,Great entry-level Python course!,4
78316,I feel this is a great start to a wonderful program that you all have provided . However o wish there was a way to share code to help optimize the many many errors I had made beforehand. Thank you for the opportunity.,4
78327,I think this would be a very good introduction to anyone starting to learn to program in a new language - Having experience in other languages meant that I was able to skip most of the lectures and complete the quizzes/assignment with a python 'cheat sheet'. Hopefully still a useful background for learning more in-depth python features.Lectures were interesting and well-structured.,4
78332,Fairly easy,4
78339,"Nice course! It is definitely a beginner's course, and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course. I really think there should be an option for people who aren't absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and/or do the capstone. After all, this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science, which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners.For what it is, though, namely a very beginning level course to teach the concepts of programming with Python, it's very well executed.",4
78341,"Great course when you are just getting started with Python. Nice buildup in the material. Functions and loops are explained in a visual way, this was a big help to me",4
78343,i was elated to be a part in this coursework. The professor explanation was very clear and intriguing. Thanks to all those who have organised this coursework.,4
78351,great study materials and presentation.,4
78359,Very useful course to begin with python.,4
78361,"The course is very simple. If you have any programming knowledge or have tried python in the past only a little, its a great refresher. If you have no coding experience at all, it is a fantastic introduction!",4
78363,Laudable the Creative Commons approach and the material was quite all right. Keep up the wonderful job!,4
78371,Very Good Beginner Course for Python. Pretty short in material length but if you are looking to start programming I would strongly recommend it. Very good examples and quizes at the end of each section make sure you know your stuff.,4
78381,Great start for anyone who wants to begin with python programming. Course is well designed and love the way it progresses along with the assignments and the small videos in between.,4
78383,Ideal also for those who have no experience with programing.,4
78388,Nice introduction to Python,4
78395,"Needs an update and the slides are hard to see, but overall very good.",4
78413,maybe the pace is a little drawn out.,4
78417,"The course is too easy if you know any programming language, but I think that it is very helpful for newbies in programming.",4
78423,Simple straight forward and engaging. The course material is well crafted. I loved learning python and all lectures were succint in nature.,4
78428,Nicely crafted course for beginners,4
78432,"Great course, easy for whom already know how to program, but really great for the ones who are beginning programming! The next courses should be great too.",4
78438,Really good start to get the basics down in Python. Would recommend to students that want to learn Python. However I would recommend upgrading the class to use Python 3.,4
78439,Well structured and easy to follow. Would be great if it is taught in Python 3.,4
78450,"Very interesting course, linear with a good teacher.i would have liked to do more exercises.",4
78458,"well taught, good pace, am continuing to course 2",4
78460,Nice one. Perfect for complete beginners.,4
78465,Nothing was as satisfying as knowing nothing about computer code in the beginning and getting to a point where I could write some simple code without looking at anything else for help.,4
78467,"good course for beginners, it is the clasical course that covers the first 2-3 chapters of every programming book. It is good in case you want to do the whole specialization in other case is too simple if you are going to pay for it.",4
78469,very helpful for programming in python,4
78472,"So far so good. A bit on the slow side, but this is understandable as it is an intro course. Dr Chuck certainly has the energy and enthusiasm to make an intro programming course very very engaging and fun. Looking forward to the next level up!",4
78482,This course was excellent for the beginner. A little more content for the length would have made it 5 stars.,4
78483,"All lectures are presented very professionally and in form which is easy to understand. Steady progress easy to learn. Unfortunately practical part doesn't allow too much flexibility to play with the code. To do extra work, add some features, be just little more creative. I understand that it was graded by program and needs to have some limits but this can be solved by given hard criteria that needs to be met and peer assessment grading which will wider students horizon by checking others code. To see others ideas. This missing spark for creativity make me to give ""only"" 4 starts. In whole it is great course worth any minute spend.Thank you. Vlad",4
78493,Great Course for Beginners ...,4
78494,"This is a course for beginner. Anyone want program, should take it.",4
78495,The course is really useful for those who learn the basics of programming using python. People who already know programming in different language and would like to python please stand out from this.,4
78504,"Great of individuals looking to introduce themselves to Python or reintroduce themselves. If you have a basic understanding of Python, you might wish to look elsewhere. The course is well taught and enjoyable videos make the learning fun.",4
78509,This is very basic and fundamental.,4
78510,"I love the enthusiasm of the professor and the material he covered. This would be very good for complete beginner to programming, but may make you feel little slow for people migrating from other languages like C/C+ etc.Overall, i enjoyed the course. Thanks",4
78516,"Great course for people who wants to learn how to program. Recommended for everyone. However, i find the final few chapters on loops is harder to grasp and would recommend if there are ways to simply on it. Overall, i had a great experience in completing this. Looking forward to advance further in programming python! Kudos to Mr Charles Severance for the great work! :)",4
78517,Very practical and didactic.,4
78520,A very decent primer for everyone new to programming or dusty on a different language.,4
78525,simply awesome!!,4
78527,Good course to start basic programming in Python,4
78542,"Great introduction course with good organized detail.Although I am an experienced C/C++ programmer,I think this should be still very easy for beginners.",4
78545,it is too simple,4
78554,Useful for Beginners! Maybe a bit slow for people with experience in other programming languages.,4
78557,"While being super intuitive, the course is too easy even for beginners,The lectures are coherent and smooth, assignment could be slightly more difficult.",4
78561,Nice and easy course. I think the slides need some improvement especially for those who just study from them without explanation from the instructor.Thanks,4
78569,Best way to get started with a new programming language !,4
78577,One of the better online courses I have used.,4
78578,"Very good info; just wish the Android app, desktop app, and iOs app all updated more gracefully (maybe a critique of Coursera more generally?)Assignments are pretty easy.",4
78584,Good for most entry-level. For people who already have a basic knowledge of the course will be very easy,4
78588,Too easy!,4
78599,Course content was very simple which helps a new-bee to get acquainted with python in an easy manner. Professor Chuck is also great.,4
78617,"More exercises would be nice! Overall, a very nice course.",4
78618,Basic introduction to Python,4
78626,Pretty good for starters,4
78627,"I thought the class was good, although if you are already an experienced programmer (like me), I suggest that you do a quick review of the python documentation to understand python syntax, then simply complete each assignment rather than sitting through the videos.",4
78629,"This course is a very good place to start learning programming. Although I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I still found the delivery style in the course very interesting. It is a great course for someone who is trying to learn how to program. Python, as a language itself is very intuitive and this course helps a new learner understand the basics of programming as well as learn the language easily.",4
78657,You have to be extremely unfamiliar with programming to stay interested at the beginning.,4
78672,This course has fun lectures and very interesting bonus content.,4
78673,"Excellent overview of first few concepts in Programming in Python. Useful in understanding programming concepts (early early stages) for those who have never done programming and refresher for those who have, but it has been a while, I look forward to seeing how the other courses in the this series are. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because I think in addition to the given assignments there should be an extra assignment per week with practical applications. Granted not enough of the language is know yet to warrant anything really complex, but perhaps just number converter for scientific notation, or a tip calculator with code given that can make it practical to use (connect it to a website or phone application).",4
78679,"Easy, so it's for everybody, you name it!But a little bit too easy, let's leap a head!",4
78684,Very good starting point for python!,4
78692,"Quick and simple, very easy if you have some knowledge of what you are doing. Good if you are getting started.",4
78701,"The course was very basic. It was nicely taught and the examples and the lectures were really enjoyable. However, some shortcomings I felt were that the colors in the slides could have been a bit clearer. Another thing was that some concepts were introduced in the lectures which were not explained completely. A real beginner would not be able to understand them which would in some parts defeat the purpose of the course.Other than that, I felt the course was really structured well. The assignments were easy and the quizzes did test the knowledge about the subject taught so far. It was such that any new person would not feel discouraged.Keep up the good job people.",4
78706,Good introduction level course!,4
78711,"Great course delivery and loved the extra videos, however as an experienced java developer I found the course too basic.",4
78715,"The quality of the content is excellent and is presented clearly (although the lecturer drinking various things throughout the lectures was odd...). I plowed through all seven weeks in a day because I had already finished the first three weeks of the Rice University Python course (also on Coursera); I would say this entire course is nearly equivalent to the first three weeks of the Rice course. My reasons for doing this are two-fold: (1) practice, practice, practice, and (2) I plan to take all four courses in this series from U Mich - I am interested in the web and database aspects that do not seem to be covered in the Rice course. I did learn a thing or two from each course that was not presented in the other, but those points were relatively minor and would probably be stumbled across on a future troubleshooting visit to stackoverflow.",4
78747,Course can have more content and little complex assignments.,4
78750,"The course was overall simple and easy to learn the basics of python. Even you don't have any background experience in programming, you can learn A-Z with this course.",4
78751,"A little bit too fundamental...Professor is kind and funny, which is good!",4
78754,Useful information for anyone who talks or writes.,4
78755,"The course is great, but i think it should include more problems or quizzes to apply what is learned in the lectures.",4
78757,Its a tough course but worth it!More in depth details will be much better.Coding Assignments can be explained much better. In this course there is problem in understanding coding assignment details as in some cases they are not explained correctly.,4
78764,"I found the topics well chosen, providing an good overview of techniques used for NLP. The introduction to NLP was a bit long, assuming that people who take this course know what NLP is about and why it is difficult for computers. However my main critics is the lengthy programming exercises that were badly described. I spend a significant amount of time just to try to figure out what to do. It required reading of papers and chapters of books to understand the algorithms. I missed the formulas and methods in the lecture notes. A little bit more technical details in selected topics (that are used today) and less of a broad overview of historical approaches would earn 5 stars from me.",4
78766,The course skims through loads of topics .Need to go deep in some of them.,4
78774,"I really like the course, would recommend to have more assignments.",4
78775,"Very challenging course, but I enjoy it",4
78776,Very good introductory course on natural language processing.,4
78778,Nice introductory course.,4
78780,Very helpful.,4
78781,too much of introduction. can easily cut down of that. when you first listen to it - there is no way to remember all the details,4
78792,"Liked it a lot: pretty straight forward, nice introduction, although I missed a bit of a timeline (or figure of a timeline - I actually had this image from wikipedia always available:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy#/media/File:Presocratic_graph.svg)",4
78799,"The course was good and informative. I did find it somewhat simple and not very challenging (until the final project), but with going to work and with a busy schedule it was perfect and left little excuse for not completing it. Thank you for providing a free opportunity to learn.",4
78807,"Very interesting and challenging. I need to spend a lot of time on the reading assignment, but I enjoyed the reading very much.",4
78815,"Dr. Meyer is a systematic and thorough presenter, and does an excellent job of making the material accessible, without oversimplifying.",4
78817,...excellent course for beginners but also for advanced - you will get always a new point of view.,4
78819,"very knowledgeable professor. only recommendation for the course is to make single quizzes not two per week. either way you can do them at your own pace. It is an introduction course, but very well presented and it goes through many important texts",4
78825,Interesting material well presented.,4
78828,"A good introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy, though not as in depth as it could be",4
78829,everything is fine but the music before each lecture is so loud and annoying,4
78838,"Intuitive, clear and logical progression through important ideas in early Western thought, surprisingly fresh and relevant today.",4
78850,"I enjoyed every aspect of this course except Timaeus. Not being mathematically inclined I felt all of the discussion of triangles and what this was supposed to have shown was a waste of time. Better to tell us what he is trying to say, show a few examples, and move on.",4
78863,Very interesting and well structure course.,4
78866,Clear and insightful explanation.,4
78869,"Before this course the topic of philosophy had never appealed to me, while from now on it turns out to be an interesting subject. A wonderful introduction to ancient philosophy of Greece !",4
78879,Thorough course with a decent starters' course for people who are new to R.,4
78880,I think the exercises could be more deep.,4
78883,Nice intro to stats and R.,4
78886,"It takes many more hours to complete the work than the estimates provided. For example the final project took me about nine hours, versus the 2.5 hours listed.Still, a well-rounded course and it has already proven useful.",4
78887,"The stats info and exercises were helpful for learning stats/probability. The labs were somewhat helpful, but did NOT prepare you for the project at the end of the course. Prerequisites say not necessary to know R coding, but I REALLY struggled getting through the assignment in a timely manner and eventually wasn't happy with what I had to submit to make the deadline. I highly recommend taking a few courses in R in DataCamp or watching videos about R Studio (dplyr and tidyr) before attempting the labs and project.",4
78889,"Overall, I would recommend this class. I found that the preparation towards the final project could use some improvement, especially plotting using the 'ggplot2' package. Why not work on this during Week 4 through an assignment that works on this? This would have made it easier to focus on the research questions of the project and less on the graph making mechanics. Also, I found that the project was a little bit too open-ended and could have used some more input from the instructors' side. The material during the four weeks of the course was really good and thorough but perhaps a little too difficult to follow for people who have absolutely no background in probability theory. Maybe one should audit the course first and then decide whether it would be a good idea to formally enroll.",4
78892,"We used DPLYR package without any requisite introduction, but it was nonetheless very informative, thanks!",4
78897,I enjoyed watching the course videos. Really nice practice material to get you going!!! Koodos!,4
78912,"Good professor, good exercises to review what you've learned.My only complaint - if considered that - is that R was difficult for me to learn and work with, especially when I'll be using SPSS for my own statistical needs moving forward. I'd like for there to be an option within the course to use SPSS instead of R.",4
78916,"The course was greatHowever, I expect to have some kind of more exercise since the amount of workload is not enoughThanks for building this coursePHAN Truong Quoc",4
78920,To easy to sink tons of time into the final coursework.,4
78921,A smooth introduction to statistics. Interesting and well organized.,4
78929,"Does a good job of covering the basics. In my case, I'm looking for more of a refresher rather than learning the concepts for the first time.",4
78933,"Presentation of the content, course slides and labs are best from what I've seen on Coursera. The only downside was that to my feeling the final project and the course content are somehow disconnected. The course itself deals with introduction to probability, while final project is EDA. I don't think there was enough materials on EDA in the course, so the final project took more effort and was confusing at first.",4
78937,A brief discussion to the questions asked in between the video lecture might be useful for those who got it wrong.,4
78945,It's very worth to learn but really difficult.,4
78961,"Great videos and testing structure. Great feedback to all of my questions in the forums too. 7 hours a week seems about right for me, with the recommended reading and watching the videos. However the course got continually harder and harder and by the time I was at the final exam I was really worried. In the end it got a bit difficult and stressful but I do feel it was valuable, and like I said, getting the feedback, even on weekends in the forums, helped a lot.",4
78983,"The course videos are good, but the R programming is not well explained. I've enrolled in other Coursera courses that use R, Python or Octave, and they all provide clear demo videos for beginners to get up to standard with the code. This course doesn't do that so it's not a good intro to R, which is a shame because working in statistics these days is all about using R and similar tools so there should be a stronger emphasis on that.",4
78988,"Solid and efficient introduction to content, does not do enough teaching in R for the final project - which is *fine* because finding things out for yourself is the best way to learn, but R help online is often so dense that it's not that helpful to a beginner. More responsive mentors - especially nearer the end of the course - would be really helpful.",4
78989,It was a well taught course,4
78991,Great course to help you get started in statistics.,4
78992,Fantastic course. Both the lessons and materials were very educational. Besides it constitutes a very didactic introduction to ggplot2 and dplyr.,4
78993,great course so far!!,4
79004,"If you have prior knowledge of R, then this course will help to brush up your statistics. The pacing of the material is very good. The examples used are relevant and interesting. Great course in general.",4
79013,"Great introductory course in statistics. The lectures are not about R per se, but you learn R by applying the statistics that you have learned.",4
79014,"Lectures and material we're really good. Haven't done the practical part, so can't say anything about it.",4
79016,"While the final project was a little unclear in terms of its parameters and there were several small file problems, this was overall a very well constructed course, especially in terms of its content before the final project.",4
79020,"should be open to anyone. But is ok, you can still ger knowledge without paying",4
79024,"The content of this course is not terribly difficult, I thought, but it's a very good introduction into most aspects of Data Science. You learn to familiarize yourself with R quite well and get a lot of independence to create a final project based on a huge data set. One thing I would've liked is a sample completed project, start to finish, to see what was expected- the things that got produced (which you peer review) varied hugely in quality.",4
79040,I am hoping for some more R specific programming and reference.,4
79044,"The content is very well structured, the explanations are clear and full of useful examples. Some concepts were a bit difficult to grasp and required reviewing outside the material of the course. In general, excellent.",4
79061,Great lectures. The course project could benefit from greater structure.,4
79078,"Well done! Information is perfectly structured and explained. However, this course might be interesting mostly for russian-speaking people. 4 out of 5.",4
79082,Very interesting and helpful course. Well organized. The first lecture is better.,4
79084,A good intro course on Marxism. You MUST know Chinese to understand this course (and interact with classmates).,4
79087,The material is good and the professor is clear and knowledgable. Hopefully there would be more reference documents recommended.,4
79089,"Very interesting, as long as you do not undertake the course to become popular ! I learned a lot, but at the end of the course, I felt that the course was too much oriented on the problems that can arise for young people, especially if they are not popular. Good course anyway",4
79090,It's really good,4
79096,"Good and insightful. Felt there were some assumptions being made that should be questioned, but, overall, it was a very enjoyable class with an enjoyable teacher. Gave me some information I'm passing onto my daughter on her journey through middleschool also.",4
79099,Useful information,4
79100,The course is great. I learned a lot about popularity and the affects on adults. It would be even better if their were some whitepapers or books added to the course.,4
79107,"Interessting Course. Many ""Nice to know"" moments and very well produced",4
79109,"Although I really liked this course (not having paid for it, just watching the videos and the discussions), I think you guys make way too much emphasis on child psychology. Not that this is a bad thing, I actually loved the way you approached the problem of how popularity and its conceptions changes over age, I think you could add some other examples of popularity in adulthood. I would love to see how this conception of popularity affects the workplace, peer relations and romantic relationships further in adulthood.Thanks, a lot.",4
79113,"Pretty awesome course, everything is crystal clear, it's fun and simple, but it doesn't involve any additional coursework besides exams, so there's not much extra learning from peers.",4
79116,"Was expecting a course geared towards how popularity affects adults in day to day life and how to improve one's own popularity. This course expands upon the various studies done with respect to children and adolescents. It also provides a few examples of how popularity in early life extends to adult life. Still a very useful course if you have children or wondered what it took to be popular as a child, but due to the difference in expectations, I'm giving this course a 4/5 instead of a 5/5.",4
79139,"it will be better if there is some form of text or readings that can be shared in the course.When speaking of the examples during the lecture, I wish there is a real video of the experience rather than just the prof speaking of it. I wish I could have my own understanding in responding to those experiences. However, overall I learnt a lot through out the courses, it is really easy to understand, and usually I watch the videos when I want to take a break from whatever I was doing.",4
79147,"Educational, interesting, although a bit simple. Recommended.",4
79153,Good training. Very useful!,4
79158,"Very useful course and tools that help in real life but I think it needs more examples and in depth explanation for the toolsOverall , I enjoyed it and very helpful",4
79167,Mint,4
79172,Good course for working professionals especially Engineers.,4
79176,Excellent course teaches how to deal in pressure situation.,4
79186,Good introduction to problem solving.,4
79195,"The course is very interesting and challenging. Prof. Stone is detail-oriented and open-minded. The only thing that can be even better is the course content. For example: we learned about decision making styles. We mentioned majority, minority, expect, authority with input, etc. But prof. Stone didn't mention which of these is the most effective one. I think the course content can go into more details and more explanations. Overall, I really enjoyed studying with prof. Stone.",4
79197,"Usefull but simple, would recommend to include a more in-depth content in future updates",4
79198,Very good course. You can get a common sensen how to make,4
79204,Very lovely and knowledge impacting course,4
79207,"Very good course, interesting.",4
79210,Nice course ... easy to understand and complex concepts are well-simplified,4
79216,Good introductory course,4
79220,This course has introduced me to different and useful methods of solving problems that I am excited to try applying on different issues. Thank you for providing it.,4
79226,The course is a very straight forward overview of problem solving and decision making principles. A good introduction to using various supporting decision tools. Short and effective module.,4
79228,This course gives you better insights in Problem-solving and the tools to measure this.,4
79229,"This course contains interesting points about group decision methods and change management. I think it could be deeper, but I liked it overall.",4
79230,Good learning and presentation,4
79231,"good, but too simple and basic",4
79235,Good course but it is missing detailed explanations for some topics.,4
79236,"Explores the basics concepts of problem-solving, and they can appear easy and logical; but when you try to apply them, you can notice that it's not so basic and you can really nurture with this course.",4
79239,interested course,4
79242,Mr. Stone explained charts in such a clear and relaxed way that my fear of statistics has disappeared! I was also able to apply the course information to manage my daily tasks more effectively. Thank you!,4
79243,"A very good course, i liked very much the examples used, i do wish there where some practical exercises.",4
79244,"Useful information, techniques.Easily understood and applied in practical cases",4
79245,"Mainly focus on tools, if adding more strategy or thinking model related will be better.",4
79249,"EnjoyaOverall, very useful introduction.",4
79250,It is a good course but not everything was as clear as in other courses. Anyway it provides a lot of very useful information.,4
79252,A disconnect between Video Lecture - Transcript (horrid form !) - Slides - Test questions. Information flow should be more fluent.,4
79253,Inroduced useful tools to deal with decision making,4
79254,Good course,4
79260,Nice introduction to problem solving and decision making.,4
79264,It was an interesting course.,4
79268,Good but very theoretical,4
79270,This is an excellent course. It covers how data helps in taking decisions. It also talks about group decision making and gives the pros and cons of each of the methods and finally it explains how to manage change in an organization. All in all a great course.,4
79271,Totally beneficial!,4
79273,This was a very good course. The practical examples were useful.,4
79276,"It's a great course with important and nicely presented information. It could be even better if University Of California, Irvine would make it more informative and longer than it is right now.",4
79277,"The course s outstanding; well designed and well presented but it should be with statement of accomplishments. Because in third world countries, the concept of online open courses will take time to gain acceptance. So in order to prove the ""Worth"" of these course, they demand documentary proof. 49$ is big amount ( 1$ =104 PKR) in 3rd world countries, so its not possible to pay for one course.",4
79283,"From the title It could look like it's something very basic and that's common knowledge, but it gives a good foundation to what we normally do in a regular basis and it also shows different ways of thinking and approaching problems and solutions.",4
79285,Great course! It has very good material,4
79292,Thanks for practical knowledge from this course,4
79293,very practical and useful!clear pronunciation.,4
79295,Thank you for this course..the examples were excellent. But I couldn't go back to the course once I had seen the video.,4
79301,Easy to learn ^^The professor explain by giving easy understanding examples. Not take time too much,4
79317,Great first part with clear and vivid explanations. Later in the course a little too many referrals to the book.,4
79321,this course is one of the most useful and helpful course among all of my courses.I Send you My Special Regards to you Dear Prof And Also your Nice Team.,4
79324,"This course is nice, effective and works like a deep glance for those who are having background knowledge of this subject.It's also good for freshers, but they need to keep on reading books along with these lectures.",4
79332,I think it was very informative,4
79333,"Awesome course, really opens my mind!",4
79335,"Introduction to Personal Branding is a good course. Professor Barker is full of energy and she is also quite funny. She introduced us to a very large topic in a short amount of time and based on her agenda, succeeded. Taking Introduction to Personal Branding prepared me for my current course, Career Brand Management, where a lot of the terminology is mentioned repeatedly. While it isn't as thorough as my courses, I felt good about entering the course knowing I was introduced to a lot of familiar material in Dr. Barkers course. Thank you.",4
79339,It's valuable course in terms of realizing what's needed to make or maintain your personal brand.,4
79340,"Great course, lot's of eye opening ideas on how to brand yourself and create your digital footprint on the Internet.",4
79341,It's beneficial to take this course. Fantastic refresher.,4
79345,"A very helpful course, with insights I never thought of.",4
79347,Excellent course covering the basics of Personal Branding. It was very interesting and it helped me cement my focus and write my mission statement. The staff and other students were very supportive and engaged.,4
79353,"Basic but wonderful instruction for creating what others think of when they think of you, and what you think of when you think about who you are.",4
79355,"This course is really wonderful. It helps us to know ourselves better and then reflect it in our digital media in order to 'sell' our personality. Nothing is perfect, this course too. In my opinion, the course is not up-to-date and uncompletely describes social media's functionalities.",4
79359,Useful for starting to create personal branding from scratch and have a general idea for how to maintain the brand.,4
79361,Many of the topics covered appeared to be known areas except for an extension of few concepts. The assessments were either simple or not too relevant in accordance with study material.,4
79375,Thank you. This was a great short form course. Quickly got to what I needed.,4
79377,"Great and interesting course.Also very alternative theme, liked it so much.",4
79381,"This course was a fairly decent introduction to personal branding. It certainly made me aware of it, although, it did not completely prepare me for the enormous task of consistent branding. It was a good place to start if you know nothing about things like twitter which I didn't.",4
79386,3 stars for the content and the fourth stars because the way the instructor presented it was amusing.,4
79387,Enjoyed the course Kimberley. You made it fun and informative and I used the content to make a slew of changes! I had a real distilling of exactly where I am going with my brand and I'm off on this adventure of creating it now. Can I convince you to do a course ORM through Coursera?,4
79389,This is an interesting course. I love the quirkiness of the professor and that she comes across as genuine and happy with her unique self. I am enjoying this course and I think that it will add to my personal and career development.,4
79394,"Excellent, highly valuable, life changing, presented in an enjoyable, fresh way! :)",4
79404,This course was everything I thought it'd be. It was a simple and fast course to learn about personal branding and what you stand for as a leader.,4
79411,Interesting overview of personal branding and social medias.,4
79413,"Kimberley is a wonderful instructor keeping the student engaged with her wonderful personality and wit. The information is well suited to someone with very limited experience in personal branding and social media. Having said that, the information is clear and concise and worth the time for someone with more experience just to make sure they haven't missed a little gem of knowledge.",4
79415,Great general overview for those with little to no familiarity with personal branding. I love the instructor's wit and humor.,4
79418,friendly and joyful course,4
79423,"This course really gets you thinking about what you post on the internet and how and where you're posting that information. Right off the hop this course wasn't what I was expecting - little did I know the difference between personal branding and personal marketing but, now I know! I wish that there wasn't so much emphasis on Twitter as there are tons of other great social media venues that all have there perks depending on what you're goals are. I liked that this course was a lot about learning",4
79425,Useful course! Thank you!,4
79431,"As suggested by other learners, this course is a good introduction for the majority of us out there. It gives you the essential skills you need, as well as provides resources to dig deeper. Extra bonus, the instructor is very engaging and funny, and the format is informal in a good way.",4
79435,Very good course but some of the videos were buffering and I couldn't view them properly.,4
79437,Very useful,4
79438,Very nice starting point for personal branding. Encourages self-reflection and awareness via a few exercises. Touches upon social media presence and use.Very helpfull in building your personal brand.,4
79442,"A very simple and easy to understand course. Very impactful if you take it seriously and try doing what the instructor explains. The articles that were shared were very useful, especially while creating a mission statement, etc. Would recommend to those who want to be launch their new self.",4
79446,Great class for students with no knowledge on branding.,4
79448,"Some very valuable learnings from this relatively easier course. I'll be taking my personal brand way more seriously now and with some concrete ideas I got from this course.Could have been 5 star if there was a bit more depth to the course. The 1-on-1 on twitter was not really needed. If someone can find out about coursera, then not knowing how to use twitter was far fetched possibility.",4
79449,Great communicator! Just it needs more content. I already knew most of the things! However I have enjoyed. Congrats!,4
79451,In this course I found a lot of useful tips and ideas.Thanks!,4
79453,Great instructor! Very good content and reference readings. I only wish the course wouldn't be so introductory.,4
79455,"Great instructor, some really helpful learning here!",4
79461,I liked the professor a lot but I wish the class went into a bit more detail about marketing your brand and how to manage your reputation in the event of negative reviews,4
79464,"As a software engineer, materials related to social medias and its privacy issues are not new at all. However, basic principals and practices on the personal branding are very helpful. I am still searching for my board of directors. This course makes me change how I live as a professional.",4
79472,the teacher is very courage and beautiful,4
79476,good and nice to experience,4
79481,"Very nice course, very well paced with simple examples and ideas that all persons can achieve.",4
79488,"Loved the course but thought it wasn't enough. I wanted to cover more topics, more material and more videos from our charismatic teacher Kimberley",4
79493,Very clear explanation.A simple approach that helps to understand most of the concepts reviewed.Thanks.,4
79494,"Great course in general!Unfortunately some lectures are missing and on Quiz's some questions missing description and some pictures missing too and authors don't reply on remarks yet.Will be glad to rate ""5 stars"" when remarks are fixed.",4
79497,"Wrong subtitles, no communication...",4
79500,A good broad range of topics covered.,4
79501,great course,4
79504,"MUY BUENA HERRAMIENTA, ME PARECE ESENCIAL, MUY CLARA PARA SER ENTENDIDA POR CUALQUIER PERSONA",4
79517,very clear and ussefull... thanks!!,4
79558,It would have been so much better if the content of week 4 were given to us at the very beginning. Other than that i am happy with the course :),4
79580,"Very informative and engaging. Stephen's attitude makes you want to go and make recordings right away, it's a pity you can't take quizzes without paying though.",4
79608,Nice intro to production.,4
79610,Very informative. Helped in understanding various minor aspects,4
79624,"This is a great introductory level course to give an overview of the basics of music production. It's a little more focused on songwriting than I had expected, but there is a good amount of technical information as well. You won't come out of this course as the next Steve Albini, but you'll definitely have a great starting point to build from.",4
79626,Very interesting to begin with.,4
79627,Definitely stretched me to think of myself as an artist rather than just a musician. This course is a great starting point for someone who wants to get into the nitty gritty of the creative process!,4
79630,"Excellent for all, beginner or pro, one should try this course. Always thought I knew more than the basics but this course changed my mind. The ABCs of concept and foundation of music which this course offers is something that most people haven not thought about. Totally changed the way I took music as till now.",4
79631,This course gives great insight on how to approach song writing and music production!,4
79642,"very interesting, good lectures,",4
79643,"Very interesting, high scientific content, topics are progressives and lead to a good comprehension of the physical phenomenon on going.Exercices are a good complement to the main lecture.Experiment captured in video were a very good surprise.",4
79659,"It's a great course, It has learning curve hard at the beginning but I improved my english skills integrally.",4
79664,It is helpful for fresh student and student who study in other languages than their own native mother language. Prepare you to be familiar with lecture and provid you clues to deal with incomprehensible situations.,4
79668,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone at all in the professional world. It is thought-provoking, varied, insightful and full of real-life examples. There was a decent amount of content to get through each week but this was broken up into manageable chunks. Interviews with a range of mature professionals were utilised, offering a range of perspectives and professional experiences. The use of peer group assessment was also very positive - firstly it meant that you actually had to complete the assignments set, unlike other courses on coursera, and it also gave you a sense of being part of a learning community, as well as gaining perspectives from other participants on the course.",4
79671,"I think the Course has great content but there´s too many activities per week, most of the time if you don´t have time free you will loss the deadlines and after all loss the certificate.",4
79673,"Without question the content is great, but the written assignment instructions were somewhat vague and did not match the peer review rubric at times (although the mentor did pin a few posts to address the problem).",4
79675,very good course,4
79676,"its a very good course and latest innovative too,where youth could get in interest with",4
79681,Interesting course but sometimes it is difficult to understand what the professor is saying,4
79684,Highly recommended for nanotechnology enthusiasts,4
79685,I find it very difficult to understand what the professor is saying.,4
79686,It is very useful course towards basic nanosensors and technology,4
79689,"Nice course, especially the group-work an creative part is fun.The videos could be better, sometimes it is hard to follow",4
79693,"I loved this course, which is giving me a good background for my work field.",4
79695,This is by far the best course I've seen on cities. It's amazing. But having to translate all the assignment questions is annoying. Surely all the assignment questions could be translated very easily. Having it in English would make this so much more accessible to African students who aren't francophone. I am South African and want to share this with friends but they find the french too intimidating.,4
79700,Really good beginners course as it actively gets you building apps whilst trying to teach you key concepts of programming in Objective C,4
79710,Learned so much in this course. Looking forward to moving on to the next courses!,4
79714,A very good and in-depth knowledge providing course,4
79718,"Nice. I like the style of this course.Strengths:Peer assignment has a comfortable difficulty.Weak points:1 when reviewing, I have to [1]download the video(about 30M) [2] review that assignment; and then [1]->[2]->[1]->[2]. If I can download all the videos which belong to the assignments that I'm going to review, and then I review all of them, that can be a time saver.Peer assignment some times doesn't work so perfect: in week 4, which has some knowledge such as Struct, does not used in that assignment, leave them there without practice.",4
79719,"Such a great, and easy going course",4
79730,"Nice course, nice flow, easy to understand and learn. I recommended it for all my friends. I dropped a star because I Just found it little boring at the end, videos are a bit long with little information.",4
79731,"Very well explanation. However, a lot of Objective-c features are not covered.",4
79737,It should definitely have more quizzes! At least one per week!,4
79738,Have no Chinese sub，most API can't use. Homework is not suit for teaching.,4
79741,"Presentation is clean and good. Exercises are totally guided, and don't actually cover the whole scope of the course.",4
79749,"The course covers very detailed introduction of the iOS development and Object-C language. However, in the demo, sometimes the instructor didn't mention why we are doing that, or using a verbose way to solve the problem (e.g., not using for loop).",4
79751,"I enjoyed the course, despite not having money for the certificate I was very happy with the result.I want to congratulate the teachers taught by great content.",4
79757,"Needs further explanations, good if you already have a programming foundation",4
79767,"It was a fairly good start to learning about Objective-C. A little bit heavy on the theory with not much to break it up at times (maybe a quiz here and there mid video). Also the assignments are not tied in with the theory lectures all that tightly in my opinion. It's almost like doing 2 separate courses at times. Overall, interesting stuff and I am enjoying it. Thanks a million for your efforts, I appreciate the opportunity for some new knowledge.",4
79770,"There is no initial syntax explanation, most exercises are done by copy and paste. That's good for experienced developers but difficult for beginners.",4
79775,This course is very good and fantastic way to start the Objective-C.,4
79779,Very useful,4
79784,"Overall is was a nice course, but could be a bit more clear. In the last 2 assignments, something different was shown in the assignment video than what was written on the assignment paper.",4
79788,"well, I'm really appreciate this course but some points of knowledge are just too simple... Maybe it's because I'm totally lack of foundation :P",4
79812,"It is a great course, they should just expand more and do more questions, the TMBOK guide goes why deeper, they should also but nether the less it is a great course",4
79820,Questions should be a bit more difficult.,4
79824,"Solid information, decent presentation",4
79827,I really enjoyed this course. It boosted my insight into managing projects and solving conflicts,4
79829,Very informative and helpful to learn the foundation of the PMBOK knowledge areas.,4
79834,Great!,4
79835,Great and informative!,4
79837,The course can be improved by giving some more case studies.,4
79845,For Project initial planning & understanding it is very helpful. The course has the scope of all aspects with key knowledge.,4
79847,Great! i learn how to manage the pmbook,4
79848,It has been great to participate in this course. I am sure it will help me to deal with situations/challenges in my job.,4
79852,"Nice basic course of project management, with basic to medium level information. Good introduction to the subject if you follow the whole specialization.",4
79856,Great course. Teaches you a lot of new things related to Project management. Only issue I faced was the flow and how it fits together. A quick summary of all week courses in the end goes extra mile.,4
79857,Good materials,4
79860,It was really great course.,4
79861,this course is helpful.i am a construction management student.,4
79863,Very good course for beginners. First step towards understanding project management . Excellent presentation and content!,4
79879,"The Course is good for a beginner as it is easy to understand. The final test should be a little difficult. If possible the videos could be more elaborate.Instead of slides, Videos could be added to make it more interactive to learn",4
79886,Excellent! Clear and concise,4
79892,"Nice course, perhaps a little light, but it's just an introductory course.Thanks!",4
79898,wonderful time i had it in this course new things i had learned,4
79899,"I think out of all the options for learning about project management and eventually to pass the PMI, this ranks near the top. There is certainly room for improvement, but overall a reasonable approach.",4
79904,This course is very helpful. Makes me think of the possible constraints and how to resolve.,4
79915,"Great introductory course. Well written, well organized, and well presented.",4
79921,"good overview of concepts, nice instructional design",4
79928,Nice introductory course. Very clear ans structured!,4
79935,"Good first steps in project management,",4
79936,Good basic introduction to Project Management. I wish they gave more examples of how it comes together with forms etc.,4
79942,This course is reaaly helpful. thank you,4
79946,Not so interactive.,4
79947,Great course and very comprehensive . It comes with additional videos to help you understand better.,4
79949,Great course to get you started in understanding and learning about project management.,4
79950,A good intro to project management. It was easy to follow and understand.,4
79963,"nice course, I would have loved more video, they were engaging and useful. Also, the course needs more exercises and quizzes are far too easy. A good recap on the subject, helped me, could have been better",4
79964,"A good intro to project management, does not dig deep on concepts, focuses more on familiarizing.",4
79970,Helpful and good introduction to get start on projects management.,4
79971,course was clear and interesting,4
79974,Good course for understanding the basics of project management! Good teacher and good materials.,4
79975,"Overall, the course was good. It offered recorded sessions, examples, case studies, control questions during lessons, and a summary of key principles as extracted from the PMBOK guide. However, it could benefit from having more of the former four items, which should satisfy the need for explanations and application of knowledge. The final exam had some questions repeating from previous quizzes, which can also be avoided.",4
79985,"its have a lot of very useful information including the bonus videos, but the way we are examined could be more challenging and the discussion forum would have been very interesting",4
79986,A very good course . Trustworthy,4
79989,"lack of organization, most of the course is readings, lack of case studies, acceptable in general, one of the rare courses in project management anyway",4
79991,It is reallly good course.,4
79996,Excellent introduction to Project Management. This course give definition to the field and provides foundational context for any level of practice. I especially appreciate the clean visual presentations and valuable bonuses provided by UCIrvine.,4
79997,I really got hooked throughout this course. I loved the idea of expert panelist at the end of course. I have much confidence to apply this knowledge in the real world. Looking forward to other courses!,4
80001,"Interactive lecture, with good breakdown to the core of the knowledge area, but also with a look on the big picture.",4
80002,"Good introduction to project management basics. Deals with the definition of a project and introduces the student to a set of formal ways to document things to consider when starting a project, e.g. scope, stakeholders and responsibility assignments. It is on times a little bit too theoretical for my taste. There are some small case study videos that are well done. Could be a little bit more hands-on.I still enjoyed it, learned a lot and will continue with the second course in this series.",4
80003,Refurbish your project management knowledge.,4
80010,"I liked how the course focused on key concepts only, and kept out unnecessary information. The quizzes could have been more difficult.",4
80011,Very Good course to understand the basic concepts of Project Initiation & Planning.,4
80012,"Modern style, well organised material.",4
80025,Great Course...Advise it for new people in project management world. Exercises could be better (putting scenarios or simulators...etc),4
80042,Good overview and insights,4
80043,The course is very good but they should not promote that much the PMBOK. It is extremely annoying.,4
80044,Great class. Very practical knowledge. I wish I would have taken this class earlier in my career.,4
80046,Easy to understand and simple to keep track!,4
80047,I thought this course was excellently administered and was much better than than many of the online courses I took as an undergrad. I'm excited to start on the next course.,4
80048,"Well-structured lessons, comprehensively covers planning & initiation stages of project management. The quizzes felt a little easy at times!",4
80051,"The course is well prepared, thought through, coherent and structured in a way that it supports the content.However, it felt very much like being in an advertisement program for PMBOK. This feeling was supported by the unavailability of all course materials.Throughout the course the PMBOK guide was included as the suggested reading. The PMBOK materials were featured in each and every lecture and the guidebook was extensively presented and recommended in an extra video. This gives the impression that the course content cannot be sufficiently understood without this literature. Therefore, I would expect the specific recommend chapters to be made available for the participants of the course, especially since this is a paid course.",4
80052,Very interesting and well organized. Sometime it's pretendet to have the pmbok that should not be essential for the book. In geleral there is a week connection between lectures and classes.,4
80053,"Thank interestny course, get for yourself a new required information, a mild form of lessons .Moya difficulty only in translation. Thank you.",4
80066,"Clear and engaging introduction, well spaced out to let the good stuff soak in.",4
80069,"great course ,easy to follow",4
80070,Seemed a bit basic.,4
80076,The course is a little bit hard to follow for the people who are just starting in the Project Management Area. It would be nice to have more video lessons and less additional material to consult.I liked the weekly exercises.,4
80079,"Useful and interesting, but seemed a bit easy; I completed the whole course in only a few hours worth of work.",4
80083,"This was a great course, and I espesially liked the last bonus video. The creaters have grosely underestimateed how much time you are going to use on week 4 though (about scoping). For those of us who does these courses in our work time, that makes it really hard to plan the day.",4
80098,Great course! Great instruction with ability to apply real life situations with examples.,4
80107,Great!,4
80115,"Naturally, I found this section more difficult than the previous courses. I still suggested this to other coworkers, subordinates and supervisors.",4
80121,"I like this coruse and I hope to allow downloading the lessons ""PDF"" for the students to get more benefits and to save these lessons as References",4
80123,the course was nice and clear in all ways through to the end and the videos really give you a clearer picture of what is to be covered.I was so grateful.,4
80125,A very brief and compact course. I would really like it more if even the tools and techniques are introduced in between inputs and outputs. otherwise course was very useful for beginners like me.Thank you,4
80126,"Course content is well-structured and good references are given.What can be improved is that I want to see how these skills can be applied in real life situations. It'd be great if discussion session can be organized by Coursera, basically coordinate students to form discussion groups and meet at least once a week to discuss the topics covered that week.",4
80128,Very interesting approach to the Project Manager world. Even if you have already some experience this course allows you to have a different view.,4
80130,An essential help for those who are determined to gain enough insight on project management.,4
80135,excellent examples and very good videos.,4
80145,The syllabus is carefully structured. Well defined topics and the content is very well written and easy to understand. As a beginner I had absolutely no problem whatsoever in completing the course.,4
80146,"A lot of information, the explanation is clear and intriguing, wish the course could provide more detailed cases and examples so beginners would find them easier to visualise.",4
80151,"Awesome course, very well structured and i am loving it. Thanks",4
80152,"Concise, pertinent information, delivered in short videos. Very didactic.",4
80153,A great way to introduce the students to the initiation of a project,4
80156,Great course and material! It kept me disciplined and following up on class requirements to ensure learning.,4
80158,Presenter was easy to listen to and having the additional exercises helped understand the material.,4
80162,Learning was relevant to any project and put forward in a concise manner. The teachers used real life project management experiences to emphasize concepts and principles. I especially enjoyed the panel discussion with experienced project managers where they talked about their experiences.,4
80164,"I liked everything about this course except that some of the lesson materials couldn't be viewed on my iPad as they were flash based. Other than that, the videos were good - not too long, not too short - and the quizzes were suitably based on what was discussed beforehand in the lectures and lessons. I also picked up one of the recommended readings ""Fast Forward MBA in Project Management"" which I also liked.",4
80167,Loads of information and the pace was great for fitting into my busy schedule.,4
80179,It is a very good course because introduce in a simple way to the main concepts used in project management,4
80181,Too much theory for me!,4
80184,Really interesting course.,4
80189,"Good one, more examples about real life situations would be valuable",4
80201,It was a good introductory course. Not much detailed but shows you the ins and outs.,4
80206,"Informative, basic, nuts and bolts information",4
80207,"This was a great mix of videos, reading material, and quizzes to keep me engaged.",4
80221,"It is most usefull course here i have joined I got a lot of infomation from, with high Efficiency!thanks at all!",4
80225,Excelent informationand videos,4
80233,Good info,4
80240,"Very good high-level intro to PMBOK-based project management. The UC Irvine classes are not particularly demanding, and won't by themselves prepare you to take the PMP exam, but they will give you a decent grounding in the terminology and principles involved.",4
80247,"This course packed a lot in and was very direct and efficient, giving helpful examples to illustrate the points. The project management tools learned can be applied in so many situations even for those of us who will never have the official title of ""project manager"". Videos are supplemented by flash lessons that go over the information, which was great for learners who may not learn as well by video alone. I would have liked one or two written assignments, but quizzes were relevant to the information provided and it was nice not to have to wait on peer-reviews. Overall, a great course.",4
80277,A great kind of teaching by the professors!,4
80279,"I just finished week 2 (of 6) and I feel like I am learning. I am taking this course because I am an entrepreneur and would like to acquire tools and techniques and explore processes that can help me manage my company's projects. Though we are a year in, this is a great guide for starting to rein in runaway work and control the processes of the organization.",4
80280,It's a very interesting course in order to get a overview about all processes involved in project management and how important they are.,4
80281,Good course with best reading materials,4
80283,A very good course which taught me several things on Initiating and planning projects. The course was simple and very clear.,4
80284,Lessons are not compatible with tablets.,4
80286,A good starter on the topic of project management!,4
80288,"Well structured course, great presenter, really interesting materials, overall the whole 3 Part course is well worth doing. The bonus videos that the presenter does on real life examples are excellent and I've watched some of them multiple times. The course is useful not only aa good introduction to PM tools and techniques but also to reinforce what the role of the project manager actually is.",4
80302,"This course was tremendously helpful for someone who, like myself, may have a background in planning but was never taught a formal approach to it. It really was a pleasant surprise to find this course.",4
80306,I think it should have a webboard to ask between teacher and student or other students.,4
80310,"I like this course , iit's full of good information about projects managmentThaks coursera !",4
80313,"Course goes over the most basic points, but also allows you (if you are interested) to dive much deeper into the content. Seems it has everything any project manager would want, so definitely worth taking. Would have wanted the questions to be a little more difficult and potentially more questions to help make sure the information was retained. Overall a great course.",4
80314,"The course was very helpful for undersatnding basic concepts in project management, with interesting and insightful use cases. The pacing is excellent, lectures are just the right length to not get you overfluded with information.",4
80316,"The content is great, but the most part is presented using flash-based pages :/",4
80322,It's really a good course to take a first step in project management,4
80323,A good course introducing Project management,4
80329,Very clear and well organized,4
80331,The course is well organized and useful. The slide is illustrative and clear.,4
80333,Simple and direct. It is a perfect introduction to basic project management terminology.,4
80337,Need to download the reading lessons for offline reading,4
80344,"This course was extremely valuable to me. Theoretical knowledge especially. My two points for possible improvement, most probably subjective, would be:1.The course is too slow-paced. There is a bit too much of an auxiliary talk, which may distract from the essential knowledge.2.While the course offers some state of the art practical examples, a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important points.Lastly, at every start of the week, I was asked to do a test quiz to asses my knowledge from that week. This is very strange. The test quizzes should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week, AFTER I have acquired knowledge, and not before.",4
80346,"This course helps me much in real life. It improves my negotiation skill in many situations of life.But I think it has a little bit much US's law, it is not really helpful for everybody, but some specific region.",4
80347,"Course is great, it might be helpful in negotiations at every aspect of life. It also shed the light onto aspects of different laws and contract rules. Still, the final grade is a bit complex taking into account the previous ones are light.",4
80351,Great course. Lays out the process of proper negotiation well.,4
80353,"This is a very dense course, offering a quite detailed information and technique on negotiation. While the focus is very much on business deal negotiations, one can pick up transferable skills to apply in other areas. While the knowledge gained through this course is not directly applicable in my area of work, it is a useful course to have taken.",4
80356,"The course is great, but the title was misleading for me. I would call it ""Contract Negotiation"", because there is a lot of information on the laws and the specifications of contract signing that I think are too specific to be present in a general negotiation course. Other than that, the teacher is great and the tests/exams also allow for a continuous notion of our progression.",4
80361,I think this course is helpful and we can learn a lot from it.,4
80364,must take course to understand negotiation skills techniques and step by step introduction to negotiation.,4
80367,Very Nice issue,4
80375,Definitely a great program. Great way to up skill yourself!!! Thanks to coursera and UM.,4
80378,it was great experience being a part of this course,4
80412,"Would like more exercises to test knowledge throughout the course, not just one large exam at the end. Would prefer less choices on final exam questions to better demonstrate one's knowledge of material, not test-taking skills.Professor Siedel is a wonderful professor with many years of both theoretical and practical knowledge. His real-world examples allow students to apply course materials beyond academia to the business world and life in general.",4
80416,Quite interesting with lots to learn.,4
80428,"Could be summarised in parts, but generally good course.",4
80437,Straightforward and engaging!,4
80442,Very interesting and enriching course. It gave me more than what I expected. Definitely a must for young negotiators,4
80448,"Interesting, understandable, and logical",4
80459,I enjoyed the modules and learnt newer concepts which are not only applicable in business but also in everyday life. Thank you!,4
80466,Generally good course. Very brief information about the tactics.,4
80484,"This course is excellent, the only problem is that french subtitles do not cover all videos.",4
80485,"Overall a good course content. However, more shorter examples would have helped retain the content better.",4
80486,"Great course! Very useful negotiation techniques. It's not easy to pass the final exam which you can see the level of the curse. I've enjoyed practicing with the exercises, especially with ""The house of Elm Street"" exercise.",4
80489,"tough, but well worth it !",4
80495,a lot of great and helpful knowledge,4
80503,"For me, this course was very thought-provoking. The professor gave many examples to make sure students understood the study materials. It was very interesting and challenging course. Even for someone who doesnt have skills in negotiation, this course definetely helped me to understand how to negotiate with structure and how to use it. Every penny was worth it!",4
80515,nice course worth learning,4
80523,Very well taught in such a manner that is so easy for understand even for people with no-law background.,4
80529,I find the course is very interesting..,4
80537,"I thank Professor George Siedal and Coursera for the course. It was useful and enjoyable experience while doing this course. I joined this course to learn regarding negotiations but I also ended up learning about contracts,mediation and arbitration.",4
80548,Very Good!,4
80561,It's a good course!just a observation that isn't 100% translated. Tasks and evaluation is in english.,4
80563,Very useful course. Thanks professor!!!,4
80569,"I loved it, it was my 1st MOOCs",4
80575,I find this course especially helpful in my everyday life. Interesting thing is that I was selling my apartment while I was litsening to this course and this may be my biggest motivation to follow up this course as I want to negotiate an ideal selling price.,4
80581,"Learned a lot in this course, even though I was not new to the subject. Great review of psychological traps and biases to avoid, and a nice overview of third party and alternative resolution options. THANKS Professor Seidel for making all of this knowledge available!",4
80593,"Friendly, nice professor.",4
80595,"This was a very good course covering negotiation theory from a very interdisciplinary perspective. It covered behavioral sciences, game theory, and interpersonal communications aspects with potential implications to negotiation.",4
80596,Have fall in love with negotiation.,4
80599,Dr. Siedel is extremely informative when it comes to breaking down the roles people play in any negotiation and the intangible aspects of the transaction overall. I recommend this course to anyone in a sales position or in corporate positions that conduct a lot of B2B transactions.,4
80601,Excellent course for anyone interested in improving their negotiation skills. Ever since the first lesson I have started looking at the business world from a new perspective. The book is a great read and not too exhaustive.,4
80615,Great course. Interesting stuff. Bit too much legal aspect to my taste.,4
80618,It does open your mind and makes you think logically within the boundaries.,4
80633,Very clear and very usefull,4
80645,Very useful framework to use when negotiating. Totally helpful the practical activity to do an overall review.,4
80646,Very good and useful technics with lots of examples to help you understand and memorize,4
80653,great course and great teacher,4
80656,"Simply Best ! I liked the course work, kept the interest intact and is worth knowing.",4
80663,"Very very good! Professor Siedel, thank you very much.I missed more math, but I think It would be a different course then.Recommended.",4
80666,Excellent course. Useful tips for professional and personal life.,4
80668,well structured. should be more focused on practical applications. the final exam could be more hands on on cases than on definitions.,4
80689,very useful,4
80691,"Great for everyone, almost essential to non-businessmen or lawyers.",4
80701,"very good introduction, over focus on legal terms to my opinion, but most of the course deal with how to nego' and how to make successful nego'.",4
80714,"This course is challenging, but if you stick with the deadlines and take the exam within the timeline you will learn the content deeply. There is a lot of usable information in this course whether it is for personal or professional use.",4
80722,Great content!,4
80723,"Exceptional practical knowledge well explained examples, one confusing part was in the final exam multiple choice of the answer option titled ""two of the above"" as the student should be able to select 2 each of the 2 answers or this option is redundant in my opinion other wise overall really enjoyed the course.",4
80727,Great course! Thank you very much Professor!,4
80743,"This course was really useful and Prof. Siedel is such a great person. It is a pleasure listen to his lectures that were more like stories. I however would have liked to have little quizzes in between the weeks to review the content. It adds up quite a lot and even taking notes, at the end some info gets missing. I definitely recommend this course though. I am sure I will do much better in my next negotiation.",4
80744,"The way professor Mr. G. Siedel conducted the course is very practical and useful. Invites always to ""think about answers"" to complex questions and his new approaching techniques to negotiate with success are truly useful to analyze your behave negotiating, and therefore , improve in the negotiation techniques and knowledge of tools and different approaches to a negotiation.",4
80758,"Excellent delivery, very simple and in depth analyses of the negotiation process.",4
80768,Great and effective,4
80780,Some of the speeches are really very long and need patience to finish. I'm happy that he exam is much easier and takes not very long time to get passed.,4
80781,Very useful framework introduction!,4
80790,My personal opinion is that every lawyer needs to master the art of negotiation and this is one of the best if not the best platform to initiate that process. I would say specifically that I have learnt a lot and I believe this would give me an edge over lawyers that have no idea about this in my country (NIGERIA).Thank you very much coursera for giving people like me an opportunity to know and understand more. You are truly creating a world without educational boundaries.,4
80793,"Excellent material and methods, i found the course extremely useful and practical",4
80798,"mostly it was good, should have quizzes in each section",4
80799,Useful and insightful,4
80801,Very interesting course and useful tools for negotiation.,4
80805,"From every lesson, I learn things that not only applicable in negotiation but also in daily life. Thank you.",4
80814,"The professor is well-knowledged and able to provide very high quality course. I do lean a lot from his class.Though English is my second language, prof. George's explanation is very clear, easy to understand and on the point. The videos help a lot when i was learning. It's more efficient and memorable than reading the book (i also purchase the book and write notes during my learning).Generally, I's satisfied by the knowledge I learned so far. Due to device limitation, i, prof, and other students may not able have interaction which may influence our learning quality (Negotiation required a lot of practice and experiences). But I still can see our prof's effort on making this class memorable to us.At the end, Thank you Prof. George for providing meaningful education.",4
80816,"Very good course, structure, content, and engaging fellow students -- big Thanks UofM! :))",4
80824,"Some strategies I learnt, I would have never thought of. An interesting course and quite enjoyable. A great course for any business person who needs the essential ingredients for negotiating. Thank you to the lecturer and much appreciated.Perhaps a little additional material to give it some depth? I just felt a little more was needed to validate the material to put what we learn into practice. But apart from that, a worthwhile course for anyone that needs to negotiate in their business. I am sure I will refer back to this from time to time, as some pointers will help keep you in focus with your strategies.",4
80833,"more interaction and ongoing assignments would be better, but really great course!",4
80837,Very instructive although there wasn't enough practical cases fo me.,4
80838,A perfect course which teaches you the basics of negotiation.,4
80842,Great but I strongly recommend you watch the videos on 1.5X speed as the prof talks a bit slowly,4
80850,Valuable and not too time consuming.,4
80852,"It is a quite well structured course. Is missing a little bit ""flash"" to become more incentive, attractive. Negotiation is part of ""sell and buy"" something and many times is not only a scheme of calculus, could be also sentimental decision and in this case is difficult to determine the right value (value creation is like a bubble soap, nice but easy to break).",4
80855,It was an useful course. I believe that I will use the tools learned in this course.,4
80865,The course content was good.,4
80866,"There should be ""fast tests"" after each class. So that I could check my understanding of the topic.",4
80867,"great course, informative and challenging.",4
80868,I liked so much this course and the teaching way of the its teacher.,4
80871,"4/5: Professor is a good teacher and very well versed in the material, which is very relevant. Only issue I had, which justifies a solid 5/5 becoming a 4/5 in my opinion, was that it was a little too slow.",4
80881,Very efficient tools for negotiating,4
80883,"very useful, practical,and brilliant !!!",4
80886,"Great way of teaching, interesting, not boring at all. Usefull in the life of everyday.",4
80887,Just awesome!,4
80888,Good course,4
80890,Good course,4
80900,"This course is focussing on negotiation in business.But the presented concepts and strategies can be used in private negotiations of all kinds.I found the legal aspects of negotiation of contracts rather boring, but then you can watch the videos in double speed.All in all a very useful course for me.",4
80907,"He is certainly a very good teacher, but he is boring.He uses this same monotonous tone,but seeing the content it does help us understand.",4
80920,"Interesting, focused on relevant matters, practical. Enriched with many examples and one involving practical exercise. I would have appreciated questions after each lesson block.",4
80922,A very good insight to another way of negotiating. I am only half way through but already thinking differently.,4
80924,Great course. Enjoy it!,4
80925,"This course covers all the bases of general negotiation. The professor is well traveled and credentialed in his field and gives very frank, matter-of-fact presentations of the material. The only thing I would change about the course is that I would have periodic check-up quizzes to help the learner gauge his/her understanding.",4
80931,Well structured negotiation strategies that would be applied with more discipline and evaluation of the the end result in mind.,4
80934,"Very interesting and useful.Mr Siedel is bright and explains well.The whole course is worth spending time on it, even if you have the experience in negotiations already.It helps to rationalise and don't forget any aspect of the negotiation process up to the conclusion.Some concepts could be difficult to really understand if you don't get already an exposure to the American business culture.",4
80948,I thnk it's a great online course. The only thing missing is a little more interaction with the professor with peers. Recommended.,4
80952,World class teacher. Fine contents with a very useful legal approach that is often missed in introductory negotiation courses.Compared to other Coursera MOOCs I missed support materials or further readings. Additional assignments and cases could be included.,4
80960,Very useful course!!! It gives you important tools to succeed on a business environment as negotiation is involved in almost every situation of our lives.,4
80971,Very good and interesting course with lots of information on how to negotiate.,4
80972,This is a very interesting course. It is the first course I followed on Coursera and it worth my time and money. Various skills and strategies are being taught which I took for granted before. This course is helpful both for the day-to-day negotiation and for business ones.,4
80975,Needs a little more of a breakdown on Decision Trees caculations.Great course though.,4
80983,"I like it, overall. It can tax your mental capacity with an incoming stream of novel, technical vocabulary delivered vigorously by a knowledgeable teacher. It was hard to capture all without much time for reflection and making connections between pieces. I'd rather prefer dense slides and slower, simpler, big-picture oration.",4
80984,i like this course!,4
80992,"It was a decent but definitely surface-level introduction to the concepts surrounding Web App development. A wealth of vocabulary is defined. There's just too much material to cover in one class to understand any one concept deeply. However, a broad array of basic concepts are introduced and I benefited from taking the class.",4
80993,"Very, very interesting course. Clear lessons and nice new concepts.",4
80994,Enjoying the course,4
80997,good course - give the big picture perspective. especially if you using ruby on rails!,4
81005,A really nice course. I would have wanted more about polymers.,4
81010,Very good course,4
81014,Gives brief understanding of almost every aspect Materials engineering. Effort is required from the side of student to understand the concept wholly. Many complicated topics are dealt with with relative ease and from basics.,4
81020,Pretty good teacher. Easy words for not native-speakers. German subtles would be great.,4
81022,"A very organized and well guided course. However, the contents are fairly difficult for a pre-university students.",4
81041,"This course was engaging and interesting, and helped form a thorough understanding of analyzing finances and interpreting financial statements.",4
81042,The information presented by the professor are valuable but I think we there should have been more practical exercises to enforce the concepts that being learnt.,4
81043,This course allowed me to use the knowledge i gained from the previous course (accounting principles)and i will recommend for all start ups or SME owners.,4
81044,"Very good course, thank you.",4
81049,"Easier than the last course I took to follow, however, still this contains ""advanced"" information when it is supposed",4
81055,Concepts are explained in clear and efficient manner. However more emphasis should be laid on problem solving.,4
81056,"Great course, shows a clear overview of the world economy and how it works.",4
81065,I like the way this course was structured and the clear presentation from Professor Navarro.,4
81066,"For someone who has no background on macroeconomics, this course taught me a great deal.",4
81071,Very good. It gives me many insight,4
81072,More explanations using graphs would be helpful in better understanding how to use graphs to represent economic phenomena,4
81078,"Really solid analysis from Trump's top economic advisor. I point that out as a warning before you start, but it was really and truly a useful and well-taught course. I highly recommend it. Best to come into the course with some level of background in economics, but Prof. Navarro breaks things down well in the videos.",4
81084,it's quite good I think. I learns a lot.,4
81090,"Good introductory courses to macro-economy. Don't cost too much time each week and you learn a lot. But due to its brevity, many materials can not go deep. Especially for the last two weeks, the materials are mostly descriptive, lacking scientific models. I have to search for other materials to better understand it.",4
81092,Great. Really informative,4
81107,nice explanation of concepts. good for newbies to the domain,4
81112,Good introduction to the world of Macroeconomics with rundown on real world principles.,4
81114,Great course. Recommended.,4
81116,Engaging presentation; maybe slides resolution could be improved,4
81117,This course is very well structured and provides an overall glimpse of the vast field of Macro Economics.,4
81127,Love this course,4
81130,"The course content is really good. However, in the last module, some sentence restructuring would be appreciated.",4
81135,"This course breaks down macroeconomics to a level that a beginner can understand, however, I wish the instructor had made available downloadable notes in either PDF or PowerPoint with the examples, graphs, key points etc. It would have been very helpful as study tools.",4
81137,"I enjoyed a lot the course. Every Brazilian is a soccer coach and an economist, so I was very confortable with the topics and most of the content was more or less known, indeed.The best is that it does not seem to follow excessively on a ideological line. It seems to be open minded. I think it is great!Its excessive focus on industrialized countries is understandable. I think the last module about developing world seems too simplistic. I also think that opinions about american positions in the economic arena and happenings is somehow benevolent.I expected a more mathematical approach, but I see that it may not make sense since it is a introductiory course.I have not liked the exams, though, specially the final exam. They are much more about memorizing than deep understanding.",4
81145,"Nice Course.However, it will better to have the slides. It is hard to review a specific concept with videos.",4
81148,Excellent overview! it's nice to find out how the things are tied together...,4
81152,"Great refreshment or intermediary/intro course- too much focus on the US system at first and perhaps a disproportionate focus on schools of thought, but extremely useful, pragmatic and learner friendly.",4
81153,ery thorough and fast paced-just a little dry.,4
81159,Great program. I spent most of my summer and fall completing this great online course. Now I understand a little bit better the Fiscal Policy and Monetary policy!ThanksAlejandro.,4
81168,"Good guide of Macroeconomics, but there are some sensitive contents for learners of China in the last few weeks.",4
81169,"Great course. Very easy to understand, effective slides, somewhat challenging tests, clear voice by the professor, professionally done. The only gripe I have is feeling like I did not learn as much as I wanted to. I do not think this is reflective of the professor or his style, it may have to do more with the subject. Macroeconomics is a social science, not much intense, groundbreaking material. Overall good, I would suggest it if you want a broad understanding of macroeconomic theories, the history, and its implications.",4
81175,"I think the best part of this course is its diversity. The course is so well structured that theories of several important school of economics are discussed, with their applications in the history.",4
81177,"tl;dr : I recommend it.Good introduction to macroeconomics. Gives lots of insights and mechanisms. Long course, but it was necessary. A second part would be much appreciated, maybe with more econometrics to give a measure to all these effects.",4
81178,Well paced course with a wide overview if a bit americo-centric,4
81184,Offers immense knowledge about the macroeconomics and its impact on the real world.,4
81189,"very interesting courses, but there is written material that you can go when you want to refresh concepts.",4
81194,is cool,4
81198,Answers are always the first option. I don't like that.,4
81200,"It's very useful and interesting, but sometimes not very obvious statements are being discussed very briefly.",4
81212,The videos and content were engaging.,4
81213,Comprehensive!,4
81214,"Although the course cover everything there can be in Macro-economics, the course is tightly bound with US economy. Also the questions, some of them, in quiz are exact from the slides. I think there could have been changes. None the less, it was best thing i have learnt in past 6-12 months. Awesome going through it.",4
81229,Very Good course for beginners in Economics. Very well explained principles using real-life examples and history as well. One thing I might suggest is maybe update the course regularly so that some of the things you say about developing nations are consistent with what is actually being observed today. I'm from Kenya as it is and I found some of the material very media-sensitized for developed nations.,4
81253,"This course contains lots of important information about how to optimise a website for SEO, especially Module 1, keyword research and competitive analysis. I've been rewatching Module 1 as I'm working on optimising two websites. Because there is so much information I felt sometime the logical order could have been reemphasised. Other than this, really great course.",4
81256,"Although the course was quite good, it wasn't really relevant to me as it was very focused on the USA (especially the local seo part)",4
81276,"Excellent course. Learned a lot on the nuts and bolts of optimisation. Some of the promised downloads are missing, though, in the resources section. Same goes for a few links. But the links one can look up one ones own. Not so the downloads. And there have been no response despite repeated posts in the Help section. Hope this will be remedied.",4
81277,"Once again a good course but the quizzes are improvable. I had 98%, I don't say it because I didn't know the answers. Many questions just don't make sense. Other than that the course was very interesting!",4
81279,I liked the course but most of the things were common sense for me.,4
81290,"I learned a lot from this course, but was disappointed that some of the information and downloads referenced were missing.",4
81291,"Generally a good course. I was disappointed with the instructions in the Week 3 assignment. In past courses within the certification, the instructions have noted specifically what was required. Here, the instructions around the Google Business Page part of the assignment did not include some specific elements we were being evaluated one.",4
81295,This course focuses a lot on local site optimization and how to proceed SEO projects.,4
81300,Great opportunity to discover how LOCAL SEO works,4
81307,"Great content. Explores the machine learning techniques with the tightest coupling of statistics with computer science. The Probabilistic Graphical Models series is one of the harder MOOCs to pass. Learners are advised to buy the book and actually read it carefully, preferably in advance of listening to the lectures. The quality of the course is generally high. The discussion is a little muddled at the very end when practical aspects of applying the EM algorithm (for learning when there is missing data) is discussed.",4
81316,"This course was an interesting introduction to positive psychology, it possess a strong resemblance to my beliefs, concepts and ideologies from Buddhism. I would certainly recommend this course to my colleagues and friends. Kudos to the team.",4
81362,"This course allowed me to gain a deeper insight into understanding my emotions and how they affect me and those around me, it enabled me to regulate my emotions and understand the emotions of others.",4
81366,"This course could give more examples about how we can implement positive psychology within our workplace for example. Some videos could have included more slides to be more informative and dynamic. Overall, it was a very interesting course. Thanks!",4
81376,"Enjoyed the course. Very informative. Though Prof. Barbara is an introvert herself, her advocating face to face interactions made me rethink possibilities in my daily routine for such an experiment. Hopefully my results will be as good as the science claims. :)",4
81380,Good class. The discussion format with the group chatting was a little tedious even though the information was interesting.,4
81388,"Information was nice, expressed in a simple way and it was nice to watch the lectures. I do not think the course went in deep enough into psychology and kept the subject very superficial, which was a shame because of the potential it holds in today's world.",4
81392,"The Professor, the research and the practical applications make this a fantastic course! Very thought provoking. My only suggestion would be perhaps more engaging videos.",4
81397,"I really enjoyed it. The only thing was I had to read the scripts on the videos in order to follow the thoughts and ideas because I'm used to read and understand faster than in the way you expressed the ideas. Other than that it was a great course. Very enlightening. And also gave me hope for psychology since most of whet we study at school is about problems and pathologies, never solutions.",4
81403,"Really good, but to short!",4
81410,Skills I will use everyday.,4
81415,"I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman's Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology. I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved (the studies Dr. Fredrickson refers to are for the most part only touched on briefly), and to have spent less time listening to the on-site students discussing their personal opinions (though I appreciated their insights, I would have liked to have learned more actual information).I did get something out of the experiential activities. Although they are optional, I would recommend doing them to really get something out of the class. They allowed me to stop and think about things I may not have made the time for otherwise.",4
81416,"I had fun, that's a good sign. There is something to take away from this course for everyday living so that is good too.Perhaps I was expecting a bit more research discussions, it seemed all nice with the chats but maybe less 'pedagogic' than I might have expected.",4
81419,"Good class, knowledgeable professor. I would have preferred if some of the longer sessions (closer to 20 minutes) were split into two sessions. I didn't like the conversational style of this course, though, because it felt impersonal. It would have felt more personal to me if it had just been Dr. Fredericks on camera. I thought the session where Kelly Stacks was interviewed was worthwhile and good to include.",4
81433,"Great content, but too much video for me since i prefer reading about it.",4
81442,"I am just starting this course and finding the information clearly laid out; the slight difference of having a seminar group approach to presenting information from Dr. Frederickson (as opposed to the one 'talking head' approach of many courses) is fresh and new (though the colleagues are still a little 'stiff'... perhaps students rather than colleagues might have been interesting for us students, but I LOVE that her colleagues are committed to sharing in this learning!)All in all, I expect I will probably re-rate this course a 5 star once I am further in to it.I had taken the course 'A Lifetime of Happiness and Fulfillment' ALOHA-F) (see Indian School of Business) prior to this and recall Dr. Frederickson and her ""Broaden-and-Build"" Theory being sited. I absolutely LOVED the ALOHA-F course and I am very pleased to be able to find this course now as the last course made me want MORE!Enjoy",4
81459,"Great content and well presented, learned a lot and enjoyed the lessons. Thanks for making this available.",4
81461,Nice course but more detailed discussions could be carried out.,4
81464,"This is a nice and easy course. The chat sessions were fun and interesting. The professor got me interested enough to continue on to Tibetan Meditation because she touched on some related topics. She tried to make it a worthwhile experience, which it was. There were good interviews and good supplemental material. This was very worthwhile. Its a positive touch when course leaders take the time to dress well and make a good visual impression, as they would in a ""real"" physical classroom. I think that positive psychology could be a slippery topic, hard to substantiate in a way, but it was a door opener for me. I felt like this was a fine introduction to this area of psychology, which, if understood correctly, is beginning to blossom.",4
81467,"Excellent theories and lectures. The experiential activities suggested provided lots of learning experience and positive reinforcement of what we learned in the videos.I would hope for a more communicative or engaged team of ""classmates"" but on the other hand, their personal interviews were very interesting.",4
81480,"interesting but not usefull enough, maybe I have been going through the courses too fast",4
81482,"Useful, insightful, eye-opening. I highly recommend this course. Since lesson 1 I have been nurturing positive emotions (at home and at work) and reaping its emotional and physical benefits.",4
81484,"Great class on the fundamentals of positive psychology that anyone can grasp...I have enjoyed learning about paying more attention to my own positive emotions and creating better mental habits...the course is not as attention grabbing as some others that I've come across...and for whatever reason, my awareness of Dr. Fredrickson looking more to the audience on the left (to her right) while lecturing, distracts me...an oddity of mine, I'm sure...nevertheless, I'm very grateful for the opportunities and learning provided in this course... thank you!",4
81486,"One sweet, short course, providing the required answers to anyone interested in learning about Positive Psychology. Enjoyed it!",4
81512,"Great class, very applicable. I am glad I come across this class.",4
81518,Nice cours which is sometimes a littlebit difficult for not native speakers (english). Some words are unfamiliair and need translations to understand. Very good to follow and nice to learn.,4
81522,"Very interesting course. Fairly interactive. The structure could have been better to make it clear what we had learnt and give us more of a take away after each week and at the end. Although there were a lot of academic links each week, the course didn't explore the differing perspectives and ideas, it was more focussed on Barbara's own theories. Definitely a good introduction and great personal learning!",4
81525,a little slow but helpful course,4
81529,very helpful,4
81542,I think this is a vrey great course for all psychology lover because any one able to take a lot of information from this course in a very short time.,4
81543,A very good course but it was a little narrow because it focused on the professor's own research. Perhaps one or two lectures on other trends ad research results from the wider field of positive psychology would be apt.,4
81567,Thank you so much Dr.Barbara Fredrickson for making the connections to guide us to Positive Psychology !!! I will continue to learn more about Positive Psychology and Loving Kindness !!!,4
81577,"I found the presentation of the topic very convincing: I'll try to foster micro-moments of positivity resonance in the future and I am fully convinced that this will have a significant positive impact on my life.The videos were good: not too long and each making a point. I'm not a big fan of the round table format, but I admit it was appropriate for the topic.The only aspect where I see room for improvement is the type of assignments: the quiz was part of the course but the weekly exercise was not. It is maybe worthwhile to create some little assignments with a peer-review, to foster a deeper investment of the participants into the course.",4
81583,"Dr. Barbara L. Fredrickson is professional and the course is helpful for those who need positive emotion in lifes. But for those who learned psychology for years, this course is not challenging enough~",4
81587,"I really like this course. During my education, there wasn't much emphasis on positive psychology, and I think it's a shame because it seems like such an easy and enjoyable way to improve not only psychological, but also physical health. Only thing I would change- I would like the Course to be harder, in terms of quizzes. More facts about research and such.",4
81588,"A very interesting course, with many helpful tools.The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that i found it too easy.",4
81592,a good scientific course from one of the leaders of positive pscyhology. explains many key scientific evidences for happiness and positivity. good for curious learners. the course is free.,4
81596,EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE,4
81603,"Good information and very interesting thoughts! Everybody should familiar him/herself with this theory, could make us all a bit nicer, happier and positive!",4
81604,"Not particularly challenging, but a lot of extremely worthwhile information that just might change your life for the better. I'd recommend this course for anyone in a helping profession or that just wants to add positivity in their life.",4
81606,I thoroughly enjoyed this course and I can now approach my social interactions with a new perspective.,4
81613,"I've learned a lot from this course and I like the way to get ourselves enrolled in class. I think, however, this course only introduce a small part of positive psychology.",4
81626,This course is life changing! I listened to the book that Dr. Frederickson wrote called Positive Psychology on CD while I was taking the course and both of them put together gave me many strategies and scientific evidence of cultivating positive psychology and connection and the benefits. I would highly recommend this course to people looking to improve their lives.,4
81627,Love this course. Would have liked a little bit more depth in the studies and science around the topics presented.,4
81633,"I feel that the same monotone group of people, talking in a drab setting, was so monotonous it was difficult to keep focused on the lesson at hand. I know education is not supposed to be all zip, pow, bang, woah, and such, and I am not suggesting that it should be, but a little break from the drone tempo would be a nice addition. Other than that the course was on par and enjoyable. I liked the self meditative assignments most.",4
81638,Interesting course,4
81660,"As an introductory course, professor adequately addresses several of the misconception about positivity and emphasizes how to integrate some small rituals into life to bring out its effect. The healthy ratio between positivity and negativity is critical, and being positive doesn't mean you have to fake it.",4
81664,"I enjoyed the course and believe I learned something of value. I will say, however, that this is not a general course on Positive Psychology, but rather a focus on the professor's research on love and emotions in the field of Positive Psychology.",4
81665,"Professional, evidence-based. Nice arrangement with the four people. Beginning stunning, but at the end I sometimes had hard time with my attention:) Anyway - thank you, Barbara Fredrickson and all the people round the course, it was inspiring and pleasant.",4
81668,It was very interesting Course to develop your positive emotions and have a deep insight of it. Well explained and very Important course .,4
81671,Very interesting and useful. Could be a bit more fast-paced.,4
81675,some of the assessment was confusing - we were often tested on material we did not cover in the modules.,4
81677,"Thanks to the course,I've got the basic skills of web developing.",4
81680,The course was a bit too basic... I was hoping for slightly more difficult / comprehensive assignments.,4
81685,It was a great beginner course. Thanks for the Coursera and the course's faculty.,4
81688,Very good starting point. Great for beginners to get a grasp of the idea of each language.,4
81689,"Good overview, use of simple programs to demonstrate specific features, and ample references to online resources to go further.",4
81701,"Overall, this course was a great introduction to the basic web programming languages for someone with little to no experience. My only issue was that the assignments could have been more challenging, and one in particular was not put together properly by the instructors (missing information to complete assignment) this has since been fixed.",4
81704,A good bare basics introduction,4
81705,As basics it was good.,4
81708,"some glitches with assignments uploaded on the course, apart from that it is very good for folks who are new to HTML/CSS/JSthanks.",4
81712,This is a good introductory course,4
81717,Its a damn awesome coursethe main thing about this course is i didnt lose intrest in course till lastas most of the times i start the course but never complete it before.,4
81723,"It was very useful, it needs more practicing but seriously thank you ^_^",4
81724,"Good course but If you know a little bit about HTML , CSS and JavaScript this course won't be useful for you .",4
81731,Good for learning the basics.,4
81745,Simple and organized,4
81749,Great course keep up the good work!,4
81758,good course I like it and the way it was given.,4
81759,"I feel very satisfied with the learned topics, The videos are clearly and easy to understand and follow.",4
81760,I think it will be great a introduction of programing with js in a seperate course,4
81764,It's an incredible course with detail explanations and interactive quizzes.,4
81767,"Useful for people who want to know the very basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.",4
81768,Nicely maintained.,4
81771,the course is quite simple and informative. I really like how it is done as hands on experience not just lectures and assignments. I would definitely recommend it for beginners,4
81774,Sometimes lectures go too fast. Could dive more into css and javascript.,4
81779,"This course was really informative and the lessons were concisely executed. I recommend the course to anyone looking for a beginner's introduction to coding HTML/Javascript. My only criticism is that I'd like to have more peer-review projects to do, because I think letting other people check someone's work is a good way to see how they can improve.",4
81785,"The course is quite good, but it if you already have some knowledge about the subject and want to go deeper in it, this is probably not your course",4
81787,One of the best courses which I take.,4
81788,"Well course, well explained. It starts from the very basics for those ones that does not know much about web development.",4
81789,"The course was great and I will be happy to continue with the next one from the stack. There was only one thing, which I would improve - the JavaScript lessons. They were not well explained at all and quite often I felt lost in the videos. I needed to know why the code was written like that, why was there a dot and a space, etc, not see it already written and just go with it.",4
81790,Very easy to follow.,4
81797,A great beginner course if you're starting out from scratch.,4
81799,Good start for the specialization.,4
81801,"I would expect to know a little bit more about the details. For example, <div> why we use this tag so often?",4
81802,Very instructive and a good start up. I love the way the lectures are prtesented. helps you get the grab of the materials.,4
81810,"Great introduction to html, css, and javascript. I enjoyed it very much and will be continuing on with the rest of the series. Thanks.",4
81813,Very nice indeed. I learnt CSS this time. I can only say this that instead of teaching Jquery you can teach us in the same javascript syntax.,4
81816,"Very well organised, explained and delivered. Good introdution to good web development. The only aspect I would suggest changing is leaving code visible on screen while under discussion as I found myself going back to see the code after watching someone talk about it. Its nice to see faces but I would prefer to see code as it is being explained.",4
81818,"A short course consists of basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Little jQuery material is also included. It is a great course for me to review my knowledge in this area.I am not sure if this course contains enough knowledge for the beginners. Also more practical and guided assignments are needed. It will be great if the teacher includes a ""Recommended Book"" section, as shown in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/supplement/8VeLb/recommended-books) .",4
81825,very good course clear and concise,4
81828,Too simple but easy to understand. Thank you,4
81834,"It's a good course: short, simple but i think it's somehow difficult for people with no programming background.",4
81837,"I liked the course a lot and learned the basics of html, css and javascript. My main suggestions for improvement would be to extend the course over 8 weeks and spend more time on each subject. I also believe that if we were asked to do an assignment per week (so 8), it would have pushed us to deepen our understanding of the subject matter. That said, I very much enjoyed the course. I also love coursera and the work of all schools that participate with them. Thank-you and keep up the excellent work and valued effort !",4
81838,Good and practical course,4
81841,"Great course! I wish I could take a regular semester class, but good job with the amount of material included within this class. I'm looking forward to learning more from this specialty.",4
81842,Few example code are not well explained.But the whole course is proper for beginners learning web development !,4
81846,"I like this course, it`s fun and useful. But on the other hand it`s sometimes a bit difficult to follow the teacher as he`s sometimes doing things to fast. So I have to rewind and pause to see, what he did.",4
81847,Many MCQ in the quiz were out of the course we studied.,4
81849,"I like it, it`s useful and easy to follow . only need PDF transcript to download.",4
81860,Had Great fun Learning through this Web app...,4
81865,Well worth the time. This is an introduction class that I can put to use,4
81866,"A little bit more depth wouldn't hurt. I'll check also other courses in this specialization, so if this is just gentle introduction and then later courses goes deeper in the material, then fine, but if they keep the same difficulty level, then... hmmm",4
81870,"Like introductory course, is very good and very clear.",4
81874,Well presented content.It was a little bit weird for me to jump straight to jQuery and spending so little time on Javascript but it works out for the course. I would suggest a couple of more examples and explanation of general programming concepts with providing relevant pdf.Generally a very good and content-rich course.,4
81877,"This course was very well organized, but I felt there were big jumps between the lessons within the modules. I would follow fine up to parts 7 or 8 out of 9 or 10 total parts, and then I would be lost. I know there is quite a bit to HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the professors did a great job to separate the components. For a beginner, I would have liked to spend a bit more time on HTML and CSS for full comprehension before delving into JS.",4
81878,"The curse is good, but for me it only worked when I started some other larger courses of each topic separately; I mean, this works as a short overview of everythig, but otherwise, it jumps too quickly from a languaje to the next.",4
81880,"It shows the basics of each subject. A good start to learn the technologies HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.",4
81887,Good course for someone with a little experience. Total newbies may be lost doing the assignments. Regardless I recommend the course.,4
81890,"A quick and nice introduction to HTML, CSS and JS. If you have already done webdesign before, you can finish this course maybe in 1 week.",4
81891,Good class. Explanations are thorough and easy to follow. One improvement I could suggest is more specific projects than open ended ones.,4
81894,Great way the info is presented. When we get the summary quizzes we sometimes get questions on subject matter that we did not cover and need to research the answers. I do like the assignment so far as it puts into practice what we have learned during the module,4
81896,"I wouldn't mind if it meant one less certificate but I think it would be great if they let you test out of this and jump right into the 2nd course in the series. The first course is awesome for anyone whose never done any web design before, even if you have coding experience, but its absolutely excruciating for anyone with more basic knowledge of web design.",4
81897,Excellent course. However it does not go deep into the details.,4
81901,There were times I got lost on the explanations.However it is a great manner to begin,4
81905,"I've learned a good deal about coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript through this course. My only complaints are that the lecturer often whizzed through typing portions of the code during his lecture that I had to use more time than my schedule allotted reviewing the video slowly, and that some topics in the test questions didn't match any portion of the lecture.",4
81907,"Great introductory course. The HTML and CSS modules were flawless. The JavaScript module was interesting and useful, but I felt it moved too fast for a beginner, especially someone who doesn't program in any other language like myself. Overall loved it, and will highly recommend it to friends and co-workers. I had so much fun that I went ahead and signed up for the next MOOC!",4
81911,"Very great intro to the 3 main languages of web design. I feel it has given me a solid foundation with which to keeping building this skill set. Some parts, particularly Jquery moved too fast for me, and I had trouble grasping/retaining the jquery rules.",4
81914,"I really liked the course as a review of basics. However, the final assignment seemed a bit of a stretch from the course material.",4
81929,I like this course because it was jumping directly into latest and greatest of frameworks or libraries and making things easy to get started.The instruction give on assignment wasn't clear,4
81933,this is a very basic course about this three topic .,4
81936,Course provides latest languages in a nutshell. This is highly in demand stuff.,4
81938,"Useful course ... it gives me the bases to start coding a responsive website, i recommend !!",4
81939,"Good overall high level view of HTML, CSS, Javascript, presented in a easy and understandable manner. You will need to take more courses beyond this to get a solid understanding and practically use it, but this is a good start.",4
81948,Do this course more hardly,4
81950,Simplified and well presented!A big thank you to the instructors :),4
81956,"Great introductory course. Could be a bit longer, but considering the other available course and their close-knit curriculum this is not that big of a problem.",4
81962,Very basic course. More focus should have been on the responsive aspect of this course.,4
81967,"Not very thorough in my opinion. I would suggest students to finish the web design for everybody course first. It deals with the most important issues of web design such as accessibility, DOM and a lot more CSS in a good depth. This course kind of brushes up the surface and jumps straight to Bootstrap. This would not really be of much help to a beginner. I presume the courses in the rest of the specialization offer a good bit of explanation atleast. This would be a good course for anyone who wants to simply get things done though :)",4
81972,"I really like it!!!From easiest to hardest content, I´ve learn three programatio languages priciples",4
81978,the way through which teacher describe the concept is really good.,4
81981,The teaching is very clear. It will be better if there are more tests. Exercises are important in coding.,4
81982,"Greatly enjoyed the course - enrolled in the second ""Responsive web"" course of the series and am learning quite a bit.",4
81983,Pretty good. I learned alot in a short of amount of time.,4
81985,"Nice start, but i think you should try do more explanation to new material in your video.I am going to the next moduel!",4
81987,"Very good introduction to these different languages. However Javascript is a very tough one to begin with variables, if statements and loops, imho better look for a single course on Javascript.Very useful material and quizzes.",4
81994,other than the quiz.. everything else was good.. quiz was not challenging enough..,4
82001,Too young too simple. Basic.,4
82011,very nice fundamentals. I like the way they begin with the most basic elements. Then add on additional incremental elements to make the projects more sophisticated and our knowledgebase more sophisticated.,4
82013,"More concrete weekly assignments with less vague objectives, and more in-depth training materials would be better. Otherwise, a decent introductory course.",4
82014,"Good course on the basics and very helpful for just starting out. Foesn't teach too much programming theory, so for those who already know how to program, it's all you need to understand simple web development.",4
82016,"Sharing a satisfied amount of knowledge, overall very good. The HTML videos were excellent. The one thing missing is the methodology on how someone starts to think and makes JavaScript code that delivers a solution to a problem. How do we do our approach? Flow charts would really help on this matter.",4
82017,Very clear explanations,4
82019,The Javascript part is not quite clear,4
82020,"The course covered quite a decent amount of content, but personally I think it was a bit fast for a beginner.",4
82029,"Good concise overview of the basic web design languages - this is a good jumping off point for people looking to get in to Web Design.Keep in mind though, this covers a very large amount of material in a short amount of time. If you don't have any familiarity with coding already, you will likely need to do a lot of outside research to fill in the gaps.",4
82033,Good course for beginners. Introduces all the basic concepts. It helps to understand what a responsive website is.,4
82056,Very clear.,4
82058,"Not all of the required details were actually discussed. But still, rather nice course to get you started.",4
82063,Great stuff..will appreciate more hands on stuff,4
82072,Well presented material. Good combo of theory and code and good focus on practical coding side of things. Well laid out and easy to follow.,4
82075,"It's a good course.If I must complain about something is that, since the course covers a little too much too fast, the people that is not familiar with the subject might not understand the why or how of things explained.",4
82077,"I'm not completely new to html and even javaScript, but I've read the eloquent Javascript book and was left with a bag of knowledge quite detached from the reality ... What this course does is focussing on the application side of required/acquired knowledge.The course covers terminology and shows some basic examples, while for the rest, including the homework, expects learners to go and google. It is sort of guided self-learning process, which I'm more than comfortable with.I don't give the course 5 starts only because I suspect, that people, who are completely new to the subject, would find it difficult to stay motivated. I even think that rather bold anonymous function introduction will be a show stopper for many.",4
82083,It's a good start for everyone interested in the creation of responsive websites. It's easy in the beginning but then with JavaScript you have to read additional sources to get the whole picture.,4
82090,"HTML and CSS were stellar explanations. Matt really has a knack for adding humour to his lecture that kept me engaged and helped me understand as well. Cheers.The JS portion though was rough. I felt like Marko has an incredible amount of knowledge but the method of the lecturers, content, and layout was hard to grasp on a first-time go. I had to re-watch every lecturer in the JS and I still am having problems...It's obviously a difficult language though and I'm honestly not sure if there actually IS an easier way to teach it. Marko's enthusiasm really showed though, so it helped keep me coming back for more punishment~Great job all around to everyone! Really good beginner course.",4
82099,Great course! But the pace and content can be improved on. Issuing of lecture slides in pdf would definitely help too.,4
82101,Good introduction to responsive web design. Apt for total beginners even without programming experience.,4
82105,"Great explantions, I'd like it if it went deeper into javasciprt, maybe include jquery or angular",4
82107,"When they say basic, they mean BAAAASSSSIIIIC. Good course to start with if you're not used to web development. If you have developed web pages and web applications, this course will be a breeze.",4
82110,Really fun and informative course. Definitely recommend.,4
82111,"Well prepared lesson for those who has no background of coding. However, the topic is too wide to cover, so the depth of the lesson is not satisfying for those who already have some knowledge of coding.",4
82112,Nice job of simplifying the content. Simple and clear examples provided removing all the code that is unrelated to the topic at hand! Well worth taking for those new and for those wanting to get a refresher on the topic.,4
82120,It is a good course but rather for real beginners on a basic level. But everything is clear.,4
82123,Better have some coding experience before.,4
82130,In my subjective opinion there were a lot of time spended to explain some simple thing that probably could be easier to learn just doing more examples. Anyway it is very interesting and it seems you can teach us much more so I am waiting for the future courses. Thank's and see you soon!,4
82136,"Nice introduction course, i liked more the ""style"" and html part that the JS indeed, but both are need to make good things ^^",4
82140,"I wish the course was structured differently, I liked it overall, though",4
82146,"I'd like to see more theoretical basics about HTML and CSS, not only ""we can type this and do that"" and ""I encourage you to find this information in Google""",4
82148,"I have worked on Oracle's proprietary systems and just wanted to know how are several awesome websites are made with html, css, javascript, jquery etc. Thank you so much guys...",4
82152,"Good intro to the subject and good mix of technologies, I enjoyed the time learning.Especially I did like the flexibility learning besides my Job.",4
82165,"Straightforward, quality content.",4
82173,"Nice introductory course in responsive web design. It might be a little fast for students with close to none experience with HTML and CSS, however all the examples given were explained very wel.",4
82183,Many simple things explain too much cleverly,4
82184,i wish the bootstrap and jquery would've been taught instead of referencing,4
82199,Great course. Thought I knew everything about e-mails and memos. I will use what I learned on the job.,4
82201,I loved the brief history and the subtle etiquette matters that were discussed. Many thanks for this!,4
82205,Very helpful with a lot of tips and resources to practice. Thank you.,4
82207,I liked this course but I wish the free part included the Quiz!!!,4
82223,"The course is well organized and gives a general understanding on what corruption, how it harms society and firms and some ideas on how it could be controlled. Taking it is a good idea if you want to have a general understanding on those topics. However I would prefer a deeper analysis, discussion and more material to have a better understanding on the topic.",4
82231,"Through this class, I made many sad conclusion about where I grew up. It also opened my eyes that corruption is more than just bribery. A very good all-around analysis of the phenomenon.",4
82234,An outstanding addition to your MBA education!,4
82235,Very interesting course and professor Nichols is very likeable. The one thing I would improve is the quality of the notes.,4
82243,"Good design projects, but very difficult at some times",4
82254,¡ Muy buen curso ! ¡ Tks !,4
82259,Great content for newbies.,4
82263,I really liked it! But I thought it was to programming Android apps,4
82264,Pretty good course as part of the specialization.,4
82275,Very good teacher and very good practice examples! More theoretical explanations on how the framework works would have been welcomed (where the templates of the packages dowloaded are stored for instance) !!,4
82296,"While I was primarily taking this course as a prerequisite for the next course in the specialization (which covers MongoDB in a bit more depth), I found this to be a well-organized introduction to a compelling framework. The instructor did a good job of presenting the content in a way that should be accessible for new developers, while still being relevant to experienced developers looking to round out their skills by learning a new framework.Acknowledging that this is a review of the course and not the framework, it's worth noting that Meteor itself is promising in its ability to quickly deploy sophisticated client-server web applications. My firm has well-established boilerplate templates based on Node.js and Gulp.js and a few dozen dependency packages that satisfy many of the same capabilities, but which were developed over a period of months and come with a much steeper learning curve. The scope of modern capabilities that Meteor offers out-of-the-box for ""free"" is quite impressive, and allows developers to dive into the interesting parts without the overhead of configuring services and establishing a build process.My only criticism is the cost, if you're looking to attain a verified certificate. At least from the perspective of a professional developer, the course was a bit light on content by comparison to other Coursera classes with the same pricing structure. I was able to complete the initial coursework in less than a week, while still attending my day job (although it did take additional time to complete the course project). Ultimately, this would be more compelling at a $49 price point, at least relative to other Coursera offerings.",4
82300,"Great course. The final assignement is a bit difficult compared to the course's teaching though. It did push me to do a bit of research on the web (which is good), but it would have been great to have a bit more explanations on how to develop features such as search or websites suggestion (I have no idea whatsoever if my implementation was correct).",4
82305,great course to start learning meteor js,4
82309,"This is a nice course to start with meteor. At times seems little slow, but can understand as it caters broader audience with different background. Highly recommended for anybody who wants to start with Meteor.",4
82315,"This was an amazing course, the only thing that was a bit of a let down was the fact that it is not updated to the last Meteor.js version, but still an amazing teacher and excellent material!",4
82323,"Mr. Yee-King is a gifted instructor. The course content is presented in an intelligible and clear manner.The only downside (as with many web development courses on Coursera) is that there is no section on how to deploy a Meteor project to the web. According to my own experience, this is not trivial as the long list of issues on the github pages of mup and mupx shows. Of course, there is a business logic behind this: simplicity and developer friendliness comes at a price - Meteor needs a return on investment, which is achieved through charging for deploying on Meteor's Galaxy web backend.Another proposal for improvement: the peer review form does not reflect the tasks of the final project well. Especially the section on the challenges should be more differentiated and should contain an item for each challenge.",4
82326,"This was a bit more difficult because the final project, some of it you really had to research online and read tons of documentation. I'm still not familiar with all the packages suggested for the final project.",4
82341,It's a good course if you want to learn meteor but a lot of people would like to have support at discussions from a professor since a lot of questions stay unanswered or with wrong answers.,4
82344,Very good learnig about the basics of this awesome framework.,4
82345,Good introduction into Meteor. The Pace is good and the instruction is engaging. The last assignment can be a bit tricky for the challenges.,4
82376,"Great intro to Meteor, it gets better at the last 2 weeks",4
82377,Keep on the hard work!,4
82390,Good course.,4
82392,"A great introduction to Meteor.js. I really appreciated the simplicity of each module. I found the final assignment to be easy to get passing marks, but just the right challenge to get full marks. Totally recommended if you want a quick introduction to the buzz that is Meteor.",4
82397,This has been a really awesome subject that has taught me alot in relatively little time. We need more introductions like this one please! A more advanced meteorjs subject would be great.,4
82412,"Actual rating would be 4.5/5 but Coursera doesn't allow for half stars.Great introduction to Meteor.js, overall. The professor covered the *how* very well with lots of examples and follow-along coding, but I wished there was a little bit more content on *why* Meteor does what it does.",4
82416,"A very straightforward and simple course. Since it's part of a Specialisation which is aimed at newbies, I wouldn't recommend it for people experience in JavaScript. But its pretty great for someone with minimal web dev or js experience",4
82419,The Course content is good.And the teacher is awesome...he explains everything quite well.,4
82424,Amazing course for beginner.,4
82432,I like this course,4
82435,Great intro to meteor.js for those with an basic programming understanding (preferably familiar with JS already but not necessary if you have other language knowledge).,4
82456,A very interseting way to do a lot of things without a very few code!,4
82459,"Good course and good introduction to Meteor.js. I knocked it down one star because the assignments are not as effective as they could be. Weeks 1-3 are short, easy quizzes. Only in week 4 is there a programming assignment, and it is a doozy. More than 6 hours for me--nothing like the 30 minutes it claims (however, I will point out it was a good assignment and I learned a lot).I think if the assignments were structured more like the U of Hong Kong web development courses this would be a five star course.",4
82463,very detailed explanation by the instructor; but the content seems too easy,4
82464,Great course- organized in a very friendly form ( a lot of others courses are simply boring and after few minutes of listening to the lecture you simply can't stand it ). Here the lectures are relatively short ~10 min and focused on single topic.Looking forward for the next course in the specialization.,4
82469,Great Course,4
82471,Very explanatory and quite deep,4
82475,Very good introduction! I hope it continues to the next level!,4
82489,TOUT EST PASSE DANS UNE BONNE CONDITION. CE COURS EST PARFAIF,4
82495,"The course lectures are even better than PGM I, as it appears that Professor Koller has recorded some material recently that helps fill in small holes from the previously recorded lectures. Hopefully she'll have time to clean up PGM I in the near future for future students.This course is another tour-de-force for debugging, though it definitely made me a better programmer (I'm intermediate). I wish that the Discussion Boards were more active, and it's a shame that the Mentors were Missing In Action. On the one hand, the programming instructions were sometimes a bit vague, which made the assignments less like assignments are more like research projects. For these 2 reasons, the course is 4-star rather than 5-star.Still, it's a lot better than trying to learn this out of the book by oneself. Some say enrollment has dropped off since they began charging for getting access to Quizzes and Programming Assignments. Or it may be attrition, as these are pretty challenging (and well taught) courses. I'm very happy to support this course financially, as it's loads cheaper than what I'd be paying if I were back at Stanford.Like PGM I, I strongly recommend doing the Honors Programming Assignments, as it's really the way to learn the material well.",4
82496,The course reminds me of my math lessons: lots of formulas and apparatus but little motivation (except in the optional videos). As in the first part of the specialization the advised book about PGM is highly recommended. To pass the final exam the book or at least some research papers are necessary (-1).,4
82501,"Not really introductory to people with very little background or familiarity with the field, but the notes are very good.",4
82506,For me it was for eye opening into the world that is smaller than us and the principles that control that make the universe what it is.,4
82526,It was an excellent course of a subject I am currently interested.,4
82539,was very useful course,4
82540,This course is simple but focus on the knowledge you must learn about the most important parts of Perfect Tenses and Modals in English grammar. The course offers enjoyable and useful videos and a lot of examples. I recomend it.,4
82543,"I would like to have direct feedback instead of just reviews like: "" review your tenses, or review your grammar"" I mean, I would like to know exactly where is my mistake, and how to correct it.Good course, I really learned to much about the tenses.",4
82545,Great Course indeed,4
82547,Great!,4
82563,It's a very good course.It's a pity that we need to pay to be able to submit assignments.,4
82564,"The course is informative and entertaining, but sometimes things are explained in a way people might have hard time to understand. Things could've been made and explained easier. Audio in some of the videos are of poor quality, not something you expect from a course that teaches you a language. I shall give a feedback in the course page itself once I have gone through all material. Overall, the course is worth taking. Good luck to everyone.",4
82587,Some slides are a bit childish.,4
82588,"I noticed, what I believed were errors, but there was no where to post comments - I couldn't find a Discussion Forum.Nor were the presenters still members of staff at the Uni.",4
82590,Great job. Thanks you all.,4
82600,i have fun with this course .,4
82606,I truly enjoyed this course!,4
82614,"Very good course but not as good as the first one :Try monads are never introduced but are referenced by one of the lecturer.Signal DP for mutable state encapsulation is introduced, but it's benefits are unclear until the research paper is read.Exercises are still very carefully designed. Thanks for the great contents !",4
82615,Last week passes by the subjects superficially,4
82618,A valuable extension of the ideas in the first course. Helped to continue to build confidence in using Scala and introduced,4
82620,"The introduction to functional reactive programming is well done. You go from the problem to the solution in a few lectures, and understand positive and negative aspects of the approach.",4
82621,High quality course,4
82622,The FRP part was too short. The earlier version were much longer and contained some introduction about RxScala.,4
82623,lectures do not correspond to the laboratory work,4
82627,"To me every mooc by Martin Odersky is pure gold. I guess this course underwent a couple of ""refactorings"" because I didn't have the impression that the topics (and sometimes the assignments) throughout the 4 weeks followed a clear path. This is just my impression though, I might be wrong. Anyway great mooc and lots of fun, I can totally recommend it!",4
82628,"Excellent course, has a good transition from the previous course but still manages to be standalone. The last week about reactive programming was a little hamfisted, though. I would have liked a more formal, but pragmatic, approach like Martin usually does.",4
82631,"Most Lectures are extremely helpful for standard learner of Scala who is unfamiliar with Stream, Rx and any other lazily evaluated expression and it's applicable architecture.But lectures about Future and it's related Class are not enough volume and quality.It is why I does not rate full stars.",4
82632,"The assignments seemed somewhat easy compared to curriculum which became more difficult. I would say that the assignments from the first course were more challenging then those from the second. I also think very little attention was paid to new monad constructs like Try, Validate and scala's reactive library, but I guess the later was left for the third course.",4
82633,Great course! Lacked the same polish as the previous course though. Week3 assignment had grading issues.,4
82639,"Great course, however, I needed more time than was suggested",4
82640,"Theory is great but recorded messy sometimes. I looks like it was recorded for something else and then adapted for this course. And I would like to have some more explanation not important topic like Monads, etcI also would like to have more practice on each of important topic to really fit it in your mind",4
82645,A very good course (4.5 in my eyes) the only thing for me that was lacking straight after previous course was a bigger difficulty between videos and programming excises. But maybe that's my lack of Scala experience.,4
82646,"Good assignments, lectures are a great introduction to Reactive programming but would be nice to have a ""where to go from here"" type of section/lecture.",4
82650,too easy,4
82652,"The course is good, but not as splendid as the first in the specialisation. The difficulty has apparently skyrocketed, while some videos from week 4 seems to be missing, making the lectures difficult to understand.",4
82653,"Course material quality is unequal throughout the lecture. It does seem that some parts were taken from another class and were copy-pasted into this class. Anyhow, very good class overall, the homeworks are really good and well prepared. Thanks for putting online such a great class !",4
82661,Overall learned a lot. Some contents are hard to follow but using supplementary material helped me to discover new things about scala.,4
82663,The first two weeks where very well structured and as interesting as the first course. In week 4 it seems that there have been materials from other courses puzzled together (Principles of Reactive Programming). That made it a bit difficult to keep on track.,4
82664,"Basics of lazy streams, monads with for notation, functional reactive programming, and futures with error recovery.",4
82666,exposure to libraries and advanced features of scala,4
82668,"Good course, material needs more coverage in programming assignments. For example monads and futures were not covered.",4
82669,I missed a bit of coherence in this course,4
82671,"Pretty informative course, even if the first one or two weeks used to the part of the Intro to Scala course. The 2nd part of the lectures in the 4th week seem really disconnected from the rest of the course and are introduced with very little context.",4
82674,"The course decsribes several ideas in functional way of thinking: Streams, Monads, Reactive Programming. By the way, looks like course is compiled from several pieces that are completely disconnected from each other.",4
82678,"Thanks for this course!Only one times i was very confused - when i saw that in the last assignment i should use Vars and Signals, not Features and Promises - that's, i think, a little bit far from as async code in real projects, which contain promises, features, actors etc.But anyway, thanks for all of that, it was useful for me.",4
82685,"Wonderful course, except for the hipster slides in the last week",4
82688,"FRP is interesting, but the Future seems lack of explanation and homework",4
82691,Nice course to learn how Scala is different from Java.,4
82695,"Overall very good and somehow challenging course, however week 4 is a bit convoluted (E. Meijer referring to the nonexisting (in this edition of the course) previous video etc.)",4
82696,"Less material and practical tasks than in the first Scala course, also some bits about Reactive programming were just taken from other course, but not fully, just partially!",4
82697,"This one is a bit overpriced, but interesting and useful.",4
82698,"Very interesting course. Four stars instead of five because it was less about ""Program Design"" (from the title) than I would have liked.",4
82699,This course was really great. It help to broaden my knowledge.,4
82700,"Apart from week 4, I found all classes very instructive and relevant. The video's from Erik Meijer in week 4 seemed a bit artificial. The exercise in week 3 was not really related to the classes other than that we learned in the course that there is a way to proove something and then we needed to. I could not really understand why or when I would apply that knowledge.",4
82701,Good. But the previous course was better.,4
82703,"A great continuation on Scala and functional programming, I wish the exercises were more challenging.",4
82706,"Great course, really enlightening",4
82707,Some of the lectures were tough to follow. Huge disconnect between the course videos and the assignments. QuickCheck assignment was a waste of time for me. Calculator assignment is really good. No assignments related to Week4 course work is disappointing.,4
82708,"The course is very good overall, except for the last week (Week 4), which includes videos from a completely different course and feels really like a mash-up of unrelated topics (they are not! it's just the presentation).",4
82709,Great course. seems like some things that were referred to during some of the lectures were missing and kinda left you waiting for more. Hoping they will be completed in future courses.,4
82710,Thought provoking exercises.,4
82717,"Very good and well-paced course. I'd give 5/5, but there are parts that seem to be missing -- lecturers refer to videos that aren't part of the course (or the previous one: Functional Programming Principles in Scala). Overall 4/5.",4
82719,Great course overall. It looked though as if some of the lectures were cut and pasted from some other course into the content and were not as coherent as they could be (particularly the case with the last week's material on FRP).,4
82727,"This course has been very good, and i will recommend it to anyone who wants to learn functional programming.",4
82741,"I would have loved to spend more time on FRP and Futures. Both of those sections could have been expanded and an assignment dealing with Futures would be very welcome. Also, the mish-mash of Futures-related lectures was a bit confusing (despite Erik Meijer's obvious enthusiasm for the subject). Otherwise the course is a great introduction to a number of interesting topics in Scala, which will probably serve as an important stepping-stone for the next parallel programming course.",4
82751,Good review of essential concepts. Lazyness and Signals ... and quickcheck!,4
82753,"Good course.Next step to get specialization in Scala and FP.Many thanks, Pavel",4
82761,Offers outstanding depth in parallel concepts and the weekly programming samples are really interesting and fun. Some good community discussion but not a lot of participation by instructors. The theoretical material is covered very quickly and there are not a lot of practice exercises to master those concepts.,4
82763,Thanks EPFL good course and has certainly broaden my awareness of the possibilities of using Scala.,4
82769,"The course is generally good, but it seems to be a bit of a hybrid of several different courses. Perhaps the videos should be updated so that references in the videos to ""the next several weeks"" in the last week of the course, don't confuse students.",4
82775,"Saw the application of some functional programming in the course. It was pretty cool, but it was a bit random. I wished we could learn more advance topics of functional programming, such as Category Theory.",4
82780,"A few last lectures (Future, Try) lack pretext, or at least appear somewhat out of order, unless one is familiar with the topic. Generally, higher score (10 out of 10, or 9 out of 10) could have been made a little harder to get. Adding a couple of extra optional problems for one point each could be a good idea.",4
82784,"This part I liked less than the first. Less substance, and I do not like somebody replacing Mr. Odersky as a lecturer",4
82787,"The course was nice but not structured very good, especially week 4. From time to time you have a feeling that this course is more like a compilation of lectures made for other courses with similar topic. Especially confusing are moments when during the lecture author references previous materials you expected to know from lectures you've never heard. That's strange.",4
82789,"A good introduction to design of more complex Scala programs in a functional manner.Left a few things to be desired some places, such as: less legacy from the previous ""reactive programming in scala"" course; a discussion of immutable options for functional reactive programming; and a demonstration of an implicits-based implementation of Functional Reactive Programming, as was mentioned.For the most part a great course though.",4
82797,"Mostly as good as the course ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"" I took couple of years ago. However, some of the videos are clearly taken from another courses and referencing to content not in this course. Especially the final week's content is very confusing, topics changing constantly without clear context and presentation. (I actually purposedly skipped the last few videos, as they seemed completely off the track and it was very hard to get anything out of them.)The exercices were good, starting where the previous course ended, and most of the videos were clear and well done (basically the videos by Martin).",4
82800,"The content is excellent (as always), however the form leaves a bit to be desired. The video quality kept reverting to ""low"", and even on ""high"", the resolution was nothing to be proud of in 2016 (or at any time during this century). Also, the instructors appeared to make references to lectures that are not a part of this edition of the course. But these are small issues – the course is definitely worth taking, small imperfections or not.",4
82803,A bit lost sometimes. The course was remodeled after previous ones obviously and it seems a little chaotic sometimes. Not sure to get all the message that was intended to be passed. Sometimes the exercice are way simpler than the session contents. Still I've enjoyed (almost) every moment of the course and I am eager to go on! Thanks!,4
82809,Classical in type and value,4
82811,"Maybe an unfair comparison but I am comparing this with the principles of reactive programming. That had much more contents such as actors, etc. Having said that this is a good course by itself.",4
82818,"Course material was not difficult, but the homeworks weren't much correlated with it. If you attend other IT online courses you will notice that this one is a little old fashioned. I was also more interested in real-life usages than how it should be implemented. Regardless the cons course was informative and somehow useful.",4
82820,"Very good course. Sad that it is at the same time as the Functional Programming Principles in Scala, which is clearly a pre-requisite.",4
82831,A well presented course introducing good background material regarding the physiology of human sound perception. It loses marks from me because of its seemingly obsessive fixation on the vocalization similarity hypothesis as the basis for aesthetic preference in music without a rigorous presentation of supporting evidence.,4
82832,"Very interesting, specially in evaluating how necessary the complexity in music is for composers.",4
82835,"The course was quite difficult for me. The questions in quizes are sometimes hard to answer. Very often there is no simple solution. Or maybe my command of English was not sufficient to complete the course without several mistakes. Otherwise, topics were covered deeply and were thought-provoking.",4
82838,"Quite an interesting course connecting various fields such as mathematics, physics, brain science, music and music theory. I am giving it 4 stars as I feel that some explanations are weak and need more elaboration.",4
82841,I enjoyed learning this class. I was interested in the scientific aspect of music.,4
82842,"This course was fairly interesting. The argument that the notes of our scale are linked to human vocalisation, not just in the West, but the whole world.",4
82843,The very dull voice of the teacher makes him sound as if he is bothered about teaching the course.interesting info otherwise.,4
82844,An interesting course about some biological aspects in music as well as some comparing examples between cultural styles.,4
82847,"Interesting and well presented. I completed the entire course, all lectures and assignments. However, week 1 is persistently listed as ""overdue"" even though it was actually completed ahead of time. Please remove from the ""overdue"" status which incessantly prompts me to join an upcoming new session. I enjoyed the course but this technical snafu is annoying.",4
82859,Very informative and interesting. However the quizzes didn't coincide well with the lectures.,4
82865,"Good video content, but quizzes need to be revised.",4
82867,"The content is great. But there's not a lot of activity on the discussion boards, and there are some technical issues with the quizzes (using future lesson material on current quizzes). But the content is really fascinating.",4
82871,This class provided a new perspective about my coworkers. Helping me to better understand their behavior. It also helped me evaluate my own strengths and weaknesses. A good team building exercise.,4
82883,Pretty ok. Prett interesting. Good theoretical background and strcuturing.,4
82889,"From the Systems Biology specialization courses, this is the one from where I have learned the most, in some way the reason is because I didn't know most of Network Analysis, but now I feel familiarized with it. I consider this is one of the most extended courses, and could be improved in the practice evaluation with more exercises.",4
82896,"This is a good introductory course to whom has never worked with or studied investing. Instructors are clear and didactical. In this review I will focus on three main points of improvement:1) Not deepening in Portfolio’s Risk formulas/calculations: lots were said about how correlation and (co)variance of individual assets can influence the whole portfolio’s risk. Though, It was not taught how to calculate the whole portfolio’s risk (ex.: how to do a variance-covariance matrix).2) Not applying what was taught in practical and holistic cases (considering multiple classes of assets and risk profile): I believe many of those who attended to this course want as output to conduct a Portfolio Optimization. Although we know all the concepts behind Modern Portfolio Theory’s and Diversification, none can apply it in an excel or to a given case. For that, I found a really interesting tutorial video from Dr. Colby Wright in YouTube that helped me on that. It was simple and would be a great conclusion if added to this course.3) Debating Modern Portfolio Theory’s theoretical limitations, but not leading to new theories or more applicable one’s to surpass its limitations.I do know this course is one of a series of other courses in a Specialization. Maybe some of those points of improvement is answered in another course. I hope instructors might consider the course design and review the points in order to improve attendant’s learning, event if we do not attend the whole specialization.",4
82897,This course was extremely hard but learning the concepts are worthwhile!,4
82899,"I really liked that there were multiple instructors. Their French accent was a bit hard to understand sometimes: 'asseta-location' vs 'asset allocation'.Good historic overview of how risk management evolved over time, and good ideas and solutions to manage risk.",4
82911,The course was good and further founded my knowledge of investing as an individual investor. It had helpful practical insights on which macroeconomic parameters to look out for in particualr and how computing the major finance parameters when it comes to the number crunshing.,4
82912,"at times , it is hard to catch up with the ideas conveyedbut overall , a very relevant and important subject taught in a very sensible and easy way.",4
82915,"Very interesting courses, with a good theory basis in portfolio manangement",4
82919,very good course. Thank you Coursera and my professors.,4
82927,Great course! Useful but a little boring...,4
82928,Thank you to all the professors and speakers for the knowledge,4
82936,"Gives a very good overview of risk tracking for Portfolios, and includes an introduction to derivative products.",4
82960,"Hi! I have just started the course and I find it fascinating. Last year I attended a similar course offered by the uni. of California so I am familiar with some elements of the course, yet, I now get a clearer view of the subject, it seems Latins were right:' repetitio est mater studiorum'. In addition, I practise apps on the PC which are not my cup of tea.I feel grateful for what Coursera and the relevant Universities offers us. I do believe such opportunities for expanding knowledge are more than just precious, they are what makes life meaningful , esp. at my age.Thank you.My greetings from Athens.",4
82964,A good intro for starters.,4
82967,"good tips, but needs to be more teorical",4
82975,"I really enjoyed learning about graphic design and I enjoyed Dave's approach and presentation of the ""best practices."" I think the visual examples used in this course really helped me to understand the material. I liked how he used the same basic material but showed different ways to compose it. Thanks for the course!",4
82978,Great course! very well organised. Easy to understand some important theories of graphic design. Many exercises in the course can let you practice the skills needed in graphic design.,4
82985,"Sometimes the correct answers were not provided, which made the assignments difficult to learn from.",4
83001,"In general this is a good introductory course. You should read the book if you want more in-depth knowledge in this field. I feel that some of the concepts can be expanded a little more, like local structure in Markov model. Overall, this is a great course.",4
83003,"Everything is explained very clearly throughout the course, and the structure they use to teach the subject , from basics to advanced material, is especially helpful. Would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in probabilistic modelling.",4
83016,The course is pretty good. I love the way that the professor led us into the graphical models.,4
83019,"Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course, which I greatly enjoyed. That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook. In this course there is a lot less video content, and the coding assignments are less interesting. Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed, and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB. If you're serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book. The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration, which makes them difficult to review, and unlike the case in the ML course, there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics.",4
83021,"Great material. Course mentors are nowhere to be found and some of the problems are hard, so I'd have liked to see some guidance.",4
83022,More feedback from TA would be appreciated,4
83025,Very good course. It should contain more practical examples to make the material better to understand.,4
83032,Instructor is engaging in her delivery. Topic is interesting but difficult.,4
83034,"Great course, however, the honors track assignments are a bit too tedious and take lots of time.",4
83035,"The course gives an good introduction of PGM. The highlights are the well-designed quizzes and assignments. But the videos of lectures are not good enough. It's too fast and some key concepts are not clearly explained.After looked into another course on coursera, I add a star for this....",4
83038,"This excellent course is exceptional in that very few MOOCs are taught at this graduate level. Others have pointed out that while this is an introductory course to Probability Graphical Models, I would say that this is still an advanced course, with lots of prerequisites. Prof. Koller is an excellent lecturer, yet moves fast, and you'll need to do reading to fill in the gaps. I haven't been able to find a good book to accompany the course, as her book is pretty dry. I strongly recommend one complete all of the Honors assignments to get a lot out of the course. The discussion boards are not so active with plenty of unanswered questions. Doing the programming assignments will greatly enhance your skills in debugging.",4
83041,Wonderful course with great material. Wish there were more examples in the material. Nonetheless cannot complain to get this course for free with SEE material and programming assignments (need to complete yet in this session),4
83044,"The course is great with plenty of knowledge. A little defect is about description about assignment. As the forum discussed, several quizzes may confusing.",4
83063,"Thanks to this course, Probabilistic Graphical Models are not anymore an esoteric subject! I am really looking for the second part of the course.",4
83068,Great and well paced content.Quizzes really helps nailing the tricky points.,4
83076,"The content is ample. The speaking pace is a little bit slow such that I chose to watch the videos at speed of 1.75x. It will be better if more examples can be presented especially for different processing approaches, algorithms or data structures.",4
83079,"I have one issue about week 4 ""Append"" tree. I did not get how Append correlates with binary digits. I would like to have some step by step example how will we create a tree like s1 = Single(1) appendLeaf Single(2), s2 = s1 appendLeaf Single(3), s3 = s2 appendLeaf Single(4), s4 = s4 appendLeaf Single(5) using binary digits?",4
83083,The course is good but is not focused on scala features. It is more generic parallel programming approach.,4
83086,"Its a very good course! perhaps the in the practice code, before jumping into the problems they can provide a couple of simple examples/questions such that the main ideas are learnt.",4
83088,Great course!,4
83098,Nice course! I learned a lot...,4
83099,"What a difficult course it is!Nevertheless, it was very helpful.",4
83100,learned a lot,4
83104,"Would be good to introduce more about Scala native solutions like Futures, parallel data structures and best ways of using them on practice, cases and best practices how to work with shared data, avoid deadlocks, how to work best when you have to process large data or when you have massive calculations.",4
83105,"Very well delivered course, more examples are needed though.",4
83106,Very good course overall on the basics of parallel programming in scala. Would have been nice to talk a bit more on the low level setup (parallel and task construct code).,4
83110,Good course but scala understanding is required for this course. So please register for prior course in the certification task to easily complete this course.,4
83111,Thanks!,4
83115,"Some problems with downloads and to view videos on the mobile app (Android), with some videos recorded with a low volume.Despite that interesting and I think would need more time to get deeper in the concepts showed.",4
83117,"It requires more effort on undestanding the algorithms involved in the problems, rather than paralelism and its techniques. Instead of 4 weeks it would benefit of an additional week - for those who take the course after the regular work hours at their job. So 5 weeks would be more adequate.",4
83119,"There are some really boring parts, like 10 first minutes of many videolectures. It's kinda difficult to watch list.map explained in detail, since it's a course supposed to be taken after the one on basic Scala.Overall - it's really good, I learned a lot.",4
83122,"Great explanations and insights around parallel programming. The instructors help you understand how parallel programming works and are doing great in making the complex topic understandable. To improve it further, there could be more explanations on performance differences between alternative solutions as well as some guidance on how to apply these ideas in practical Scala programming.",4
83123,"Very interesting course, I would recommend. I always wanted to learn about Scala parallel collections.",4
83124,"The course is pretty hard, even for someone like me, who has been working in parallel computing for years. The reason is the structure of the course and the presentation of the material. The topics are somewhat chaotic and in many cases it is hard to tell whether a certain operator comes from the Scala standard library or is just an abstraction.All in all, finishing the course is a rewarding experience. But beware, there is a significant gap between the foundation courses taught by Martin Odersky and this one.",4
83125,"Most of the concepts and explanations were good but the assignments could be better organized. I wasn't sure what I was doing for a while, and the test cases don't cover the code in a way that progresses naturally. Some parts of it can't be tested until most of the code is written, and then major portions of the code isn't even tested until it's submitted. It would be great if the tests progressed along with the code and people didn't have to guess at the correct solution but just knew it was right when they got it.",4
83127,"The course was ok, but at times too much theoretical when it comes to proofs of some methods are working as expected. I think its good to know the principles of parallelizing application and changing the potential algorithms, but this has applicability only in specific fields like comlex computations that need to be highly parallelized and less likely you would use these principles in standard backend development",4
83128,"good overall, but sometimes overly complicated",4
83129,Awesome course to learn parallel programming and advantage of scala to achieve this.Learned how to think algorithms in parallel being careful that it's not always better to do everything in parallel.The only thing I didn't like that much is that the course has too many mathematical explanations and maybe that lectures should be optional for those that want to go further.,4
83132,"Insightful, though I am not sure if in non R&D/Academia settings the knowledge here can easily be applied.",4
83133,"Not as good as the first two courses from the specialization, but still good",4
83135,"This course had a lot of depth to it, both in the lectures and the programming assignments. The last assignment seemed needlessly complex with not enough focus on the parallel programming aspect. I wish there had been more of a focus on how to actually write the parallel and task constructs which were instead given already implemented without much explanation.",4
83138,"Assignments are focused on problem-solving rather than the importance of parallelism, missing the point of the lecture. It is a Scala course, so it is always fun!",4
83140,"Appreciate the time spent by the authors to prepare all the course materials and the assignments. Everything clear and relatively self-contained. However, I still do not feel to be an expert in parallelism.",4
83143,Presentations were presented well and the assignments were interestingly varied but quite challenging for the newbie.,4
83144,"I feel the concepts which are necessary to use in programming assignments are not discussed in the lectures enough. As result figuring out what the assignment steps are all about takes too much time. Some tasks are absolutely trivial, and others are simply too difficult.",4
83145,"Some missed explanations in the first week (mergedSort implementation)Tha last two videos are quite difficult to understand. The ConcBuffer structure seems to be poweful, but the explanation and examples are tight.In this course, the weekly tasks are explained very well. Thank you very much!",4
83146,"Really a great course but with a heavy work for the duration. If others courses are followed in parallel, there's no time to loose",4
83148,"Good explanations, relevant assignments.But too small, too little graded assignments as for subject. Be better if the assignments has less starter code.",4
83149,"good in general, theory part on complexity is too tedious",4
83152,"The course was well covered and very informative. As someone with zero experience in parallelism, I felt I could've absorbed a lot more if the topics were not completely new to me.As mentioned in other reviews, the last assignment, Barnes Hut Simulation, was very time consuming and I found myself spending more time trying to understand the problem rather than implementing it. That was very challenging for someone with low academic background.",4
83155,"I learned very useful programming techniques, but I'm a bit lost as to whether these techniques are ""good practices"" or if they are ""existing parallel programming features in Java, transposed as-is in Scala""",4
83156,"The course achieves its objectives, but the assignments require too much effort for solving general problems, and relatively little for parallelism-related tasks. In other words, understanding what the problem is takes far more time than solving it. The Lego-assisted teaching is a definite plus though!",4
83164,The course was really good. Got to learn so much about parallel programming with that course. The explanation level is very basic and any Computer Science related person can easily grasp the concepts,4
83177,Good course. The assignments should focus on the parallel programming itself instead of language stuff.,4
83180,Assignments weren't challenging.,4
83181,"Very good. Only things I wish were better is more comments in some assignments and more prepared tests. Also I miss not having ""Statement of Accomplishment"" like some other Scala courses :-(.",4
83186,On the plus side:The material is presented in concise and efficient manner. It required little knowledge of Scala and JVM. It kept hidden the underlying implementation of parallelism and task utilities.On the minus side:The homeworks were easy. I could fill in the gaps almost automatically and I don't feel like I know the matter.,4
83201,I was able to complete 80% of the course in the first go. I found the presentation both interesting and current and will highly recommend for others who plan to learn or visit India.,4
83202,I am sorry. I forgot to submit a review when I took the course. I am a British national and the course was clearly aimed more at Americans but I enjoyed it and felt I learned a great deal. Well done to the presenter and all who helped him put the course together.,4
83206,Very informative,4
83211,outstanding blend of the content....,4
83214,"Interesting course but it is one-sided and focuses on advantages and strengths. For academic honesty there should also be a course: ""The horrors of India"" to balance this one.",4
83219,"This was an interesting course that covered many subjects on the surface but with an emphasis on key parameters that have to be monitored and focused on to improve performance. However, I was hoping more from the last part on solving conflict. A few real examples of conflict with a brief analysis on their causes and possible solutions could have helped us (the students) to develop strategies of our own. Instead the last part is more like a study of the different types of conflicts and general methods.",4
83225,It is a good refresher course for practitioners and should be really helpful for beginners,4
83227,Good overview for someone new to people management.,4
83239,"A well delivered, concise yet adequately comprehensive introduction to policy production.",4
83240,"A good solid course which will improve the way you analyse problems and write advice about it. It does take more time than the announcement says. It took me about 4x8 hours, but it depends on how serious you take it of course.",4
83242,"Well constructed course that should lead the learner towards developing a policy position that will be characterized by rigor and coherence. Professor Griffiths is the star of this course, with a particular teaching style that conveys often complex ideas in a clear and forth-right manner. Highly recommended!",4
83248,The Medical Device Module is a bit too short and does not cover enough information in my opinion.,4
83251,"This is a very good course for Pharmaceutical and Medical devices. However, the course was not stand-alone; I had to take google occasionaly. Thanks for the course.GreetingsMubashar Rehman",4
83253,"Overall, a good an edifying course; I feel as though I learned a number of things about pharma and the medical device industry through taking it. The only thing that detracts from my rating is the clarity of the lectures: Bryana Mayer's lectures were a bit dense and confusing (particularly the first few), and she often read directly from the slides. For some of the lectures, it was not clear as to why that particular information was being covered. Despite this, I was able to gather useful information; it just wasn't always completely clear or easy.",4
83254,Good in general. a little boring and not really have competitor analysis. They had the worse lectures about the competitor analysis for medical device lectures!,4
83256,Clear with good real examples!,4
83260,GOOD COURSE!,4
83261,Is a good method to study the concepts of Project management.,4
83262,MUY BUEN CURSO PARA LOS BASICOS COMO YO,4
83267,Very compelling and easy to follow (this coming from a Liberal Arts major).,4
83270,"Very interesting subject matter, presented very well",4
83274,nicely covers the content for even a new learner its a good source of knowledge. i am impressed by the course content and teacher,4
83278,Professor Daniel Chamovitz was wonderful and very interesting. But it was difficult for me as I have very little preliminary information on plants and biology,4
83279,Very interesting course and enthusiastic professor,4
83289,very unique method of teaching,4
83291,Very informative--IMPOSSIBLY HARD FINAL EXAM though.,4
83302,It's boring but a necessary step to mastering Python.,4
83303,Very basic introduction to data structures in Python,4
83307,I like it very much! It's very practical and easy to understand!,4
83315,"It was an awesome course with a lot of new concepts to learn. I feel, the chapters on Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples should have at least 5-6 graded assignments each, to make these concepts more clear through extensive programming assignments.",4
83319,"Good overview. The overall set of Python courses starts to take pace here. I found that reading the PDF versions of the lectures and then focusing on the quizzes and assignments was the most efficient way to work through this. Somebody with programming background will find this easy, but it has enough meat to make it a good intro to the language. Well done!",4
83334,An excellent and pragmatic approach to learning the fundamental facets of python data analysis,4
83345,"Thank you ! Great course, just the right pace (very important)Only (very (very)) small suggestion : stress on the links between list, dictionary and tuple ! How can you get from one to the other, especially with .item() it was by far the most difficult part so far:)",4
83349,"Well paced, well explained. A bit of issues with the grader tbh; it appeared I had proper syntax but was getting errors.",4
83353,"Python Data Structures is a good course and well thought out. There are plenty of resources to help the student, my only recommendation would be that the assignments moreso force the students to use the relevant concepts rather than allowing work arounds. I occasionally felt the homework could have been structured to more step by step steer me to use concepts from the most recent lesson.",4
83354,Very useful contents for data structure analysis using Python,4
83384,It was a good experience for me. I think instructor is very good at teaching.,4
83387,a good walkthrough about Fundamentals of Python Programming!,4
83388,This was a really good and interesting course. Can be taken to a bit higher level though to make it even more fun.,4
83415,Great class,4
83432,"Dr. Chuck's explanations are clear and all the lessons are easy to follow: focus on relevant web technologies, perfect pace, examples based on popular APIs. As someone with some basic knowledge in programming already I was expecting the assignments to be more challenging. As clearly announced on the website this course is targeted at beginners who took the previous courses from the same teacher: all exercises can be solved in about 10-15 lines of code and the solutions can be directly applied from the videos without much further thinking. The rest of you will, like me, breeze through it in no time. Kudos for the interesting interview videos proposed as bonus material!",4
83435,Great course. Not enough assignments though.,4
83443,Great course. Some small errors can add time to understanding. It's getting old (Python 2 vs. today's Python 3).,4
83490,Great course. Could do with going over things a bit more deeply at times. There is a lot to take in for one course but still very good. I enjoyed it immensely.,4
83503,"Great, enjoyed it.",4
83505,"This course creates a solid bridge between the basics you learned and the advanced concepts you're going to learn in Python. Even if you have prior python experience, this course will be good refresher of your knowledge on Python. Thanks Dr.Chuck and Coursera.",4
83542,excellent course. I learned a lot and lectures are wonderful,4
83543,really helpful,4
83551,This is excellent course on basic data structure. I will encourage you to take this course.,4
83570,great course for basics,4
83581,Pretty basic intro to python,4
83583,Good course...,4
83586,Hoped for more exercises.,4
83588,files is to weak!,4
83590,Very good course with good assignment questions.,4
83592,"Often on Quora, I'm answering questions like https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-to-start-with-for-a-beginner/answer/Ron-Barak-1. I've upgraded my answer to point to this course. - as a good introductory course for Python beginners.I rated the course only 4/5, as I'd like to have (maybe optional) quizzes/assignments which are a bit more demanding, so that even a non-beginner would feel challenged.",4
83601,"I think the course was phenomenal, challenging and great way to learn Python-Data structures.Thank you Dr. Chuck for teaching this course and making it available for us to learn.",4
83612,Simple and clear. Quite satisfied with the fact that I finally understood the difference between tuples and lists.Could have been interesting to have sets in the course as well!,4
83622,"a very good course, the instructor is funny and very straight forward.the only thing that need to be improved is the assignments, they need to be more challenging ^_^",4
83627,Great,4
83636,Sometimes the course doesn't show the complicated example of the assignment. I cannot work them out sometimes.,4
83639,Relatively simple. Again I enjoyed the bonus interviews: They were very helpful and inspiring,4
83642,It was great experience learning with sir chuck.I am going apply my learning from this course to my education,4
83647,"All the course is good, the online playground may need to be upgraded so that we can see the invisible tab and space to code efficiently.",4
83651,"Good Course, with interesting lectures and",4
83655,Best of the bes,4
83658,nice course to get kick start for working in python,4
83690,Nicely explained. But tougher assignments,4
83693,Thanks a lot.The Coursera is greatest.,4
83696,Great Course,4
83700,Enjoyed learning Python from Chuck,4
83731,An excellent course to kickoff learning Python.,4
83736,Good course,4
83737,"Course material and problems were great, it would be more beneficial for students if there would be more different types assignments",4
83745,"Very good course, but there are some places not too deep.",4
83754,Good course. Occasionally frustrating trying to learn to do the assignments without all of necessary support but if you are dedicated you will get through and learn the material too. Course overall is a very manageable pace even if you have no experience like me.,4
83760,Good for starters. Instructor is very good.,4
83768,Auto grade could be better.,4
83771,Thank you Professor!!,4
83775,"This continues Dr. Chuck's easing into Python. It's a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource. The existence of the book is noted in the videos but it isn't really stressed, which is unfortunate as it's helpful. About the only thing I'd appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity.",4
83779,I think this course is better than the first one. It's not as slow or as 'baby sitting.' it's very clear and easy to understand. And it sure is playful! :),4
83782,"It's fun so and it's easy. I really love the way that Dr.Chuck teach the lessons, especially the magic part , lol. Hence, I highly recommended this course to people who never contact to coding. However, it's too easy to students who have learnt C++ /Java, but still, it's an excellent course.",4
83784,"Great course! I started learning Python for the first time, and It is also basically my first programming language experience. The videos, explanations and examples are very good, well structured and easy to understand. However I miss more practical exercises and more worked videos with the solutions specially after the week 5 when the subject gets a bit more complicated. Perhaps the solutions should be locked/unlocked after students submit their solutions ?! I don't know if that is possible but that would be great, specially for students who wants to continue with this specialization. Also for the record, I am a mom of a 5 year old that is only part time in the kindergarten, and I was able to successfully complete the course. I hope that can be used as a motivation for all students out there, independent of your age or your background, you can learn how to program! :D",4
83786,"Dear Lecturer,The only complaint is that I find this course pretty short, but everything is well made, and prepared.",4
83812,A good courser specialization for starter!,4
83817,It is an excellent course but it would be nice if he talk about complexity of these data structures. Over all this course is nice for complete beginner in the word of programming,4
83833,"A little trickier than the first course and in some cases the explanations weren't as intuitive as in the first course, but overall, this is a great course for Python beginners with no computer science background. I love Dr. Chuck's teaching style; he makes it easy to ""get.""",4
83835,"As for me, I would like to have at least two mandatory assignments in each section. It will provide more practical experience in processing of the material! Thank you!!!",4
83850,basics,4
83851,Fun introductory course,4
83856,very good online learning experience,4
83861,"Pretty decent class. Especially for those who is just beginning to learn Python. The only issue I had with this course is the on-line python compiler, which sometimes would erroneously interprets spacing and would randomly throw errors. Retyping and recompiling your code would solve the problem, but this is very annoying.",4
83867,"This class offers great information, but the lectures could be more efficient.",4
83873,"Very helpful. I know other proramming languages, and this was key to using Python in a meaningful way.",4
83893,"this is a reaally good course, you can increase your python playground and knowledge using what you have learnt in Course 1 but you can also deal with more difficult types, functions, probems etc.I think that the most useful aim is to connect new arguments (like new types) with what you have already learnt trying to find a solution for more difficult problems",4
83916,Easy intro to basic structures in python. Some exposure on advanced structures such as Counters would be useful too,4
83950,Great course!,4
83953,Good structure of this course. I did this course and was reading Python for informatics book together. Gave me good platform to start doing more advance things to do in Python.,4
83956,Thank you! learnt a lot!!,4
83957,very good course,4
83969,"Excellent, am becoming a more confident programmerLoved this course",4
83970,The course is very ez for me to pick up the python programming.,4
83975,"Great course, esp. for beginners; however I'd recommend mentioning a few more details of data structures.",4
83978,"The course is excellent. The platform has some aspects not so good - some parts still don't show up as 'done', so the progress line is always wrong. Also, the platform is not structured for a course consisting of a number of courses in series, leaving the dates etc wrong. Chapter 1 and 2 should ideally show up as completed, as theey are repeated in every module (which is fine, but the platform should take care of those members who have done these in a previous module?",4
83980,great for beginners or people with no programming knowledge.,4
83986,Dr. Chuck is great as usual.And some probles with autograder service.,4
83994,When Charles Severance is by your side. You cannot help but learn what he is teaching. Pitch-Perfect explanations.,4
84001,Hour films are far too long for such essential information,4
84004,Great course. Excellent teacher.,4
84012,Good introductory course,4
84014,"This course is a very soft and gentle introduction to python data structures , really designed to real dummies. I liked it!",4
84020,"Good one to go thru, best in class.",4
84048,"Very good source for learning lists, dictionaries and tuples in python",4
84058,"Few times, Explanations on Assignments were necessary.",4
84061,Great course for the beginner & intermediate level. Very structured & interactive. The mentors at discussion forums are very helpful.,4
84090,"Thank you for the interesting course!One thing that this course lacks, in my opinion, is the division of the lecture material in smaller parts. It is easier to proceed, when the videos are about 7-10 minutes long, than 20-30. You can always stop in between those parts without the need to remember the last minute of the video you watched and also to feel closure, since the part has been checked as completed.Thanks again! I wish your course improves and stays successful!",4
84104,Just for new,4
84123,Nice and Easy class to hone your Python skills!,4
84125,"Awesome course!this course enables you master python basic structures including string,list,dict,tuple and read quickly.Also,you will learn how to communicate with text files.",4
84133,I think professor is so cute（≧∇≦）,4
84134,This course really helped me to grab overviews of the Python. Thanks!,4
84138,This class is tough and time flies. No more intro stuff. This is is where we really start to get into some heavy programming (at least for my endurance level),4
84147,very well taught of the concepts broken down as chapters and put together to understand and think the logic behind programming.,4
84148,good course. the shell wasn't working properly at all,4
84149,greatly simplified and practical course.Thankyou Dr.Chuck,4
84159,"The teacher is motivating and keeps the learning funny, the extra video are cool and give you a broad view of how big the IT world is. The assignments are challenging and instructive. As a beginner I really enjoyed the course.",4
84162,Easy to understand.,4
84163,Easy way to learn python,4
84187,Very nice explanation. The course could have had more assignments and data structures in depth.,4
84205,too easy,4
84207,loved the course. Need more assignments :),4
84212,I hope there would be more practice,4
84213,I really liked the course. I just wish it was more practice heavy and the lectures were broken up more and there were quizzes during the lectures to keep you engaged more and make it more interactive.,4
84221,very good introductory course,4
84228,Good for beginners. Would be nice if there were more assignments.,4
84229,"I enjoyed taking this course very much. The classes were well thought-out and laid a good foundation for understanding Python Data structures. While prior experience is helpful, I think the lectures were clear enough for even someone new to Python to grasp. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to build on the basic knowledge of Python.",4
84233,suitable for newbie,4
84244,"It is good.But the videos are too long....maybe they can be split into parts,which would make them easier to complete",4
84271,Great class.Would be nice if we had more assignments. I'm really excited about starting the next course!,4
84274,"The Professor is excellent and very student-friendly, and the course material is very clear.Two issues though:1) List comprehensions should be introduced. They are extremely powerful and should really be introduced at this stage.2) Charging $79 for this course seems like poor value for money, specially for a student like me. It doesn't go into great detail and the price point for what is a 5-6 hour course with simple exercises seems too high.",4
84290,maybe could be more in depth. I really appreciated how passionate Dr Chuck is and how much he cares about his students even in online lectures. Thank you!!,4
84310,"Very good course. Dr. Charles, is a good instructor.",4
84318,the exercise are to easy,4
84323,Very good BASIC course to get familiar with python data structures.Teaching slides and video clear and pleasant.,4
84335,Good course for beginners,4
84343,This course was pretty astonishing. I had no idea that taking a class could be enjoyable and something I looked forward to. I definitely think that you should take this course.,4
84344,great course,4
84346,Things are really starting to get interesting. Videos are generally very helpful. I had a tough time with the lecture on tuples. That one may require some fine tuning (or maybe I require some).,4
84351,"Simple, Fast way you experience python",4
84364,Very helpful course,4
84373,More useful than part 1 which was too basic for me; and started actually learning new things toward the end,4
84374,The syllabus is too easy for a beginner also.Make it slightly challenging.,4
84398,Clear and useful,4
84404,"If more practice, better",4
84415,good course for beginners,4
84417,continues to be a very solid class,4
84433,"Could have been a bit more challenging, but great course none",4
84461,Interesting and Interactive,4
84479,"great content, but a little short... would love to meed Dr. Chuck in person ! =)",4
84483,Terrific overview of the fundamentals,4
84491,Excellent course. I would prefere to have more excercises in order to fix the concepts and terms in my mind.,4
84495,Great course and professor!,4
84497,"Good and fund. Some new concept such as list, dictionary, etc, may be better explained for ones not very familiar with these.",4
84505,Grate course... Thanks!,4
84507,"It could review the use of tuples/lists on variables like the settings variables on Django. Also, it could review more complex operations over the mentioned structures, like the list insert() method.",4
84509,"Great lectures, but too easy tasks",4
84511,Very exxplicit and cool learnings.,4
84518,"The lectures were good and to the point. I learned all the basics and the differences between data structures. The quizzes were quite good, with some nice traps set in them. The programming assignments supported the lectures well, though I felt there could've been more of them (perhaps just as ungraded bonus problems).",4
84532,I'd like assignments to be more complicated and I'd like more assignments,4
84540,"It is a good introduction for new beginners, interesting and funny. However, not recommended to someone with bases",4
84587,This course felt much more structured than the first course in the specialization (which is only appropriate given the course title). Dr Chuck is as personable as ever but the slightly longer lectures allow a bit more development.The only slight area for improvement might be in having some more challenging assignments--if you follow the lectures carefully and work though the examples that are shown the assignments are fairly straightforward.,4
84609,Very good course. I wish there were more problems to work.,4
84610,"Good course, fun to learn. If you know programming and just want to know how to use python, you can complete this course in a day.",4
84628,wonderful course :),4
84651,A fantastic course for python,4
84653,I enjoy how Charles has broken up the Python lectures in to bite sized pieces. It makes learning a lot easier to schedule. I've even taken other Python courses at the same time to taylor my educational needs.,4
84670,"Good content with a nice bit of character and playfulness from the professor. Be prepared to find your own ways to practice and solidify the skill, though.",4
84674,basic course for beginner,4
84675,"Again like in Getting Started with Python course, I wish there was a way for us to get explanations for quiz questions after we complete a quiz, so we can fully understand them. I wish we could have something similar for when we complete the coding assignments, the worked exercises are helpful, but it would be helpful after we complete an assignment to have a code to compare ours to, to see the differences and to make sure we understand exactly what Dr. Chuck was getting at. There were several assignments that I completed, but not in the correct way, so the next weeks assignment was more difficult than it should have been.",4
84679,"Simple, concise and easy to understand.",4
84680,All these courses really need to be updated to Python 3. There is no advantage in sticking to Python 2 anymore with Python4 on the horizon,4
84691,"Really good course, I wish we could have more practical exercise but It is a really great way of learning!",4
84698,"Good explaining on data structures, however shallow for people who already have good programming skills.",4
84720,Thank you!,4
84723,Great course!,4
84747,Really great course.....but expect problem sets to be little more difficult.,4
84752,"It became difficult to follow near the end despite watching all the videos and student curated notes. I feel like I need more guidance during the actual assignments. I do something wrong but am not sure where to reference to fix my code despite using internet resources. It would be nice if there were ""hints"" along the way for ways to fix the code.",4
84754,for beginners is wary good :),4
84755,Good introduction to the material.,4
84762,"Good entry-level course, i used it to refresh some basic python knowledge for 3rd course",4
84770,a great course,4
84774,Very informative class. Some of the hard topics in the last 2 chapters are not explained in a way that matched with the code terminology but good examples were given to help figure it out further.,4
84778,"Thorough explanation, good pace for people that need time to take in the information.",4
84788,"This was a great course, and Dr. Chuck's dedication to teaching Python is amazing. I went through the ""Programming for Everybody (Python)"" course and as stated in the description, this course is equivalent to the second half of the first course. I missed that detail and would have otherwise just skipped right to the third course (Using Python to Access Web Data."" Otherwise, it's a great course.",4
84812,2nd course I take and I enjoyed it just as much as the first!,4
84813,good explanation.,4
84821,A little bit repetitive for obvious things.,4
84827,"I have gotten what I needed from these classes. They where intended for someone with less programming background than myself so I occasionally found them tedious. That is on me, well done.",4
84829,excellent videos and challenging assignments to get thorough with the topics,4
84834,The assignments could be made a little more harder as the basics course (previous one) was already completed before taki,4
84838,Exercise were good.,4
84839,too few programming assignments :-(,4
84849,I know Python but wanted to refresh and brush up my basics. I have not gone through the video lectures and doing the exercises directly. I found the exercises very well built. Good for learning the basics.,4
84852,"Very good, everything nicely explained and a humoristic teacher.",4
84881,"More coding exercises, as optional for example, would be nice. Otherwise good course and guide videos.",4
84893,"Overall satisfied with the course, moreover at the end of every chapter. There are extra videos about jquery, json, That was awesome. I learned something new in this course.",4
84894,Nice and small lectures which helps me to learn efficiently. Thank you Professor,4
84895,I wish the programming assignments were a little tougher.,4
84901,easy but useful!,4
84919,"This was a good course, the lecturer is excellent.My only complaint was that the quizzes and assignments were not challenging enough. There should be some more difficult assignments and problems included in this course.",4
84921,Too easy,4
84980,"Dr. Chuck is very very good at what he is doing ,he has humor and helped a lot to understand all things about this course!Thank you very much.",4
84989,This course give basic data structures that all new Python programmer need.From this course you will learn and try yourself about useful data structure that usually use later.,4
84999,Course is good for begineers who want to learn programming.,4
85001,excellent teaching .. very simplifie,4
85004,"No doubt that this is a very helpful course for a beginner to learn Python. I would love to solve more assignments. Even if all the assignments are not graded, its fine but just for sake of practice let students like me solve more of them.Dr. Chuck explains all the topics very nicely. I would request him to go a little deep in topics. By way of example, it would have been great if he taught us the mechanism in which data is stored in Dectionaries (Hashing).",4
85007,An excellent course which will bring in a sense of confidence (to program in python) for all who diligently complete it.,4
85012,"Nice and easy to follow primer in Python data structures. You won't be learning any advanced programming techniques, but basic programming patterns applied to Python pass the revue.",4
85015,Good course for beginners. Not enough depth for people who want to master python and do some real projects with it.,4
85022,"Very good course. The last week's lesson on Tuples seemed pretty straightforward, but the last assignment seemed to require ""stretching"" a bit beyond the material outlined in the videos. I eventually got the answer, but felt a little bewildered and surprised at first as all previous weeks had lecture material and reading that made it rather easy to complete the assignments! I suspect subsequent courses in this specialization will be harder! Overall, this was a great course though",4
85027,"Thank you for opportunity, bu tcan you publish course for Python Advanced?",4
85033,"I am satisfied with this course, learned a lot, thanks!",4
85038,have some knowledge about python now,4
85041,Thank you Dr. Chuck!,4
85047,"It's kinda easy course. It's good for beginner. I would recommend this course because the prof give lectures interesting and logical, so that I can follow up the class at ease.",4
85052,"Nice course with comprehensive lectures, maybe a bit too easy but I learned a few things, so thank you very much!",4
85063,"challenging, but I learned a lot.",4
85066,"Great way of learning how Python works as well as what you can do with Python, and it's all relevantI really enjoy the tutoring style and the bonus interviews are really informative",4
85067,The exercises were interesting and seems more real-world rather than the exercises you may find on some textbooks!,4
85096,simple and effective way of teaching,4
85097,"Needs update, but it's very explained.",4
85098,"Awesome course, maybe I'm not giving myself enough time to digest one topic before jumping to another as I needed to refer past topic often, open sourced pdf version of book helped a lot.I wanted to know if it is possible to generated dictionary from two seperate list, and it is possible! I was able to zip two list to form a list of tuple and then used dict() method to form a dict... Might not be important but I felt the course will come a full roung when these are covered.",4
85116,It's completely straightforward to learn and understand. Thanks for your enthusiasm.,4
85134,"Just like the first one, really nice layout of the course and good explanations throughout the course book.",4
85145,Perhaps assignments were a little to straightforward - I would have enjoyed a more challenging final one.Very well presented and paced,4
85152,"Professor is nice, and the teaching is we",4
85188,Good paceand good practical examples.,4
85194,"Kind of easy. Was expecting more in-depth introduction on the underlying mechanisms of each data type, why and when should we choose one data type to use over the other, and more analysis on the efficiency of using specific data types.",4
85199,"pinpoints main python challenges about data parsing, and provides clever practice exercises (I understand now why and when using a tuple, dict or list).Good mindset...",4
85200,This course covers python data structure very efficiently. The course mainly focuses on most commonly used features. Examples used in lectures as well as the exercises are very practical.,4
85206,"Nice one, for complete beginners.But the assignments age just too easy, I think.",4
85219,"I enjoyed this course and learned new concepts and methodologies that I currently use on a regular basis in my work to automate repetitive tasks.I would have liked to work towards a bigger project, instead of simple weekly assignments, but still a great course that I recommend.",4
85220,"Informative, but overall very short. Wish there was a couple more chapters",4
85230,Excellent course to understand the basic data structures that exist in Python language.,4
85237,very good material.,4
85253,Thank You Dr. Chuck for a great course for a good foundation on data structures in Python!,4
85254,I'am disappointed because the assignments are too much easy,4
85268,"very cool professor, neat and clear instructions and exercises. might have been better with more detailed assignments even a final project.",4
85278,A little bit better comparing to the previous one,4
85281,I think this course is very concise and fundamental. Very good for beginners!,4
85287,The Grader Doesn't have test cases .Anyone can fool the grader easily,4
85290,"Lot to learn about Plato, same with the other course I'm taking On Plato which was great. I wish the instructor, no offense, taught more and told jokes less. I get what he was trying to do I think, but it made it seem like the vids were for starters and then you had hard tests that he didn't prepare you for in the videos. Much easier that I had already read much of Plato and then could read the excerpts for the test or I would have had a real difficult time getting through this course. It was difficult because you had to do a lot of the reading and sometimes it wasn't clear what answers where expected from the reading, perhaps my reading comprehension isn't as good as it should be. It was still a good challenging course though. I could respectfully disagree with how the material was presented though. Hopefully I can find time to join forums and get more out of it as I've finished the class before the class has officially started.",4
85294,"I was blown away by Professor Holbo's content, use of the Coursera tools, and the fusion of Plato' s and more modern thinkers' philosophies. For the course itself, I would give more than five stars if it could. I gave 4 stars because it was very difficult to engage in a substantial discussion concerning the concepts.I hope to have the opportunity to take other courses created by Professor Holbo in the future.",4
85298,"John Holbo is a very good narrator, I liked his book and videos very much. He made it more easy to get through the material, which sometimes is challenging (especially if english is not your native tongue)",4
85313,"Very good and informative lectures, but the quizzes were not well designed.",4
85315,"This course has many useful insights for anyone who is inclined to learn and appreciate the link between the law and economics. The lectures are long (often 30min) in duration consisting of mostly audio and mostly text displayed on screen. The screenspace could be better utilized by animations and slides. There is also a lot of material that goes on in the lectures which could have been better incorporated as a mandatory reading (Coase theorem, Supreme Court judgments etc.) followed up by discussion and quizzes.",4
85318,"Nice, but the speed the pro talks could be a little bit faster...",4
85319,"This is a great course that has already shown a great deal of utility. I went from this course to Environmental Law & Policy. Right off the bat we are talking about air pollution and property rights and externalities and Coase Theory, etc. So there we are. This was just a random choice of classes and one led right into the other. As I said, a great course and one that I will be able to continue to utilize into the future. Thanks!",4
85323,It was a good course - my only issue is that the quiz material is out of order.,4
85324,"Good course for beginners who wants to learn property and liability. I wish there could be more exercise between the videos to help us review what we've learned so we can understand better.There could be also a discussion section-like a forum-where people can discuss their misunderstanding. Otherwise this course is great,I learned a lot!",4
85326,Learned a lot about something i knew nothing about,4
85331,"The course was very interesting, our prof was inspiring. The tests were confusing though, the questions were in a fuzzy order and it was difficult for me to understand their line of thought.",4
85332,"Great course, great content. Thank you very much.",4
85333,This is an excellent course however I wish the answer sheets of the quiz be shared once the deadline has passed.,4
85334,"The Course is well planned and intended to give clarity with regard to the basics of interplay between law and economics. The best part is that anyone taking the course wouldn't feel like taking classes but, listening to a interesting story, in the process we learn key concepts. Prof Richard Adelstein has a delivery style which is simple that it seems like he is making a 8 year old understand it. So any one above eight years can take the class. The class lays down the foundation to our understanding of law and economics.",4
85337,Just Fantastic!!!,4
85344,"The instruction was nicely done. The quizzes were a little much. Designed by GTAs, maybe.",4
85376,"The constructs of learning functional programming are very useful and well explained. This course is about theory with practice problems which are somewhat challenging using SML as the programming language. The only downside of the course is the use of SML, which is fine for educational purposes, but lacks any real development / debugging frameworks and has no commercial usability beyond learning the concepts in the course.",4
85387,The peer review was too time consuming. Otherwise great course,4
85424,"Great course overall. It focuses on functional programming concepts like immutability, locally-defined functions, pattern-matching and forces the user to use recursion, taking you out of your for-loop comfort zone. In my humble opinion, maybe the time spent in learning the SML language, which is not the main goal of the course, takes a bit too long, but on the other hand I guess that can't really be helped. Videos are grate and grading procedures are pretty fair. Mind you, the course is fairly time-consuming.",4
85435,Good basic knowledge on PM,4

85511,It could be better if the program include the actual process of risk evaluation such as RCCA.,4

85570,Very interresting course for Python lovers.,4
85571,"Quite simple course for those, who has already learned some python, but has some drawbacks in knowledge of unit testing, exceptions and classes. All examples are understandable and simple.Although expected more about quality code crafting, some hints and best practices, that could help in real life of the developer.",4

85641,a little too short but good,4
85647,"Is a great course for musicians, producers and composer. It's a great DAW",4
85649,"Great introduction to Pro Tools even for the seasoned amatuer who's been playing around with DAWs. I now have basic skills with Pro Tools, plus my editing and mixing skills have improved. This course won't make you a pro but it's a great introduction and well worth your time if you're a newbie or have stalled in your amatuer persuits. **thumbs up**",4
85657,"Great Course. I wish there was more lessons as to how to record acoustic instruments (guitar, piano,drums). I did not know anything about Pro Tools before course, and now I am able to setup a simple recording session. thanks",4
85662,Some creative stereo FX will be better for the course,4
85666,Complicated things made so easy to understand!,4
85678,"Good and quite extensive course. The only drawback I find is the language diversification. Some teachers use English and some Spanish, with opposite subtitles. If I were the organizer, I would suggest video classes in Spanish (as the teachers seem more fluent) with English subtitles, given that Spanish is the 2nd language and English the 3rd. Text classes in Spanish and English alike. Greetings to the excellent teachers and thank you very much.",4

85800,"I enjoy the humor of the instructor and the ease of his presentation. Now, I just need to become familiar with the vocabulary of this industry. Nice job!",4
85802,This was a difficult course for me. I don't have a background in a field that required me to have been involved in projects of the scope that was commonly discussed. I will definitely be reviewing what I learned and look into the resources in more detail. I do think that many of the community service projects that I am often involved in will benefit from a bit more planning and team management. This will give me a solid foundation to work from.,4

85842,"This course gives a concise intro to the basics of project management, largely based on PMI PMBOK guide. The course is useful to get acquainted with or refresh knowledge on project management principles.

As is, I was unable to find a way to ""complete"" in a way that would move the course from enrolled to completed on my profile.",4
85844,Filled with meaningful and helpful insights!,4
85847,"I have just finished the course. The course professor has used real life cases to link up with the course material which helps students to connect well with the concepts being used. Very useful for those who are getting into project management but have not done any specific certification around project management.In fact, I would recommend this course to all those getting into jobs as a bit of project managements does impact all of us even if we are not driving any project.

85895,"It has very good content, specially if you are looking for basic concepts, you can find those here, although it doesn't go deeply on them, gives you what you need to get started, it's a fast pace so you have to keep up, and use of side materials/web to complement the course.",4
85896,Useful course for applying,4
85901,It has been a good overview about how to manage projects. At this level it could be useful also for personal projects and not necessarily for professional ones,4

85905,It would be nice to encurage the students to use a project they are working on to apply the knowlegde while still taking the course.,4
85910,Good overview of project management. Well presented and good examples. Would suggest it as must intro for people who will study project management more in depth and people who work in the non profit sector who may be called upon to organize projects.,4
85914,I love this course. Very specific. With tons of practical information. Good examples.,4
85916,Great course in general. Material is not evenly spread in all 4 weeks. 4th week material takes 4 times longer to cover than any of the previous weeks.Last quiz has an error. The right answer is taken as incorrect.,4

85995,I thought the course was really well mastered and I enjoyed it very much for the posture of the professor.I felt it was well prepaired and things were put in ways to bring the comprehension towards it in a good format.,4
85997,Course was great for helping me understand the various elements of the project I'm currently involved in. I do think the course could benefit from providing handouts that elaborate on what the instructor says and for the instructor to elaborate a bit more (he mostly seems to read or skim through slides...).,4

86002,This is an interesting course containing all the necessary basics for someone interested in Project Management. The instructor supports all the concepts with good use of interesting examples. I enjoyed this course thoroughly.,4

86097,Professor speaks very fast,4

86148,"The basics and overview of project planning and management has been highlighted properly. It helped me get a clearer perspective on how things are being planned and what methodologies are in use at present times. I would love to attend another program on similar lines though I wish next time the cousrse is more rigorous and detailed. Small projects based on the application of some planning software would really add more value to this offereing by the University iof California, Irvine.Thank you Professor Rob Stone",4

86171,Good introduction but nothing news have been presented,4

Additional references, case studies, journals, articles, and books to read on the topics, were very useful.Quiz tests were not hard, but they gave fair understanding of topic.Although some basic concepts weren't covered, the overall learning from the course are worth taking.",4
86190,"Great course! I would add some business cases to complement the learning. Would have been nice to have a brief video on ethics about pricing. I think the course focused a lot in how to get the most profit from a product/service, which I believe if it's considered alone, I might be a bit unethical.",4
86196,Pretty good introduction to the subject.Well qualified instructors as well.,4
86201,worthy enrolling this course.,4

86232,"Very helpful and inspiring course. Dr. McGarrity with a great sense of humor give all the support needed to get over your fears, to stand up in front of a lens, and to deliver a self-confidence speech. But more important, he gives a great example and guideline on how to prepare it. Highly recommended MOOC.",4
86233,"Great content delivered in a manner that is easy to understand and also is useful for non-native English speaker and applicable to at least some of the European languages.What could be improved is adding slides to each of the lectures. Also content wise it felt a bit small, both lectures and assignments required very limited time per week (probably around 2h/wk).",4
86249,It is a very helpful training course for leaders and employees working in different geos.,4
86264,it has been a great course! A lot of information about the topic and diverse and interesting videos!,4
86289,Really well developed. Thanks!,4
86308,I am learning a lot from the course about leadership qualities and communication across culture. The slideshow and reading material really helps with digesting and remembering some of the points made in the video.,4
86311,Applicable to real life situation.,4
86332,"I enjoyed this course and recommend it highly. I just wish the instructions for the exercises were clearer...but I have to admit I had many distractions and other things going, so I could have done better.",4
86340,"An introductory course to Lean Six Sigma and DMAIC. Fairly well presented by Prof. Anand. A primer in basic statistics would be recommended before commencing with Module 3. To the creators: Some lessons were lengthy and I would suggest max video length to be 20 minutes each. All in all - a very interesting and relevant topic. I would recommend this as a ""start here"" to anyone who intends pursuing the more comprehensive and rigorous Yellow/Green/Black belt body of knowledge/certification.",4
86344,Good overview of the basic tools that are used in various process improvement processes. I'd prefer to have a multiple course series reviewing this topic rather than a single course but this is still good for what it is.,4
86353,"I liked the course a lot since it is actually covering most of the things related to the package development. Nevertheless, I still feel (the same as with the previous classes) that authors could have spent more time building the course materials as many chapters are very brief and if I hadn't had the past experience with some of the topics, I wouldn't have any idea what the course is telling me (e.g. merge conflicts in git).",4
86354,"This course provides useful knowledge in building R packages, as well as opportunities to implement our knowledge. However, as the previous courses in the series, the last module (week) is extremely challenging compared to the previous ones.",4
86367,Very basic introduction to Python.,4
86391,Quite practical for web information retrieving.,4
86399,"The course material is great, but the assignment is too simple, especially the last(You don't need to write any codes). I think the assignments can be more challenging.",4
86407,"very useful syllabus,",4
86418,"Now we're cooking with gas. This is course three of five in the University of Michigan's Python for Everybody series and things start to become real. Where Course 1 was very action/reaction in learning Python's basics, Course 2 was more abstract (and the weakest of the three so far), Course 3 builds on the other two and you get to taste Python's real world potential. Granted, this is all an introduction series and nobody is walking away from these courses into a full time developer position - but you do begin feel functionally dangerous (in a good way). The biggest takeaway from the course is giving you that taste of what is possible. We don't know how to do it yet (and the course isn't going to go beyond the intro depth) but after this third course you're likely getting smitten by Python and know you want to avidly take your learning beyond this series.",4
86420,The course is very good. However the course covers only the basics of how to use python to access web data. It would have been good to add an assignment to use REST APIs in the real world scenario.,4
86437,"Dr. Chuck's explanations are clear and all the lessons are easy to follow: focus on relevant web technologies, perfect pace, examples based on popular APIs. As someone with some basic knowledge in programming already I was expecting the assignments to be more challenging. As clearly announced on the website this course is targeted at beginners who took the previous courses from the same teacher: all exercises can be solved in about 10-15 lines of code and the solutions can be directly applied from the videos without much further thinking. The rest of you will, like me, breeze through it in no time. Kudos for the interesting interview videos proposed as bonus material!",4
86446,"An excellent course, Dr. Chuck manages to put various things with ease. Material as well as teaching is excellent. However, I found the necessity of having more programming exercises with more difficulty than what course presently offers. More exercises with higher difficulty are needed to emphasize the material we have learnt. Apart from that, this is an excellent course.",4
86449,Good intro to APIs,4
86451,Great course.,4
86467,There's in a change in the way of presenting the course. I prefer the previous 2 section though.,4
86469,"I felt a big jump in the learning curve once we reached XML and JSON. I could complete the assignments because all I had to do was make small changes to code provided, but I don't feel like I've even close to understood yet! Will keep re-reading the book chapters...",4
86471,This was really a very great experience to have this course. I really had a good time and interest while learning the things. the best part of all these courses are that its very interesting and knowledge feeding,4
86494,Was well structure until the part about accessing parsed data in JSON; this was a little rough as the example provided in the lecture accessed data like: parsedjsondata['person']['age']. In the actual assignment this does not work and I had to use a work-around by using range(len(dictionary)) which is not covered in this course.,4
86495,Very good course showing how to interact with the internet. Assignments could have been a little more taxing but on the whole it gives a flavour of what is possible.,4
86501,Good introduction to getting data from the web. I've used this course to scrape fantasy football data and analyse it in Excel,4
86502,"Once again, another excellent course from Dr. Chuck. However, the Coursera format has changed from that of the previous two courses and the submission of quizzes and assignments are now locked; they don't show progress or get marked as completed unless you purchase the certification. So, if you're auditing the course, don't bother with the quizzes and don't expect the course to show your progress (mine still says I'm on week one) or be marked as completed in your profile even though you've watched all the videos and submitted the assignments.Dr. Chuck, I understand that University of Michigan has to find a way to monetize these courses. However, since the previous courses used auto graders, and this course seems to as well, I'd like to request that the quiz and assignment features be unlocked so auditors can see course progress and completion like the previous two courses.",4
86510,I really appreciate all the hard work put by the professor to make this course a great one and i helped me to see and experience a new side of python which i lack before.All mentors were very helpful and would eagerly take other courses of this specialisation.Thank you all.I had a great learning experience.,4
86514,"Course is good, the problems should have been a little more complex. Thanks to the faculty for such a great course.",4
86525,nice easy course,4
86532,"Lectures are easy to follow, but the homework was a little too easy.",4
86540,"very useful skills and give some specific instructions on accessing to web data. But the examples are a little sample, hope there will be examples of different difficulty level.",4
86555,"This is the third of 5 courses in Python 2.7, so the full 5 courses are excellent for a Beginner to become a solid Intermediate, this Web Access course alone should only be taken by those with some Python programming experience (like the prior 2 beginning courses on programming and data structures in Python). I did the course using Python 3.5, from Anaconda, after starting the more challenging MIT 6.00 courses (2 of them), which use 3.5 but are faster paced yet with more challenging problems. [Some issues switching from 2.7 to 3.5 -- there now is a revised Open Source book using py3x] Dr. Chuck's course offers true high quality learning but allowing me to work my 40 hrs /week and do the course, altho it took me two sessions to finish. Now fully completed after switching to the next later session. NOTE - these MOOCs allow one to switch to the next session when one falls behind; this is better for getting TA help in the forums when there is a problem. Thanks!(above is same as Class Central, below is new)How could it be improved? By having for each required assignment a similar but more difficult optional assignment, which can be further discussed in the forums. I'd expect that switching auto-grade assignments & sample code to be py3.5, especially the print() change, would be fairly easy and allow students to choose which version to do the assignment it.",4
86558,"As usual, another wonderful course. Bit difficult when compared to previous courses. However, we like complexity.",4
86567,Assignments could have been harder. That is most code was as easy as copy paste from sample programs.,4
86571,The lectures are well explained. But the programming exercises are too basic . Expected the programming assignments to be more challenging . Good course but each week could be completed by 2-3 hours . And the 6 week course can be completed within 1 week by casual work . But its a good introduction to access web data using python . Recommended for beginners .,4
86590,it would be 5 star rating if you will provide the deep detail or other practice exercise for Beautiful soup json and rest apioverall great course learn api and i am using Beautiful Soup now very often,4
86600,"the course is amazing , there is much knowledge in here !!Enjoyed every week and every lectureThe instructor is funny and never gets you bored !the missing star is for the tasks, they need to be a bit more challenging",4
86602,"Nice course, you get an introduction to using python to access different types of widely used formats of web data.I liked that, apart from showing how to ""get the stuff done"" with Python, the course also explores a bit of the history of each of the tyeps explored and tries to ""scratch the surface"" about how each of them works.On the down side: I think the code already provided for each assignment is too much. One ends up not writing his/her own code, if not for a couple of additional lines.",4
86607,Excellent course. Needs some more practice material.,4
86609,amazing course,4
86614,Good course.,4
86615,You should provide support for python 2 AND python 3.,4
86617,This was a easy to follow introduction to some python libraries used to access web services.,4
86633,great course although a few things seemed to be outside of both the course and the book.,4
86635,"There are an interesting course, great teachers, wonderful students and l will keep on learning other courses. Thank you !",4
86642,Really useful course for starters in python that want to understand how to connect their application to the web.,4
86648,"The assignments could be a little bit more challenging, on the other hand, they each address some part of the skills I want to learn. Probably I should hold my breath for the capstone. :-)",4
86656,Wonderful course,4
86657,"including beautifulsoup, parsing html,xml and json. good course of basic level for beginners",4
86661,"Easy to follow, teach some basic skills and background informationThis course is helpful for beginners, not for majors",4
86671,Immense gratitude for Dr.Chuck and his team for this great job. This kind of virtual programs can bring knowledge to more population and overcome the educational barrier.,4
86685,A practical course with easy to understand examples. My only grudge is that it is not on Python3.,4
86688,"Useful,but not very deep.Succeeding in giving a general understanding of Python",4
86689,"This course was very well set up, and easy for a person with a reasonable knowledge of Python basics to understand.I would have appreciated a little more in-depth assignments, or perhaps two-stage assignments that delved a little more deeply into JSON and XML use, to expand upon the concepts learned in the first.Overall a fantastic intro to interacting with web data with Python.",4
86697,It Feels VEry Good Learning Python from Dr.Chucks,4
86702,"It's a good course, very well organized, useful and with great interviews of pioneers of the Internet. Not very challenging though for someone who has a few years programming experience with C++",4
86705,"Could have used more graded homework problems. I understand the foundations, but could have used some more solidification",4
86706,This course is good,4
86714,"Course was very good, but could have a module on setting up a client server link using sockets and how to send and request data between the 2. A bit more emphasis on how to create JSON and XML files would also be welcome.",4
86715,I recommend to take this course to all the enthusiast who want to learn and explore PYTHON.,4
86723,"Challenging assignments, great teaching. I don't understand half of what these computer nerds are talking about, but I am figuring out how to complete their assignments. I must be learning something.",4
86731,"Great Course! Thanks to all the staff, Stephen Mentor and especially to Dr-Chuck... I had fun and learned much. Could never imagine i could go this far in programming and all that for FREE. I'm very Grateful to y'all",4
86751,"it just could go deeper, but it is a very nice course!",4
86753,"To easy, but maybe im not the right target audience",4
86759,"I liked the course overall, but assignments are so easy compared to the material given in lectures.",4
86760,"I moved to the US a couple years ago and started my career from scratch in completely different sphere - Quality Assurance. I never supposed myself to be a technical person and felt uncomfortable with IT things. I have in my head the combination of tech terms and tools mixed up with huge gaps, this course helped me to systematize my knowledge and feel more confident and engaged with what I am doing. I completed 3/4 sessions and would rate the first two 5 stars, and probably give a little bit less, 4 stars, to the third one, only because sometimes I had to find on the Internet additional materials which were not covered by lecture and course materials to complete my assignments.",4
86772,"Really interesting course, maybe some higher level exercises are required for a deeper comprehension",4
86774,"Easy to understand explanations and a very motivated teacher!Assignments were too easy though, because 95% of the solutions were already given by the example program. It would have been better to code those few lines from scratch.",4
86799,Great course for those who are complete beginners! the exercises are a bit too easy,4
86814,"good course, maybe a bit too rushed and easy",4
86823,"I found that some parts of the course were confusing. You really have to take the time to read documentation to do the assignments, which was difficult with my busy schedule. (And just because you read the documentation doesn't mean that you understand the code!) Overall, I learned a lot and still recommend the course - just wish there was less background and more explanation of the actual codes that you can use while parsing.",4
86855,Very good course,4
86873,The lectures are very good. I would recommend that more examples be added in the book. This will help students solve problems and understand the concepts better.,4
86898,"I like the teaching-style of the professor.It's very insteresting.Btw,if more the example for accessing web Date, maybe more pratical.",4
86900,"very very impressive course, learn some interesting coding, concepts everyday !",4
86904,Bonus videos are good and motivating,4
86905,"Compared with last two courses, this course is a little more difficult to understand.",4
86906,I found this course difficult than the previous ones and would give a suggestion of adding more weeks if the course syllabus demands.Syllabus of this course is very vast and so lectures must be increased.,4
86915,I really like this course. I will recommend this to all beginners.,4
86925,Not too difficult but learned a decent amount.,4
86934,Very engaging and fun. A little too basic with not enough exercise though.,4
86940,Maybe too easy and too less exercises. The lectures are very clear.,4
86943,"适合新手 还有很多不足之处。There are fewer supplemental materials. I think it can give more import supplementary, especially the most relevant portion of the book.",4
86952,Really a nice course! Dr. Chuck makes it easy to use Python to access web data! Thanks a lot!,4
86972,"Good for learning the basics, includes some neat interviews with people who created the Internet.",4
86977,"Really nice course. Help was available when I needed it, however I think some of the integration of urllib needed to be better elaborated.",4
86986,I would say a very good introduction to the topic.Would be nice if maybe in the future you would add some more advanced excersises ( just to gain more practice),4
86989,Pretty good. It was only a refresher for me.,4
86994,"Awesome starting point for whom wants to know about ""web access using python""",4
86996,Great for beginners. Would be better if assignments were more challenging. Really had fun while learning :),4
87012,"Strange as it may seem, I would have liked more assignments to reinforce all the new concepts I tripped over on my way to finishing this course.",4
87017,"something not clearly explained, maybe I was stupid.",4
87029,good course!,4
87033,I still have a confused feeling of this course's content.,4
87035,Nice course but it needs harder assignments,4
87045,Very well planned course.,4
87048,"This course got very technical very suddenly which was really fun! From normal python to regular expression python, to surfing the web with python (by suddenly writing a web browser) and then suddenly using python to leverage on APIs. Each chapter is a really fun quantum leap in understanding!However, I felt that the lectures could be better delivered for that chapter (less wordy, chunky notes, more examples) because it's really a whole new world each time.Really worth the time and effort though!",4
87052,Excellent - but I wish that the course had tougher assignments to really push me to practice on the topic - although I admit this is hard to grade.,4
87067,Superbly explained. Maybe there should be a intermidiate level to this.,4
87095,GO DR Chuck !!!. Good Course,4
87113,Pretty straight forward to do assignments based on sample codes,4
87120,"I really enjoyed this course and found that I am feeling more confident with my skills from the previous two. However, as a point of improvement I would suggest making the final module a bit more challenging. Perhaps this was intentional but, although the final module introduces JSON well, I don't feel as though my skills improved while doing it. (Then again, the counter argument could be that it is good practice and repetition before moving on to anything too much harder...)",4
87123,The exercises are very simple. It would have been great if there was a final project so that the student can see how to use what he/she learnt in a real application. The videos and the teaching are certainly good.,4
87127,"Great course! The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that assignments are too easy. If we can resolve some real problems, that will be better.",4
87128,"I think this course has many introduction about the logics of Internet, but it's not so interesting as in the previous courses in the same specialisation.",4
87136,Nothing short of being excellent!,4
87144,"This course has helped me learn the basics of regular expression and how to parse html, xml, and json data with simple exercises. After completing the course, I feel ready to apply what I learned to do more complicated tasks with the associated python libraries.",4
87146,Good informative,4
87158,Great course except it seemed little effort was put into explaining the python side of the week 5 and 6 material.,4
87165,After the first two courses this one seems to be much more difficult. Maybe some intermediate course is needed.,4
87168,Interesting,4
87176,Great class. I like the pace and I am learning a lot of useful ways to use python.,4
87182,"through this course , you will have a better understanding for web data",4
87189,"Very good material and instructor; just lacked on two things (under my point of view):1) Development of a simple webapplication to make the communication between webserver and client;2) Implementation of a socket and actually make the capture of a ""stream"" and translate (maybe opening the packets accordingly with the protocol);",4
87194,a little bit hard,4
87197,Good course capturing the basics.,4
87199,More assignments would help us more,4
87200,The form of presentation in the previous courses (video and slides simultanously) were better.,4
87202,Great introduction to using techniques in previous course with online data.,4
87206,"Dr. Chuck class is full of learning and fun. He leads us through everything in a logical manner thus even people who do not have a lot of experience with programming, even they find it easy to understand.",4
87208,Thing go deeper but you can also get the feeling i learned something usefull,4
87210,good times!,4
87212,"Good as introduction course, but short of deep digging",4
87215,This is a great class. I thought the course work was fun to work through.,4
87216,This course is really very useful.The effort given by Dr.Chuck is very appriciateable and this course is very interesting as well because many great programmer told their history of discovered thing.,4
87232,Charles did an excellent job while describing and making a student much interactive in his class. He showed the learning in a very basic way and i personally enjoyed the class. Cheers to the python class :),4
87241,"I did the whole course over about 1 day. I was already familiar with Perl, Regex, HTTP, XML, JASON and web scraping, but totally unfamiliar with Python. Fortunately it did not rely on having done earlier Python programming basic parts too much. Will I do the other parts of Python for everyone? No, I think I would rather work and learn on my own problems.",4
87242,Good course ...,4
87256,"This course felt a little light compared to the other ones in the series, I wish I could have learned more. Beautiful Soup was introduced as a way to do things, but not thoroughly explained as a package. I did appreciate the in-depth explanation of XML and JSON formats. Dr. Chuck is an amazing instructor.",4
87258,"There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters. It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming. Yes, a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot, but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality! Also, I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there (documentation, etc.) could help them. Also, as the students start have to read multiple docs, etc. the time expectations per week should be increased.",4
87264,Quite nice course. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic and the stress levels were at a minimum. Thanks!,4
87285,best teacher everthe programming tasks are actually a little bit too easy,4
87295,was fun learning,4
87312,This course covers a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace. It's not going to teach every aspect of the subjects covered--it couldn't possibly do so in the time--but it teaches enough to allow students to ask the right questions later.I would like to see more searching practical exercises to cement the learning. The existing assignments follow quite closely the worked examples which means those coding along with Dr chuck aren't going to have too much more to do.,4
87320,little more information of the supporting programs that we are using should be provided.,4
87325,Excellent.But sad part is there are not many exercises and exams. Problem are some how simpler(!) not different from done in examples.,4
87330,The course is great and it definitely left me wanting more content.,4
87331,"It's a very practical course. The course is in a good pace. The contents are broken into smaller pieces. Thank you Dr. Chunk for making Python+WebData easy and fun to learn. One little thing I wish was the slides and code could be shown for a longer time, or constantly showing on the screen as the two earlier python course. Currently I had to pause the video couple times to digest the slides or code.",4
87332,"Some typos in the assignments, but otherwise very straightforward course with good information. -1 star for not having python 3 ""support.""",4
87343,Good one :),4
87346,I'd like this course to be more difficult and i'd like it to have more practical exercises,4
87368,"The class is good, but the content in the class is not that much.I think more complex project to solve some interesting tasks in homework will be better.",4
87373,Just starting,4
87376,"A more challenging course, as to be expected in this stage of the specification. It would be interesting to know how much of the underlying code is working",4
87378,"Great kick-off for what I am sure will lead the students to countless hours of solving ""puzzles"" with Python. I wished the assignments would have been a bit more challenging but they definitively fit the purpose.",4
87396,Very helpful topics...Best xml and json parsing lectures ever.,4
87398,It would be great if there were more practice. The theoretical material as always on top.,4
87409,"I found it to be a very useful class on important topics in web analytics. The homework assignments are not very difficult and encourage learning instead of grade-seeking. Plus, Dr. Chuck is an engaging instructor!P.s. I gave it 4 starts because the assignments were a bit too easy at times. My feedback is to include advanced but optional assignments in future sessions.",4
87410,"I prefer the format of the previous courses, where the video of the professor was in parallel to the notes/presentation and did not alternate between slides and video of the professor. It gives you more time to make your notes, and refer to the notes while the professor is talking.",4
87412,"I have really liked the course and the way it has been presented. Although the course doesn't go into too much depth, it still gives a solid introduction to web data parsing and the available tools for the same. I strongly recommend this as a beginner's course.",4
87426,Dr Chuck is a great teacher.,4
87432,All these courses really need to be updated to Python 3. There is no advantage in sticking to Python 2 anymore with Python4 on the horizon,4
87445,"Wonderful lectures, excellent teacher, nice assignments, however bit too easy.",4
87451,"Dr. Chuck is so skilled at teaching. His teaching style and presentations are easy to follow. The class is not as challenging as other Python courses, but it's a great step to learning Python well.",4
87456,Needs updating to python 3 and the requests library to get 5 stars,4
87458,"Once more, I really enjoyed the course and the assignments.the later became sightly harder to get at the end, but with a bit of thinking and testing I got through it.Keep upo the good work.",4
87462,This was a good course to learn how to scrape web data and access apis.,4
87468,Assignments were a bit difficult to be completed with the material explained during the lectures.,4
87469,very good course for beginner. Simple explanation of the essentials needed for web access.,4
87473,"Loved it, it was hard, but i completed. Course needs some updates, there are few mistakes that took me longer time to complete tasks. And i liked the videos when it was Dr Chuck and desktop video in same video, it was more easy to keep along. Now it is harder when you concentrate on the code and then suddenly you lose your concentration when you see Dr. in full screen.",4
87486,for beginners is wary good :),4
87488,"This is a simple, practical course that will teach the basics of how to access web resources with python programs.The goal is not teaching you how to write nice programs, but just enable you to write something working to pull interesting data out of existing data sources like files and web services providing text, XML and JSON data.The videos also feature some interesting background.",4
87492,"Simple, Concise, kind and fun explanations on web data access.",4
87503,"Great course, I would highly recommend it to everyone who want to learn more about XML and JSON and how to use it in Python. The exercises and assignments should be tougher though!",4
87504,Simple and basic intro to Python. Instructive interviews with Internet personalities.,4
87508,"great energy and great class.1. nice assignment website, but it could use a bit file up-load and nosetest to held automate grading.2. I wish they have more web robot, crawling, interesting problem examples.3. peer review would be nice, so a better read-able pythonic programming style can be nurtured.4. wondering if the course grading website can be done in ipython notebook.4. I guess the instructor mention using RESTful, it could be also nice to have an assignment orproject to make a REST server with some database(sql-ed or sql-less).After all there a are lot of big data out there to be accessed and processed.",4
87517,"It was Ok! The preofessor has a good style of teaching, but the depth of material could have been better and the assignments more challenging.",4
87525,Delivered in a simple yet effective way. And straight to the point. Useful to me,4
87527,"A 5 star for Dr.Chuck' teaching, however, some more problems could be given :)",4
87529,"Too easy for accessing web data, with many bonus.",4
87536,"The course is great although a little bit simple or slow-paced. But since it is for beginners I think it is Ok the way it is. You will learn the foundations of accessing the Web Data, so it is a really great starting point. You will enjoy and you will want to learn even more!Dr. Chuck is a great teacher whom I would loved to have at class. He explains things quite clearly, in a funny way and he transmits passion in what he is teaching.",4
87540,"Very good course for beginners. I liked the lectures, they were engaging and bonus videos are nice addition. Exercises were maybe too easy, but still for a beginners course just right. The only problem is there is less practical work than it should be, adding more exercises would be nice, and adding more difficult ones would help better grasp the material. That's why only 4 stars.",4
87541,"An extremely well-structured and useful course. As someone who had only syntactical familiarity with Python, this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language. Moreover, the technical knowledge included (APIs, RegEx, etc) is highly relevant and practical.Given that it's part of an introductory series, the difficulty level of the assignments is understandable. But providing some more rigorous optional assignments can be a welcome addition to the course.That being said, I would recommend it to anyone looking to explore Python and the power it grants with its simplicity.",4
87546,"Easy to follow , nicely constructed",4
87547,Its bit tough to me actually...But lecture was so good....,4
87588,Great course to get you started with web scraping.,4
87590,Very good introduction to python and its application to access web data. Dr Severance makes the process fun and easy to access. I would maybe have appreciate more complicated assessments.,4
87591,"Very good introductory course to learn how you can code to get data from web using different constructs i.e. web crawling, web services, json api etc. Also introduce reg-ex and other programing construct to process the data from web.",4
87596,"Good lectures, good assignments and good professor.",4
87597,"If this course has given more related reading material, it would be perfect.",4
87598,"This is a good course if you are interested in getting to know how to parse html data and xml/json data using python libraries. The techniques you learn can be immediately put to use to do some really cool things with existing APIs like the twitter API, or that of Google and so on.",4
87613,overall covered a lot of interesting material - hope to see more classes that dive deeper into webscraping and not just getting at the basics,4
87614,Well done Professor Chuck and team! thank you once more for this awesome learning experience!,4
87616,"I really enjoyed the course and found it cool how you can write python scripts to act like browser. However the API stuff (especially the twitter one) seemed kind of vague to me, since I don't have twitter.",4
87624,"Great introduction to web scraping, basically teaches you what you need to start doing web scraping on your own. Only remark, why teach urllib instead of requests? requests seems to be the better library.",4
87625,"Good course, I think Charles should avoid explaining the code so in detail sometimes that makes the course pace very slow",4
87629,"We want some details in lecturings, thank you",4
87630,Its a nice course. To the point assignments(could have been tougher !). Lucid explanation. Please go ahead and take it.,4
87648,"Assignments were too easy, and were really ""fed"" to us. Also, I liked better the setting in the previous course where Dr. Chuck was in his office and we always saw his screen.",4
87652,Useful stuff. Room for more difficult assignments.,4
87656,good overview on web scraping using python,4
87658,"Professor and course are great. However, I feel that there weren't enough practice questions to bolster our understanding of the material and the lessons were spread too thin.",4
87667,"Very interesting, Thanks",4
87671,Nice course !Clearly show us the knowledge and skills of python xml json and etc,4
87673,Great Course!Fine videos and lectures.Good examples.Easy assignments!,4
87677,easy but useful,4
87682,"Very good, learnt a lot. Would be even better if this also covers Python 3.",4
87686,Good course. Nice introduction to pythonweb tools. Cool explanations.Highly advisable,4
87691,I personally find this course usefull. It teaches good current toolsDr Chuck is a very motivating guy.In order to get better the course needs more exercises,4
87697,The teacher allows understand the basic concepts through element examples. It's a great course.Thanks.,4
87699,"A very good course, but not as good as the first two in this specialisation.It could do with a bit of editing and strengthening the last 2 exercises.Other than this, Dr Chuck is an excellent teacher and great fun to follow.",4
87703,"An amazing course content!! This is a very enjoyable course about Python language programming. Dr Chuck explains each topic with clarity, which facilitate the comprehension of Python from the beginning. In my personal point of view, I would like to have a more deeply exploration in topics. It could give more tools to learn and complexity to each assignment. The book as supported material is a very good resource for consult through all course.",4
87707,"It was a great course but I felt that the exercises could have been a bit more tough. If the exercises were challenging, then it would be a great way to learn the principle of Read-Search-Ask.Thanks, Dr.Chuck. Looking forward to Databases with Python course.",4
87720,"A very interesting professor! This is my second course in this specialization, and it is possibly I'll take the SQL one as well. However it is too easy. Students still have to take some time learn the modules themselves.",4
87723,This course really teaches me what I wanted to know. Text and sample codes are wonderful. I think it's easier now for me to step up. Thank you.,4
87726,"Very good course, I would like to have seen some more challenging assignment. Other than that, very stimulating and learned a lot about web protocols and data.",4
87745,Great Course. But assingments were to easy to do... :),4
87753,"Very interesting course. But, so fast. I think it could cover more tools.",4
87754,Great,4
87756,"It's an easy course, but good to get into more advance python's stuff",4
87761,"Pretty interesting course, in which I gained a lot of knowledge about access web with Python.",4
87765,Dr Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end. This doesn't ask too much. It's clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session. This course highlights how easy Python is more than anything and that's a good thing. Good coding language for beginners. Good course for beginners or novices.,4
87767,"A few glitches in the assignment content, but overall pretty good.",4
87770,"Great course, great instructor! I've learned a lot, but the assignments are a little easy.",4
87778,Great course and even though the topic was more interesting then the previous 3 courses (interesting as in fun) I didn't like the new format where Dr. Chuck wasn't in a picture-in-picture frame so that we could always see the slides and him at the same time. Many times the slides would cut out to him and it was very distracting as I'd have to pause and go back.,4
87783,"Practical hands-on real life examples, excersises and assignments!",4
87801,It would be much better if the difficulty of programming homework is harder.,4
87803,"Very solid. Good material, and I learned quite a lot.",4
87817,I really enjoyed this course and Dr. Chuck. Can't wait for the next one.,4
87830,"I learn this class ,the exercise is very easy and do not takes pain to try for it.Just so easy",4
87837,a bit short ...,4
87842,The arguments are really interesting and even quite well explained.In my opinion however it should be focused on less topics in order to gain practical skills: there are too much arguments and none of them seems to be explained in depth.,4
87850,The class is awesome! Thank you all!Here is a small piece of advice that it's better to use python3 in the future.,4
87851,"simple but useful, Dr Chuck is a great teacher",4
87852,"I thought this one was better than the first (two) part(s). Short, self-paced, to the point. Easy to follow and implement. Highly recommend this one. (All I wanted is actually the JSON part, but I got so much more.)Quizzes and assignments could be an itch more challenging.",4
87857,"This course is well-developed and well-delivered. If one is a complete novice, start at the beginning of this specialty on one's own schedule (on demand at the speed of light) and at an affordable price ($0) and be confident of significant advances in one's knowledge of internet function, in general, and Python, in particular. It is a brave new world. I often feel like Wylie Coyote staring through my toes. Suddenly realizing things have changed. This course fixes that feeling.",4
87858,Great course. I recommend it to anyone,4
87859,clear and crisp explanations of each topic,4
87866,great course and a great instructor,4
87873,"Content is good, with clear explanation.The programming assignment could be improved by adding more challenging questions.",4
87879,"A good course that gives insight into how data is exchanged over the Internet and how Python can be used to manipulate and use that data. For each chapter, I recommend adding 1 additional programming assignment with a little more complexity.g",4
87887,"Yet another quite good course from Dr. Chuck; it may be a bit too quick on some of the most interesting parts, but all in all still very informative. And entertaining in its own way :)",4
87889,"very interesting course gving an introduction to the use of Python to work with web dataMaybe too quick but in any case, it is a good introduction.",4
87893,"These courses are great introductions to python functionality. The workload is much more reasonable at 1-2 hours per week than many other Coursera courses that I have taken.My only recommendation is to show more current libraries and methods than those presented in the lectures. Fundamentals are important to understanding concepts, but if there are newer and better ways of doing things, they should be presented as well.",4
87895,"Nice lessons but the assignments were very easy, no challenge.",4
87897,This is an awesome and the 'best' course I've taken in my entire career . Thanks a ton to Dr. Charles Severance and University of Michigan for materializing this course.,4
87912,Charles did a great job. Very good lecturing.But the course is not a full course.,4
87926,great class!,4
87951,Repetitive. I already sent this type of course five years ago in college.,4
87958,If you're interested in Public Relations then this is the best stepping stone into the world of PR!,4
87964,Good introductory course to Public Relations. And the male teacher is really lovely.,4
87970,"Course is well organized, speaker is knowledgable and really enthusiastic.",4
87983,Some week cources are great others are too confusing or scatchy.,4
87987,"This course is almost outstanding. Half of the presentations are top-notch reviews of the relevant highlights of their subject matter. Half of the rest are logical, but somewhat perfunctory reviews of similar sets of highlights, and finally, the other quarter are sadly hampered by having no visible organization, with delivery that could only have been improved by rehearsing the narrations a couple of times before the lecture was videotaped. I give most praise to presenters Connelly, Pope, Eibye-Jacobsen, Sørensen, Cuny, and Dahl. These lectures alone make the course eminently worthwhile.",4
87988,"I enjoyed this course immensely! I was a bit hesitant due to its length, however, the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting. A couple of the weeks, the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry. Also, I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation. I feel as though I didn't really understand those concepts until watching that week's as well as the next week's lectures. Finally, the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn't match well to what the instructors actually said.",4
87991,Did not want to take this course for credit. Basically watched all of the videos.Found it very interesting and informative.,4
87992,"Thank you so much for this course, I really enjoyed it!I only gave 4 stars because sometimes it is really hard to understand, especially key words (I am not talking about the accent but the group and family latin names, etc); I constantly had to check the subtitles for these.To be honest I wasn't expecting this content after reading the course title, but it was nice to see evolution from this point of view, great job!",4
87993,"Really informative course, the reason why I rated 4/5 is because the lecturers read much too often from the teleprompter. Obviously they all know the material very well but reading it off a screen doesn't feel very natural.",4
87996,"Great course, a clear and complete introduction to the different aspects of life evolution on earth.A great base to start from. Thank you,Roberto",4
88003,"This was an interesting and enjoyable course. The content was wide and varied. On the whole the lectures were well supported by videos and associated charts and tables..However, I found that one or two of the lecturers', though they tried gamely, were a little unfamiliar with English. I fully understand that almost all of these people do not have English as a first (or second) language and admire their competence. If the transcripts had been corrected so that they more accurately reflected what the speaker was trying to say rather than what was actually said, I feel that would be a help. In spite of this, I would recommend this course to my friends and family.",4
88006,"Excellent course on this topic. I have really enjoyed the process of learning and the knowledge I gathered during the process. More importantly, it has broadened my thinking.",4
88011,informative,4
88012,"Assessment for the last half of the course was on stupid dates and small, boring, unimportant details.",4
88020,A very interesting course with a broad spectrum.Some of the professors might work a little bit on the pronunciation of English!,4
88021,"The course content is very very good and not superficial as some courses we see around here. I liked very much how the order of subjects where build. However, if you allow me to give a *constructive* criticism, please let me say that the strategy chosen to ask lectures to read from previous written scripts, instead of letting them present more naturally, was a bad one. I understand that in order to make the legends/captions available, the lecturers kinda read from scripts their talks and this was very bad. It would be much better next time if you allow each speaker give the talk naturally as they want, with no reading, and then latter produce the subtitles. The lecturers are reseachers and not ACTORS so the final result of reading word by word what they were saying compromised a lot the final quality of their talks. Please don't get me wrong, I just trying to be constructive giving back somehow the time and effort spent by you guys to prepare such nice course.",4
88024,stilVery good and contain very recent data that actually can help people who are isted,4
88025,The professors know very well how to explain the subject,4
88028,"Impressive, one learns a great deal about tasting techniques but also the basics of grape and wine variations. I just wish I had a better for detecting the aromas!",4
88035,"Extremely interesting subject. The exposition is for the most part remarkably clear, though it amounts to a necessarily quick introduction to the vast variety of tecniques and tools. The student is supposed to conduct a lot of practice as self-study and experimenting. Giving 4 stars out of 5 instead of full marks only because I feel this course might work better in an extended format, going more in-depth on real cases and guiding the students through the hurdles and subtleties of such analyses.",4
88036,Great course!,4
88072,Interesting,4
88073,"Great course, a lot of fun with the practical assignments",4
88075,The course content aptly covers the topics,4
88076,Good course with hands on projects. I wish it was a little longer...,4
88081,Needs to be a little more technical and kick up the level of difficulty a notch or two.,4
88089,very interting topic but maybe not deep enough,4
88096,"Ok, really good",4
88100,"I enjoyed the course, was easy to follow, but I would rather prefer something more challenging",4
88105,Material is explained well and the comprehension checks along the way are helpful.,4
88108,"Really helpful course, though discussion forums seemed to be available at the end of the course, they wasn´t really available. Presentations sometimes ask you to go to those unavailable forums. Teacher was great (and has the same name as my mom :D) But had some grading issues with 2 questions on quizes",4
88110,"I really enjoyed the mathematical point and percentage explanation and the tools to grade assignments enlightening . I always have struggled with the math of grading. I felt that the first and second weeks were very repetitive information; therefore I didn't give it a five star. Otherwise, I thought it was good information. Thanks",4
88113,Easy and complete,4
88119,"Good course to know the basics of IoT and AR, the references are very helpful to deep in the topics.",4
88122,Helped me a lot in gathering information for my project.Please also include more videos to help in understanding topics better.,4
88139,"the referenced materials are so Amazing , the Lecturer is explaining in detail",4
88143,"Course covers very brief outline of concepts in 3g/4g, wifi, bluetooth. Something kind of introductory course to newbies. But this course is not much useful as it lacks depth in each topic. Need some more advanced course.",4
88149,Very useful and learnt lot of important concepts.,4
88152,Excellent Lectures on emerging technologies like 4G and 5G.,4
88153,I really like this course and got a lot of information about Wireless Technologies.Many thanks for both ( Coursera.org & Yonsei Instructor)Best regards,4
88156,"This course provides an overview that enables significant understanding of the wireless world built around the person. One suggestion, the number of acronyms could be reduced or be presented in a simplified way.",4
88157,It would be great to achieve free certificate,4
88158,Really Good,4
88160,good course,4
88169,Good introductory course. No labs involved. No certificate issued.,4
88173,Its short and informative about the wireless technologies.It would be better to concentrate on a single technology and go in depth .,4
88174,"Great course, Great Instructor, Definitely Great Knowledge! Thank you so much.",4
88176,Test review,4
88177,very good course,4
88179,Wonderful course for the beginners in learning communication technologies and their limitations,4
88183,this program is very intersting and informative to me.,4
88184,Fabulous and interesting course which not only clears our doubts regarding wireless communication technologies but also helps us to improve the fundamentals of the era of communication.,4
88189,Loved it. I really like the videos as well.Wish there were some mini assignments as well.,4
88194,The teaching was awesome. I had already taken course in Mobile Computing during my Under graduate study. I suggest you develop a course with in depth concepts covering more technical details.,4
88196,Course was good for any Beginner. May be more technical details would further help,4
88199,Very useful course. Clear explainings.,4
88211,Very interesting,4
88215,too much emphasis on acronyms. Not enough time spent on understanding the concepts,4
88218,The course is too short and not really detailed but very informative. And too bad you can receive a Statement of Accomplishment.,4
88222,It is a good intro of the topics.I think the course is simple and very educational.,4
88224,would have given 5 if the assignments were more challenging :),4
88227,"it's good and very helpful,and i enjoyed it",4
88239,I liked doing the project for hands on training but did not care for students grading my project.,4
88244,its a great course... quite interesting and applicable,4
88249,"There were challenges not having a project management software like Microsoft Project available to be able to set up the predecessors and schedule. After reviewing many peer projects I may have been too detailed in tasks thereby making my project more complicated. I did get all the elements covered. Some of my entries were focused sections that met the grading criteria.Yes I have completed the ""Specialization"". I am in sticker shocked at the $749 for each subsequent courses in order to get a PMP certificate.",4
88271,It was an amazing experience. T,4
88282,"This was a good introduction to the principles and concepts of project management. I completed this course as part of professional development for my current job, and learned some good terminology and best practices. If you have experience with project management or want to learn more advanced concepts, I imagine this course would not be for you. If you're looking for a good introduction to project management that you can build on later, this is a good place to start.",4
88283,Capstone provided an opportunity to make use of various concepts learnt during the specialization. The level of course coverage and difficulty level was moderate,4
88288,"Thank you, for the knowledge you gave to me through these beautiful Courses.",4
88307,I think tha the evaluation wasnt correct but despite that everythin,4
88308,Though but its well worth the time.,4
88320,"It was a good exercise, but there were some inconsistencies between the assignment rubric that was published and the grading key the students use to evaluate your work. More alignment between these two would be helpful.",4
88322,A practical approach on the topics we've been studying in all previous courses and an effective way to apply that knowledge.,4
88326,"This capstone project helped me to design a pilot project plan for one of my dream projects. From this experience, I would be able to develop further, my knowledge in project charter planning and designing",4
88334,"I am new to Linux, this course teaches handful of commands to use RaspberryPi and great details about python.",4
88335,I enjoyed this course. It is well structured and a very good introduction. I only audited the course.,4
88336,Need a discussion forum.,4
88338,"Content is interesting, even the Twitter section (which looks unrelated to the main goal of the course). Some classes were recorded using Python 2 while the course targets Python 3.",4
88357,very good for beginners and lecturer is very nice .,4
88358,"Very informative and explained in a simple, understandable manner.",4
88363,"I am a newbie with R.Pi so this course help me a lot in the studying process with R.Pi. I gain many new interesting knowledge.I wish the learner could take the quizzes and know the results without upgrade, that would be better. I agree once the learner need to print the results and some official certificate, so need to upgrade.",4
88365,Good content as long as you have some familiarity with programing and computer configuration.,4
88369,"Good course, but I expected something a little more detailed and to last a little longer. The videos were good, but w little long for the amount of content that they contained. For instance, a few videos could be compressed to the size of one video and still contain the relevant content.",4
88372,"Nice course, but could be better supported.Video: On Programs on whiteboard several wrong syntax (UC/LC writing)Better: Not just there's the doc on web - study it - rather point on important things on doc and make tests.End of week 4: Second link to program is missing, when making peer review, everyone can learn so much from each other.Pi Hardware: I missed awfully electric characteristics on GPIO. Looking on the web, anyone was talking about this matter (max. 50mA total all outputs, max. 3-16mA ?? each...). A little electronics guide how to dimension LED resistors and pullups / pullsdowns and how to drive relais would be nice. Many student know surely less about electronics, but to interact with IoT it is nessecary.Coursera: Not on all platforms (iPad i.e.) you can make positive comments when reviewing.",4
88377,Good for total beginners. If you have even some level of experience with programming/fiddling with computers this is too slow paced.,4
88381,"Great content, and I really like Prof. Harris' way of explaining things.",4
88382,Pretty brief and informative.,4
88384,a nice course to learn the basics of python and raspberry pi programming!!,4
88387,Could be made better by teaching linux basic syntax for LXTerminal,4
88389,a nice introduction course for beginners。,4
88390,"The course has the best introduction to raspberry pi , very useful .",4
88391,"Nice course. Gives a good thousand-foot view of the Pi, Python programming, and how you can use Python to manipulate the GPIO pins on the Pi.",4
88406,Very good course.,4
88419,"A nice, if a little basic, introduction to the Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer and to controlling the Raspberry Pi using Python.",4
88424,"I liked this course. There were no alternatives of the course covering such subject before and I am glad of appearance of this course. I rated it 4 stars, because there still is space for course improvement, but I recommend very strongly to attend it if you are interested in subject.",4
88427,"Good course, professor Ian is very good. Only I miss a more deep discussion and maybe more complex assignments. Thanks a lot!",4
88429,"Since it's the penultimate course of the certification, I expected to contain more practice projects. It's the only downside from my opinion. Course material is excellent, and instructor knows what he is talking about.",4
88434,easy for newcomer! Great!,4
88435,Excellent course! I think that it could touch more difficult topics and homework could involve some deeper practice regarding programming and hardware.,4
88440,"Although I missed the input of TAs, mentors and the Professor and didn't find the generalised thread as useful as the classic Coursera forums I still found the course to be interesting. As with the Arduino course I found the Demos to be the best part. I'm hoping I'll learn a lot in the second RPi interfacing course. I think it would be especially good if the RPi and the Arduino were connected in the next or some later course. I think also that some interaction between the Professor and the material on the presentation would enhance the lessons. What I enjoyed most was actually writing the programs and getting the circuits to work.",4
88442,"So far good. I really like the ""smaller detail without too much detail"" approach. The RaspberryPi is easy to master given excellent support by the Pi Foundation but then there is little too much to access. This course kind of streamlines what one needs to know. I have been using the Pi since 2 months but already feeling more confident thanks to this course and I have just finished only Module 1.",4
88443,Good for anybody that want to start learning Raspberry Pi. Lectures are concise and get you experimenting quick.,4
88453,"I liked all the content though I thought presentation of it was a bit boring, a lot of the what not to do examples were a bit obvious or extreme rather than attempting to shed light on the subtle mistakes one might be inclined to do. Some of the quiz questions seemed almost purposefully confusing or worded in a trick way, which felt a little pointless. Otherwise I've enjoyed everything I've learned and would definitely take another PFA course, maybe a level 2 or something.",4
88459,"Great course, learn a lot about how to listen and correctly ask questions. Using RAPID model is a good way to help people in need during a disaster. :) Thank you!",4
88472,Good course - learned a lot and will use it in the future,4
88478,This course is a good way to start anyone on learning more about how to help others in distress. You don't need to be a trained clinician or mental health expert to learn about psychological first aid. I think it would benefit communities tremendously if more people can learn about PFA.,4
88481,Very easy to grasp and very useful.,4
88483,"I enjoyed the practical videos, but the lecture slides had too much text on them, I think.",4
88484,"An excellent course at the hands of Ph.D. George S. Everly, Jr. Intended for those who are in the area of education and social care with no or little knowledge about mental education. I recommend it for those who think that it could support them to face humanitarian crises.Thank you!",4
88489,"Great course! Sometimes it got a little bit boring and in the next moment the important information was too fast spoken to me (no native speaker) - but i enjoyed, that some complicated sentecnes have always been repeated in more simple language without too many foreign words! I also enjoyed the videos with the false/correct methods which were shown. Dr. Everly has a good voice and pronaunciation, so that i was able to listen. also great, that the quiz has no timelimit, like questions need to be anwered in 3 minutes, because i had to translate a view words into german to understand the questions and this needs time. thanks!",4
88490,"Very good introductory course which will give you a solid basis to continue exploring the subject. The lectures are well structured and paced. It includes ""real life"" examples of how to implement the theory you just learned.",4
88494,"This course was very informative and helpful, especially for a beginner's course. I wish I would have been exposed to different scenarios of situations people face. For example, dealing with a death, mass shootings, terrorist attacks, more natural disasters like earthquakes or tornados, and even abuse. However, learning the basic terms and how to approach and speak to others was very helpful. Thank you!!!",4
88495,"This Content mainly focused on Disaster Survivor's psychological support.However, I am still looking for like daily basis psychological support.For example, employees' stress, children's stress. etc.",4
88504,"A great course for anybody working outside the field of mental health, and interested in psychological first aid. Too basic for psychologist or mental health workers, but wonderfully summarised.",4
88505,"Great exposure to the topic, great presentation!",4
88522,I like the course it is very informative and all those skills are simple and easy and these things can be able to cope up by those who are in need of help!,4
88523,very helpful,4
88533,"I found the course informative, interesting and well presented, with two exceptions:a. There was some use of profession-specific terminology/jargon, which is problematic when addressing a target audience from outside the same profession.b. It is repeatedly stated in the course that no two interventions are done the same, and yet only one intervention simulation is used. I would have liked to see multiple simulations covering a range of possible interactions, to afford a more comprehensive understanding of survivor reactions and appropriate intervention responses.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found myself eager, at the end of each lesson, to get stuck into the next.",4
88535,"This was a good course filled with great information and various techniques I think are useful in everyday life as well as in disasters. I do feel like the concepts could have been explained better and I would have liked more elaboration on certain things that are in the assessments. I struggled quite a bit in the assessments, especially with questions regarding the simulations with Gina. I felt like I had a good understanding of what was being taught until did my assessments and received a low grade. I personally would prefer if things were slightly more spelled out for us so that there is less to intuit. I also prefer reading the transcripts along with watching the videos as I learn better that way, but I don't feel like the transcripts for this course were written well or had good grammatical structure. I often had to go over things many times, or refer again to the video, to understand certain points. For example, I feel that in transcripts it's unnecessary to always directly quote each and every word being said by the speaker like the following, ""...and, and, you know, this is, this is something very important..."" but rather typing ""...and you know, this is something very important..."" would make as much sense and be easier to read and digest.",4
88536,"As a clinical psychologist, this course helps me put things into more grounded perspective. For example, upon how should I teach others to facilitate distress of the people next to them, and how to take care of themselves before attend to others.",4
88551,"Very helpful information. I could use more pointers on how, precisely, to do the ""Intervention"" phase - more practicals. Thanks!",4
88569,"A very basic but thorough introduction to the world of psychological first aid. The class includes a single sample intervention that is referenced at the end of every unit. The actors (including Dr. Everly himself!) seem very well-rehearsed, and this single encounter makes for an excellent template for how to apply the RAPID model in real life!",4
88570,Useful knowledge. Even for everyday life. Take it and learn it !,4
88576,It's a great and informative course.,4
88577,useful and it make sense in emergency,4
88581,Concise. Would give it 5 starts if there were more simulations.,4
88583,i learned some valuable skills during this course. it was useful for reflection - remembering to look after yourself as well as others is very important. i will definitely be able to use the information and skills along with my medical training in my daily working life. thanks.,4
88587,"It was a very good course - simple but had all essential components.... would have loved it if there were one more simulation for a different situation throughout the course.... Rest, it was a great learning..",4
88594,Good introduction to the subject and importantly leaves you wanting to explore a bit more,4
88607,This course could also perfectly be a self-paced course,4
88608,"Great course a few problems, actually had problems with all video review during tests not playing and only having a blank screen so I wasn't able to review specefic videos through the tests. Loved the senarios though.",4
88614,I am very happy to be able to refresh learning more of this skill as I will not know when things can happen. I would like to be able to do something if it does even when there are particular help groups to sweep on the field so to speak..Learning the skills gives me the confidence that I can make a difference however small it may be.THANKS a lot for boosting my knowledge.,4
88616,The PowerPoint slides are informative yet lengthy and boring at times. I hope Coursera can do something to make the lecture more interactive and less monotonous.,4
88626,A good overview of this important subject which I hope to use in my physical risk management workplace.,4
88632,"It was a little confusing as to what we were supposed to do with the websites. I know it was an ""optional"" project, but it looks like I can't even go back and complete it, and it seemed like a fun project.",4
88635,Auto-grading would have been a better option in this course.,4
88649,"Course is great but I'd prefer that the tasks required writing code or editing the given code to complete the task it'll help more, but over all course was great.",4
88652,I still think that there is a lot to learn. the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to.If I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better.generally the course is very good for beginners. The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning.,4
88658,"Although it does not contain new content, it puts all the content from the specialization together. It could be more challenging.",4
88659,A nice way to sum it all up and see the potential.,4
88671,"This is an excellent introductory course to computer programming. It gives you all the opportunities to learn at your own pace.It is not too difficult to clear the capstone itself, but the course gives you the opportunity to chose your own project which makes it all the more interesting.",4
88674,This course is made so that you create something on your own if you just want to pass the assignments then the course won't be a challenge but if the projects are interesting to you and you want to do something creative then you have the right course .,4
88677,"It was a very good course. However I would like we were need to code a little bit more. I know it´s up to us how much we do and how difficult we do our task, but I would be nice if we had to write a bit more on the assignments.",4
88686,"Very good course, though a bit less challenging than I have expected. A true capping of the previous courses.",4
88689,"The sample solution and explanations are very good since it gives a complete whole picture of doing a big data analysis project. The assignment is very easy, but good to get the specialization.",4
88695,This projects in this course tested all the knowledge that i had acquired before. The projects were challenging enough and well prepared.,4
88715,"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run.",4
88720,Coursework was quite easy. Used a lot of the techniques learned in the other courses. You'll get the most out of this course if you have a data analysis project that you want to do. For us this wasn't required. But doing my own project was the most fun part :),4
88722,Many thanks to Professor Chuck that put so much effort on this course.,4
88729,I wish it was more hands on.,4
88745,Too easy. :),4
88746,The professor makes it easy to follow. I appreciate it.,4
88759,"Was a pleasure to study. I feel this was a satisfactory entry into the study of philosophy. I quite enjoyed the final portions in week five, particularly that of Sir Richard, and his discussion of the logic of time travel.",4
88771,Nice introduction in basic philosophical concepts.,4
88773,"good course, just needs to be a little more thorough",4
88780,"Fun, informative course that doesn't take too much time. I would suggest it for people who are new to learning Philosophy, because it may be too simple for people with a decent knowledge of philosophy.",4
88782,"Great course, it exposed me to quite a few ideas but i only felt that we could've gone deeper into the topics. For an introductory course, it was quite informative though!",4
88786,"My English and thought process was challenged, and I enjoyed it :-)",4
88790,"Thoroughly enjoyable with all the different lecturers . I related to a lot of philosophers . Made me wish i could belong to an era where i could make use of all that was learnt and discovered and theorized at that time. It was rather brief , though. I mean there's no way to explain it all an stick to the guidelines that fit the coursera code , but enjoyable none the less. Makes you really want to scratch your brain and question everything , which I personally , believe is always a good thing.",4
88792,Where is the course discussion forum? It definitely needs one!Why was determinism taken as granted in the lectures? It is a highly disputed topic which undermines most of the free will arguments that were shown.,4
88795,Never thought I would be interested in philosophy - that was the start of my adventure.,4
88796,Such a good course!,4
88797,"This is an excellent course but some complex topics could have been explained more like Quantum indeterminacy and the time / travel part to help the new person grasp the idea. However, its an excellent course to start with!!",4
88798,it was a good course,4
88800,Very good as a broad introduction.,4
88801,Nice intro to topic,4
88805,"It was amazing, It contained the basics of a very wide area of knowledge",4
88812,Very well made introductory course,4
88815,Very interesting and thought-provoking!,4
88821,Good Introduction!,4
88838,"Interesting, and well worth my time... I only give it four stars as I am kinda stingy.. ;)",4
88844,Great introduction to Philosophy! I think the last couple of weeks could've been done a bit better as they're quite niche forms of philosophy but other than that it's great.,4
88847,"I liked this course because of the calmness and dedication of the teachers, the reliability of the resources and the attractive topics that were selected.Although I must recognize that sometimes the long extension of the additional resources didn't allow me to read them all.Despite of that, the course was great and I enjoyed it.",4
88858,"Good course. It covers various disciplines in philosophy (e.g. of science, of mind, ethics), with interesting presentation and discussion topics. However it doesn't feel very systematic. It feels more like a series of videos about philosophy than a holistic course at philosophy.",4
88860,There are many more interesting themes in philosophy,4
88869,"It is a simple and generic overview of some of the areas in philosophy, mostly contemporary philosophy. It allows me to explore some basic ideas and concepts without going too deep, which is great because it is what I am looking forward to in this course. Thank you professors, I appreciate your efforts in making the lecture appealing and reflective ( by visiting museums, wearing clocks/watches, visiting graves haha ). :)",4
88870,"great, perhaps the tests doesn't work very well",4
88877,very nice introductory course looking at questions of,4
88879,"The course material is mostly good if a bit basic at times. If the notes went a little more in depth, or the suggested resources were a little less bulky, it would be 5 stars.",4
88883,From an engineer perspective this was hard to see obvious value in but i enjoyed the thought provoking topics. Some of the tests were very hard and the questions were not directly form the lectures while others were. Some presenters were hard to understand due to accent.,4
88884,"Very well done. Most of the instructors use introductory language and do not refer to advanced theories, philosophies, and philosophers with which students may not be familiar.",4
88888,This course provides a comfortable introduction to the subjects of each module. My only dissatisfaction with the course lies in its brevity; I would happily retake a future offering of the course which included not only additional modules but also further lectures on related survey topics within each module so as to acquaint students to greater breadth in historical and contemporary philosophy.,4
88892,Very informative and engaging. Covers a wide range of material without feeling cumbersome.,4
88893,"Good course, very arbitrary chosen topics though",4
88894,Nice introduction to the subject and I'm just taking one point off for the organisation of the material presented.,4
88897,"Very good introduction to philosophy. The amount of work and care that was used to create this course is clearly visible in the videos with the speakers, backgrounds, video and sound quality. Thanks very much!",4
88898,"is a very good course to start in the world of think,",4
88899,A very clear discription to the basics of philosophy - I am happy that I have joined the course!,4
88906,"In as much as I enjoyed the course at times the dialect was difficult. However, the reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars is due to a lack of ability to have receive an answer to a difficult question answered by an instructor as opposed to another class participant who necessarily did not have any better grasp of the question than myself. Given that I certainly enjoyed the course overall.",4
88910,"I took this course just to listen to the lectures as an intro to the subject. One of the prof's accent was so heavy that I couldn't understand her well enough to listen to her lectures so had to skip that part. Other than that, it was enjoyable. I don't know if it was a good intro or not, complete enough or whatever... but it was generally interesting.",4
88914,"Great lectures and nicely explained, apart from one lecture (6th - maybe it was me, not understanding the topic properly). For the future, I suggest to have more ""visible"" support of the lecturers; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates. Moreover, and I am speaking subjectivily, I found all topics very simple. To deepen my understand, I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge.Thank you for your effort!",4
88916,Very helpful introductory course for people who are interested in philosophy. Varied topics in each module and rich reference reading materials. The only problem I found is the lectures in some modules are too simple and not as inspiring and thought-provoking as some others.,4
88919,"A very good introduction to major branches of Philosophy. While some questions on assignments were rather vague, and some lectures rather dull (I don't think I bothered watching the videos from the third week on... just relied on the- excellently put together!- handouts). Overall, a great course to take for a beginner to the world of Philosophy :D",4
88923,It was very interesting and of great relevance to many aspect of my fields of interest. They even had a special lecture on the philosophy of time travel that was a cherry on top of the cake!,4
88924,"Great introductory course, although somewhat short. I wish there would be more lectures, especially by prof. Michela Massimi. I will definitely take the ""Philosophy and the Sciences"" course, which seems to broaden some of the themes touched upon the week 6 of this MOOC. I am also looking forward for other courses by the University of Edinburgh.",4
88926,"Very good, too short though",4
88931,"Two last lectures (week 6 and 7) are the most informative ones, giving a large pool of sources and information in an excellently structured way. It would be nice to expand bibliography for other lectures and add handout or transcript for week 4 because I actually was studying the materials, not watching videos. Thank you!",4
88934,Useful and simple. All things that a philosophy student needs.,4
88940,A good intro course to rewind an old knowledge or tu star up in this path of tought.,4
88941,"I've enjoyed a lot most of the lectures and the activity in the discussion forums is very interesting! I like how professors have directed this course and how it allows everyone, whatever his background is (my field is biomedical sciences), to learn about these themes. I'd definitely recommend it!",4
88942,Very interesting but the video ended abruptly when I was expecting a question. There appears to be no link to the next part of the course. I would have found a facility to rewind helpful.,4
88952,"It's a great introduction to the variety of philosophical topics, being introductory it just scratches the surface though. Could be made more interesting, but nonetheless a good course to get started with philosophy.",4
88955,I really like this course so far. The Instructors do a great job in explaining the material. I look forward to learning more..,4
88959,Brilliant course to get you a head start on 'Philosophy.',4
88963,it was really nice to know somethings about philosophy specially in a simple way,4
88965,'Introduction to Philosophy' is very insightful. The fundamentals of philosophy is explained in a way which is so easy to understand. Very good program.,4
88971,"Classes were interesting apart from a bit of pronunciation problem to understand the professors, I guess the course was informative and lays down a foundation for thinking about the wider problems around.",4
88974,"The course is great. The informatiion is objective, easy to process and good, the only bad thing about this course is that even though it has spanish subtitles all the test are in english which makes them way to hard to resolve. If you give the option of spanish subtitles on an english curse at least translate the test too.",4
88979,"Very interesting ... from the beginning, the teacher shows the pupils, to open mind and think better",4
88980,"An exciting and worthwhile introduction to the philosophical fundamentals! While there was not as much focus on the major philosophers themselves as I was expecting, I gained a lot from this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about philosophy.",4
88991,Very well organized course. If you are looking for a way to get into philosophy this is definetly one of the best options.,4
88999,I was very impressed by how the subject was broken down into digestible bits. Well done.,4
89005,"Great course touching on very interesting philosophical topics and arguments around them.Not all classes have the same level of clarity, and some of them brush past certain topics a bit too fast, but overall it's a great experience and totally worth one's time.Recommended to anyone who wants to think more about the way we think, and the world we live in.",4
89009,"Lots of interesting ideas, most presented very well. Hit-and-miss for some of the topics, but usually spot on. Recommended",4
89020,Great job on this course!!. It honestly stretched my critical thinking and even frustrated me greatly. Glad to pass this !!! Highly recommended for critical thinkers !!,4
89028,I enjoyed this course immensely. I wanted to gain a general idea of what the science or belief behind Philosophy was. This course gave me just that. A good over view of the subjects and the ideas behind it.,4
89031,Nice teachers!!!!,4
89032,The certificate is paid. It should offer a free version of some kind.,4
89035,"Thanks, is a excelent course",4
89038,"a lovely introduction class. touches some of the most important philosophical fields and multiple approaches to said fields. if you are into philosophy in a beginner level, you should check this out (for the fancy steampunk clothes in week7 if nothing else)",4
89041,This is course is actually informational and interesting...Thnak you,4
89045,"Great tasters to the field, would also be very interested in an overall schema of Philosophy and its various branches and maybe even supported by a major highlevel roadmap of key philosophers and major arguments as an overall introduction to the field for the novice (like me!), that is considering further study. Might be an opportunity as have not been able to find one as yet on the web .. ?",4
89055,"Great material, greta program and greta discussion. I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot. I recommend this to any one who wants to be challenge out of ""confort zone"".",4
89056,"A very good introduction to some of the fundamental and important ideas in philosophy, delivered in an engaging and straightforward fashion. Highly recommended.",4
89057,I thought it was very good and the instructors were excellent.,4
89060,It is a very wonderful clan of Philosophy,4
89065,"Course was great. I completed it at my own pace and enjoyed most subjects covered thoroughly. My favourite week was about Metaethics. I enjoyed it greatly and am continuing studying that in my spare time. The one complaint I would have is that I found it difficult to understand the lecturer covering scientific philosophy, as her accent was quite thick.",4
89069,"It is a pretty good course in understand the basics of philosophy and get a sense of what philosophy is doing. The reference materials are really great and can help you gain a deeper understanding of course materials. However, the course is more limited to introduction and does not go in-depth.A good course if you want a taste of philosophy.",4
89070,Overall a good and balanced course.,4
89075,It's a great course to start the process of understanding the context on which philosophy as a subject deals with.,4
89082,"I enjoyed this course very much. Like many survey courses that are well-conceived, this one stimulated enthusiasm for learning more about some of the topics. So much so in my case that I have enrolled in another course from the University of Edinburgh relating to philosophy and science. I expect it will be equally thought provoking as its delivery involves some of the same faculty.I believe this course would be improved if there was a mechanism for constructive feedback on missed exam questions that illustrate how the questions at hand are integral and in context to the presentations and supplemental readings (some of which I pursued). Simply referring a student back to the course outline does not assist learning when a student does not understand why a chosen answer is incorrect in context. I realize this is a tall ask for an online course. In my own experience as a university faculty member having developed computer assisted instruction and simulations (physiology and anesthesiology) there is no replacement for contact and conversation with an engaged teacher whose interest lies in helping people learn. That said, I reflect that my constructive comments are made in light of my overall satisfaction that this course has succeeded in stimulating interest in learning more about the interface and complementary nature of science and philosophy.Borrowing a phrase from the course itself, ""well done"".",4
89087,Well created and gives plenty of food for thought!,4
89088,"A great introduction to many philosophical areas, well planned, well tested and with very good professors. The only downsides were a couple of slightly ambiguous questions (which, having just watched an hour of philosophical teaching one could easily start wondering what they technically meant) and, to utter frustration, lack of a statement of accomplishment. Nevertheless, if philosophy is of it's own right your target, it is a course well worth taking.",4
89090,"It was very fun and educational, some of the people where a little hard to understand but I liked the fun approach to learning and the material covered!",4
89092,"Interesting course, though It shows me how difficult is for me to understand everything. I was difficult to follow it because the videos were too slow and sometimes I went away. besides I wanted to download the Transcriptions and sometimes it was imposible in the iPad. near the end of the course I found out that I needed to close my session on the iPad to be able to have access to my course with my laptop. It is true that I am learning English an maybe this is a hard course for me.. Or maybe it is because I am not a philosopher even If I love them.",4
89095,I am compelled to maintain interest in the lectures and I have so far completed the second week. I think it is a good class and hope that it can only get better.,4
89099,Wonderful journey seeking ultimate truth. Young philosophers are great assets.,4
89101,"I think the selected topic were really interesting ones but since i´m not a scientifical backgrpund it was kind of difficult to follow some of the discussed concepts and ideas. And that was because not always these were explained from the very beginning and a lot of them were only mentioned, as it was supposed that we had to know them previously. Maybe with a little more time for the videos this would have been solved.In any case I really enjoyed it and I think it is important to have the opportunity to watch these courses and come to learn where are the stages of these matter. Thank you for the effort!",4
89106,You didn't give me an Honor Code Certificate!,4
89107,"Raise some philosophical questions for brain storming. However, not much direction of exploring further where philosophy should go.",4
89125,Having different instructors for different modules is confusing,4
89128,"I enjoyed the course and succeeded, even though I was a totally beginner in Bootstrap and almost a totally beginner in HTML CSS. I'd like to admit that it is well organised, quite understandable and not really hard. Although you need to know English at the level of intermediate, be patient and have a wish to succeed while learning.",4
89131,"Very Nice course good to get a hold of how HTML, CSS and JavaScript works",4
89132,"With much self-initiative and supplementary materials/tutorials found elsewhere on the web , I was able to grasp the concepts of this class. If you are self-driven and intellectually curious, this class is for you. OTOH, If you expect everything spoon-fed to you, then you will not pass. Must have a passion forself-taught learning and finding/reading/grasping content, particularly as concerns javascript. Practiceand repetition are the only way to succeed with javascript.",4
89145,"I thought this course was great in the information it provided, though it moved a little fast for me as a beginning programmer. I think it would be useful to add a separate course just on Javascript to the specialization, as I still feel pretty lost with JS and the introduction of JQuery and Meteor on a shaky JS foundation is quite hard to grasp without a lot of supplemental information from other sites.",4
89148,It was good and I learned a lot!,4
89151,Very interesting topics.,4
89154,Amazing course.Helped a lot!,4
89161,"Great, helped me understand data driven websites and how to use JSON data with a template.",4
89162,The final assignment is challenging. But it would benefit a lot if you work hard to finish it.If there is more detailed instruction for the assignment would help the students finish the assignment.,4
89170,"Sometimes not all aspects were properly explained, but I liked the course overall. Would definitely recommend.",4
89172,"It is better than the previous course, but there were problems with the last assignment in which a lot of students could not acces to the details of the last assignment and the problem was not solved by the staff of the course. It was a fellow student who did a copy of the details of the assignment and let the others courserians the possibility to submit the assignment. For this reason i gave 4 stars.",4
89183,Great intro to web developing.,4
89186,"The grading criteria for the assignments were not quite strict enough in my opinion; it seemed like people had the option of creating relatively lame pure HTML websites that still more than met the minimum passing requirements for some of the more advanced assignments. I.e., Bootstrap or Handlebars should be a requirement to pass an assignment about Bootstrap or Handlebars.",4
89191,Its nice .But i don't have time for Assignment work .i feel good on templates.,4
89198,Great content,4
89203,"Great course, I've learned a lot. I went from knowing little to know a lot!!. However the time I spent in the assignments is not exactly what was expected, I took probably 10 times more tan the expected time since the level of the last two weeks gets really high and lots of info is missing in order to complete assignments. Hope you improve this next time.",4
89211,this a very brife interested course to begin your responsive design .,4
89212,I thing it is necessary more information about handlebars.,4
89214,Learned something new in this course. I appreciate that.,4
89218,Great course!However some lectures were reused from another specialization and they didnt fit well on this version,4
89219,Great course - learned a lot. Very useful and relevant information.,4
89223,"Very nice course with solid foundation and great examples. One recommendation would be to split the material on Week 4 into 2 weeks: Week 4 and Week 5. The teachers would have more time for explaining every bit in the lectures so the difficulty would step up evenly between weeks. Other than the amount of material on last week, it is a good course and highly recommended!",4
89224,"It's really cool course for beginners!My little advice: Why lector's don't use the possibilities of Sublime? Sometimes it is so tired to see what the lector go by long way. Check this out, please http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html",4
89227,Good learning course,4
89239,Amazing course ...,4
89246,"Nice course, very good explanations.",4
89252,"it was a good Course and i learnt a lot of information from it , it gives you info about a lot of things that hard to find any where else",4
89268,"The pace increased, as well as the demand.",4
89270,"I like how this specialisation evolves... as in the previous block, it does not give you all details, but merely sets the direction. The homework assignments are quite good and, if executed properly, will teach you a lot.The only complaint - frequent ambiguity of multiple choice quiz questions.",4
89271,good approach for beginners,4
89274,"The course covered a lot of amazing things, but perhaps was too much too fast. I'm definitely not ready to move on to other things.",4
89278,"Simply great, I've learned Handlebars, a great tool to make my life easier programming instead of the use of jQuery all the time to fill DOM elements. It remains a little less difficult and probably a little more extension to cover all the details for beginner programmers people.",4
89282,"Information is provided in clear form, lecture are easy to follow. Would like to learn more information about events (had some problem with assignment) and have more freedom on last assignment (another database, purpose of the website)",4
89283,"It's a good course.If I must complain about something is that, since the course covers a little too much too fast, the people that is not familiar with the subject might not understand the why or how of things explained.",4
89286,"This is a great course to get to know how to build responsive websites. However, I think some basics were glossed over.",4
89288,"Great course, nice instructors ;)",4
89291,"Pace and content of the course is just nice. However, it would be good if more lecture slides were provided.",4
89295,Good introduction. Easy to follow.,4
89299,Dr Mick Grierson the best teacher in this course!,4
89302,Very practical.,4
89308,Interesting introduction with a good list of further reading material.,4
89312,"Very interesting course. I certainly learnt a lot about science and philosophy, especially relating it to religion, and the history behind each domain.",4
89316,That was a very great introductory course on philosophy...,4
89323,"Overall, the content was excellent. However, week 4 taught by Professor Conor Cunningham was rambling at best and made very little sense. The readings for week 4 were the only informative part.",4
89324,"Have really enjoyed this course, very informative and fascinating. Opened my mind to many different ideas.",4
89325,"The instructor during the last week was in general not very good, he always strayed from the point making it difficult to keep up. He gave examples that are mostly irrelevant, and he was too theatrical and not straight to the point.",4
89328,"I think this is an excellent introductory course to the philosophy of science. Even so, I felt something was lacking, maybe a sense of closure or a definite end to the course and indication of a clear path forward for those wanting to learn more about this topic. I would recommend this course in any case, I really enjoyed it.",4
89338,Good. i had learn a lot of things in this course. Thank you Coursera for providing this course.,4
89342,"It's unclear how complex your final project should be, and the elevator pitch and tech demo videos can be a bit daunting. But if you choose a project that's challenging and push through it, you can learn a lot.",4
89349,"Professor talks too fast. Maybe since it is not in English, I feel like that.",4
89350,"Well Done!It was my first mooc in Chinese, content was interesting, and example were useful (I liked the exemples with the dow jones).As I tried to follow using Python 3.6, I had difficulties with GUI compatibility and some evolution in SciPy",4
89357,"This is a really good course, comprehensive and useful to anyone wanting to know about quant methods. It's pretty tough and you need to study, but if you finish it you'll definitely learn a lot.",4
89372,"Useful and helpful course that is taught very well through the online lecture videos. However, think it needs to improve its help and guidance for students. I tried to get hold of the lecture organiser when the objective of the assignment was not clear and there was no-one that I could directly contact to ask a question and I was told on the live chat that my only option was to post my query on the forum - which nobody replied to. I think support should be more readily available from lectures rather than relying on other peers all the time who are sometimes just as confused.",4
89376,"Good content, good ideas, great examples. The forums were a little abandoned.",4
89379,Good course for those desiring to develop conception about research design. Students outside the purview of social sciences can find it a bit difficult.A few more examples in each module could perhaps be of further help. Overall an excellent course.,4
89381,"very good course, well structured!!",4
89382,"Very good and quality training : videos and material are in a very good quality. Assignments make well practice the acquired knowledge and the final exam reviews all lectures in a very practical way that allowed me to make the infinite connections until the end.The only negatively appreciated aspect is the issue to be graded when you submit your assignment few days later. Also, there is no real mentor from the university. These are very critical points that should really exist in a paid online course.",4
89392,"Nice Course, quite some views to digest but good for understanding how social research can/should be done/considered. Repetition required to grasp all these new terms if you are not a social science stu",4
89396,The lecture content covers the most basic concepts of quantitative research. It would be helpful to you if you have no experience in quantitative research before. But personally I think the lecturer covers too much on history--I had a hard time remembering the names.,4
89399,"Its great. So complete, you really gain an integral knowledge of the topic. I couldn't finish it because of the amount of homework.",4
89402,"I really felt this course was well presented and easily accessed for working learners. If you wish to build your skills in this area, this course is a good way to do it. My only hesitation regarding this course pertains to the time and energy spent on historical or largely theoretical constructs, such as what Plato thought or did not think about the nature of reality. To me, this should be an applied learning course given its nature and spending time and energy on this seems an academic exercise of little importance to the ability to understand research.",4
89412,Great use of examples. I was not thrilled with peer-reviews as some people may give you bad scores with no explanation and/or they may be wrong in their understanding/interpretation of the course material/assignment.,4
89414,"Good lectures, well-designed videos and tests. However, coordinators are low responsive. No extra reading is provided.",4
89415,it's really good for a student in planning department.,4
89416,It was a challenging course for someone that only knows quantitative research. Definitely took me more time than estimated (or proposed),4
89419,"Very good, easy to follow. Exams are well designed and offer a good training. Videos can sometimes be a bit boring to watch.",4
89423,"Very nice and interesting!I learnt a lot. I wish I could make better use of discussion forums. Some questions and few concepts remained unanswered/ not clear, however it was a fantastic experience overall.",4
89436,"Good pacing, good explanations, reasonable expectations.",4
89441,I loved working with this course. I am definitely going to graduate school based upon my achievement and enjoyment levels. Having a practical look at my potential new field has made me much more decisive about my path. Thank you!,4
89448,"This is my first MOOC and I enjoyed it. The lectures were clear, concise, and interesting. Most of the tests and assignments were relevant and well thought out.",4
89458,"Good Course. It should be complemented with reading of Neuman, Quantitative and Qualitative Methods in Social Science, which gives a far better overview of the contents of week 1 and 2 (insights into the scientific method). Nevertheless the rest of the weeks are very good and should provide a great framework of Quantitative methods for a undergraduate student, who can then complement this framework with some detailed additional readings, if it is of his liking. All in all, I really ended my fisrt college semester with an excellent knowledge in quantitative methods, for which I have to thank, in part to Miss Scholten for this wonderful course.",4
89460,"The material has a very good quality. The teacher explains the subject very well and the videos are very supportive. The build-up in the course is well-thought and works like a charm, I am excited to continue with the specialization.",4
89466,"I really enjoyed this course overall (and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already), but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments. It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors/teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues, especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people. But, I enjoyed the illustrations (drawings) and cute examples, and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera. I would probably give this course a 4.5 if possible, but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues. Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study.",4
89500,Great content and delivered in a clear way.,4
89502,Interesting and concise. Straight to the point.,4
89522,Nicely explained with easy to understand examples. Quite hard for those who have never studied research methods. Very dense information. I found one or two questions in the weekly quiz that I couldn`t answer with the knowledge available in the videos.,4
89544,"Thought provoking material, that enlarged by view of the field of photography.",4
89547,Its a great course to get bases in photography.,4
89549,"As a photography professional but not a fine art student, I found this course valuable in understanding the evolution of photography from its role in historic image capture to become a form of social observation and artistic interpretation and statement. Understanding the evolution of the photograph has made me more aware of what artists working in the photographic medium are trying to represent through their works.The course is not technical. It does not teach how to compose or develop a photograph. Rather, it is a lesson on the history of photography and using photography creatively through alternative and creative interpretation.",4
89555,"I enrolled the course expecting a little more vision on ""how to read"" a photograph, a composition, although thanks to the Curator I now understood that the context (time, environment, history, …) is important to that purpose.I appreciated the competence with which she treated each subject and the interesting perspective given to the various modules. It gave me a new viewpoint in what photography really is.Good videos and interviews made it easier to understand.Some readings from the required and additional resources were difficult because of the concepts.I personally found some topics (module 5 and 6) a bit abstract and difficult to follow, but I put myself into it to expand my knowledge and open my mind.",4
89563,"A very fine course and an interesting and stimulating learning experience. The materials were great - based as they were on the vast archival resources of MOMA's photographic department. These were deployed to provide a quality course. It was particularly interesting to be introduced to photographers and work with which I was previously unfamilar - 'Evidence' and 'Carnival Strippers' in particular spring to mind. My only quibble was with the forums - which were ok, but compared to other coursera courses seemed to lack the engagement of tutors to pose searching questions and provide quality feedback. For some reason the forums were a little flat and didn't appear to stimulate e a high level of engagement . Other than this quibble, though, a hugely enjoyable and worthwhile course. Thank You!",4
89566,I enjoyed this course a lot! I learnt about many artists I had not come across before. It was interesting to see photography used in different and novel ways by a variety of artists.,4
89567,"I would give this course 4 1/2 stars. The course material was very well organized and the examples provided were for the most part very topical. the weight of the peer review at the end of the course is too high. Your peers have roughly the same knowledge as you do when you submit your assignment. They are being asked to assign a value to your submission which is really coarse...as there are only 3 choices 1 a pass, 2 not quite and 3 a fail. Considering you have done all the course work and quizzes up to the end it seems quite arbitrary.On another note I would like to suggest a project which became a book. All too often today we view photographs in every moment of our lives but we are unaware of the the face of those creators and their iconic works. MoMA's course seems a perfect opportunity to somehow introduce the subject. the book is Behind Photographs - Archiving Photographic Legends by Tim Mantoani and MarkMurphy.BEHIND PHOTOGRAPHS: ARCHIVING PHOTOGRAPHIC LEGENDS began as the personal quest of photographer Tim Mantoani to document and preserve noted photographers together with their images. ""We have come to a point in history where we are losing both photographic recording mediums and iconic photographers,” Mantoani comments. ""While many people are familiar with iconic photographs, the general public has no idea of who created them. This book became a means to do that, the photographer and their photograph in one image.”",4
89573,"The course provides an in-depth immersion into the worlds of photography. Beyond the genuine interest of the different courses, the learning process itself is well thought with a good gradation and the ability to deep dive into a theme thanks to the complementary material proposed.",4
89592,Rather interesting. Challenged my perception of what photography is and could be.,4
89593,"A lot of study of artist's work, which makes you study the history of photography as well. The weekly thematics are good.",4
89594,A really amazing course full of excellent resources. Perfect for the inquisitive photographer.,4
89595,"Buen curso, sobre todo los recursos bibliográficos gratuitos.Nice course, the best part was the free library resources.",4
89599,Learned a lot of about Photography & Art and got direction on what I want to learn further.I wish the videos were longer. Uploaded text was formatted in to be easier to read online. The pages were multiple horizontally and text was small.,4
89616,"This is a good course on photography from an important institution that will show you and teach you the several aspects and topics of photography, from document to artwork. Made of six modules, each focused on a specific aspect, it provides different media to learn from, like interviews, critics and overviews, both in video and writings. All aspects are of photography are necessarily condensed and sometimes basic but many different links and suggestion on further material is given for those who want to get deeper. If you like photography, if you want to understand it better, or even if you are just curious about this medium which is today in everybody's lives, you will hardly be disappointed by this course. The only negative aspects for me were that sometimes the material was difficult to read and that sometimes subtitles were not very good, but this latter is a problem only if you are not an English motherlanguage. Instrucions on grading and final assignment aren't so easy and well them and this is a possible improvement for the organisation.",4
89623,"In my opinion this course is based in strong concepts and gives a good learning opportunity for those who want to understand the role of photography as a important medium. I have learned very much and, more than that, the course inspired me to keep learning by myself about the subject. I would suggest including other important names of photographers, who were/ or are key people in the history of the medium. In some way, I came out of the corse with the impression that American photography was really the focus. Photographers from other nationalities where in focus when related to US someway. I missed that the course would have a broader vision to offer about photographers that were/are relevant in that medium. Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa for instance were merely mentioned and Helmut Newton (maybe I missed), I didn't see him mentioned.My other suggestion is related to the quiz. Sometimes, the questions are focusing in aspects not really relevant of the theme of the week. There was a really relevant content and some questions would focus on for example the ""Edson Chagas distribute his work himself or not"" when his work has an important social impact to be called of the attention of the students. In the week 4, the content related to posed/unposed photography for example was not included in the quiz when it was a key part of the message of the week's theme. So, my point is to review the quiz, including content which is relevant and it might be out, and prepare the questions not necessarily focusing in aspects that are not really adding to the learning of the student.Please feel free to ask if having interest in discuss my opinion further.Jussara Nunes Pereira de Souzajussaranpsouza@outlook.com",4
89627,Amazing course! Interesting and very useful for who likes photography.,4
89628,"Great Course! A tiny ""but"": it's all about NYC...haha",4
89636,"The course is a good introduction on how to look at images from a different perspective. Good materials, highly enjoyable. The reading lists are pretty good, with interesting additional material.",4
89649,Great course to learn about the different visions and angles that photography has to offer,4
89653,"This Course does a really great job in opening new perspectives about photography.Each week stands for its own and yet they combine to give you a great understanding about photographies history, techniques and artistic value.What I did not like that much, was that pretty much reading was required and that there was so much detailed information about the museums history included. That is why I rate 4/5",4
89658,"A very good course, I learned a lot about new perspectives and history of photography",4
89660,I love it!,4
89662,Interesting insights in the history of photography and current way of how photos are seen.,4
89666,"Very interesting and rewarding course. It has developed a lot my knowledge concerning photography's history and its different uses. As a french speaker with a good english level, I still need to say some parts were a bit difficult to understand, mostly some of the reading assignments. But don't worry, it's possible to achieve it. You definitely won't regret to have taken this course if you have a (small) interest in photography!",4
89667,Great material and insights,4
89668,"Good, very interesting course",4
89669,"To me, Seeing through Photographs is a travel through time which let you to see how photography changed and improved to become what it is today: not only a science resource, or a way to save historical data but also it's a expressive way to comunicate a point of view. I recomend it to those who are starting to study photography or for once that loves art.",4
89674,"Thank you again... I really enjoyed the course! Great taster of modern & contemporary photography as well as artists who have made an impact on the craft. That said, I would love to have seen & learned more about the early photographic techniques, processes & images, i.e. Daguerreotypes, etc.",4
89675,Really interesting from beginning to end.,4
89681,"Great course. I have a few suggestions to make it even better:Pros:Videos on artists are just amazing, good quality and full of interesting information.Organization of the modules is wonderful, it makes a lot of sense.Optional readings are really interesting, it would be difficult for people like me from undeveloped countries, to get that kind of documentation from a prestigious museum.Doing exams is a good way to refresh all you read on the module.Expositors are well versed and interesting, kudos on that.The slides sections are well designed and the format is wonderful to read on either a computer or a cellphone.Cons:Better scans, some of them were difficult to read, pdfs should be formatted to fit a single page in full screen. Its almost impossible to read from a cellphone.Some of the multiple choice questions on the exams were just too much, all due respect, edX continuous examination works in a more efficient way.I hope MoMA do another interesting course on photography, perhaps specific subjects like landscape and street photography, and all the interesting subjects around them. I'm really glad to have found this, congratulations and thanks for putting this together.Carlos Moraritocs@gmail.com",4
89682,A really interesting course with great reading materials and videos designed specifically for its thematic weekly topics. I only wish it were longer!,4
89684,"This is a very interesting course that helps you to understand how an image can be read and interpreted. The focus is very much on the veracity of photography and on the decisioning process which goes through the process of taking pictures. I really enjoyed studying for this course. However, I would expect something more in terms of revision of the final assignment. I would expect some feedback also in order to understand if my reasonings were correct.",4
89692,"Perfect, really what I was looking for. Entering the photography world with a critic Eye and knowledge of what you are looking when you are looking a picture.",4
89696,"I found the course very interesting , useful materials to support and unique and original contributions video.Interviews with authors well made and full of new ideas on different topics.Excellent multiple choice for testing, but it is really hard to understand the mistakes made or know the correct answer after passing the module.",4
89697,"Very thorough, very nice, quite entertaining and interesting.As someone who has a lot of trouble remembering names I found the quizzes quite hard (I was not pursuing the certificate so I didn't care if I failed) but I understand that since the class and the goals are subjective while the evaluation has to be objective it matters that those questions can be unambiguous.All in all, I feel like I did learn to look at photographs differently, and to look at the world through photographs. I'll definitely recommend it to my friends!",4
89701,"Really enjoyed the diversity and range of photography shown, definitely a good introduction to the various movements that make up the medium and how they interact.",4
89707,Very accessible and informative. I wish there was more information on the issues and trends in photography and less on who said what. The first three modules are very interesting,4
89710,Excellent course. It gives me an insight history and views from how images have evolved from flim to digital eras.,4
89715,Very useful and interesting course. Thank you.,4
89718,very interesting materials!,4
89719,Quite good but only in english...,4
89722,Really enjoyed the content of this course. Exposes you to a variety of photographers and their personal styles.,4
89725,"Provides a good overview and appreciation of photographic images and their interpretation. The course material is well presented and easy to follow. There is a good range of extended reading provided, plus suggested further reading. The early course 'assessments' are a little bit odd in places, with very specific questions about a particular photography, that, in my opinion, do not add to the overall course experience, but overall its still worth it. If there was a more advanced follow on I'd be prepared to sign up.",4
89728,"A very interesting course. It is wonderful that there are many videos of photographers who explain their works themselves. I also liked the reading material: the compulsory material is of the appropriate length, of a good quality and interesting.",4
89731,A quick but full course about history of American photography,4
89732,It is not the best of ... but actually I was available to have some positive sentence about photography. Amazing,4
89733,Great videos and interviews with amazing photographers. They leverage very well MoMA's collection. I think the course design and lectures are not the best way to grasp the key concepts ann ideas.,4
89741,Well thought out course. I learned a lot.Some of the supplemental materials were extremely dense with professor-speak. I found my learning ground to a slow crawl from having to look up as many a 5 words in some sentences and I have a Masters Degree.In reading some of my peers essay submissions it seems that others may have had a similar difficulty with the material.,4
89748,"This course has been very interesting, however I believe that the mix of genre has been somewhat limited. While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists, I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance: picking up litter, photographing it, and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography, unless the artist's message is in documenting our 'throw-away' society and highlighting the importance of 'recycling' for the benefit of the environment. Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion. The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused. The interviewer(s) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist(s) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests. My argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent.",4
89750,I just watched the videos - but they were terrific and very illuminating. Thanks!,4
89759,"An interesting outtake to examine the world as other photographers and artist see the pictures presented, changing the way we see the world, our work and the work of others",4
89786,Great learning although it was more of self learning. I would rather encourage the institute to develop support system for the trainees as many a time one feels helpless when a question in the quizzes are not understood. The current system that is accessing the forum was not quite beneficial if I may be permitted to mention. Thanks and regards..,4
89787,very good course for intermediate and professionals,4
89792,Good course,4
89793,Good concept coverage. Paced at a comfortable rate and good examples worked out for practice,4
89794,In my opinion that this course can help any one that want to know about the financing and diversification ..,4
89798,I enjoy the lectures and problems. If you put the time in and interact with people on the discussion boards it really helps. However I can't give it 5 stars because if you are stuck on a problem you can't sit down and talk to someone about how to conquer it. A great deal of time can be wasted working on a problem the wrong way because teachers or assistants aren't available for lengthy discussions. Especially after the course. There are problems that we never figured out and there should be a way to see the proper path to success and enlightenment us for the time and effort that was put into the course.,4
89800,"Great course. I was challenged and wanted to give up, but the Professor's enthusiasm kept me motivated. I am glad I persevered.",4
89804,"Great content!Complementary reference has to be bought separately or researched on the web, which can be misleading.",4
89815,I took this course mainly to teach my daughter and to review what I already learned years ago. Teaching style is good and assignments are reasonable. I encourage new programmers to take this course.,4
89817,"After submitting the assignments and getting score,it will be better if Coursera provides the solution of those assignments.By this,students will get benefit form this that what mistakes they did and how will it will be corrected in future.",4
89825,the code shown in the video was not clear enough in some modules. Topics were explained in easy and understandable manner,4
89827,"It would be better if the instructor could talk about the difference/advantages/disadvantages vs other languages, and what fields are python most useful over other languages.",4
89835,it was short and concise python learning tutorials and i enjoyed it fully.thank you coursera,4
89836,"This was a good solid intro course. Got a good working understanding of the Python program basics out of this. He taught less about programming basics (ie not a completely intro computing class) than another Python course I tried, which is what I wanted. Probably wouldn't be the class to recommend if this is your first programming class. Work/time expectations were as listed.",4
89837,The course is interesting and good for developer to learn python.,4
89839,Nice Basic course with enough explanations. The video quality was not good and text in video was barely visible.,4
89845,The course is is targeting total beginners in programming. The material is very basic and much topics are not even touched.,4
89848,Makes a lot of sense,4
89849,A good introductory course to programming in python,4
89856,"Great introductory course. Slightly on the light side for developers looking to learn a new language, but absolutely perfect for non developers looking to learn basic programming skills.Well done guys!",4
89859,good introduction to python,4
89866,"This is a very good starter course, and it covers most of the things a beginner would need. The exercise were great, and so was the assignments graded by the auto-grader. There were one or two questions that proposed outputs wasn't what the auto-grader wanted, but you will figure it out when you get there. Great course.",4
89869,Great introduction to the Python programming language. Although the assignment marking seems a little rigid and tends to mark you down despite written functions achieving the expected outcomes.,4
89870,Absolute beginner's course. Quick and easy overview of the absolute basic features in Python. 4/5,4
89871,A very handy course to get a good start with Python programming language. It is positioned well for the beginner audience.,4
89875,Good introduction on Python.,4
89877,A very good course for starting with python. If you already know something about programming this is perfect for starting knowing how wonderful is python.,4
89881,"A little too concise, but good advanced topics if you already had a basic Python course.",4
89887,"Nice introduction to Python, very easy for beginners. It would be nice to include more discussions on why certain data types are desirable and how they can be exploited.",4
89888,"Good intro, but not explaining many important principles, like variable scope, for example",4
89890,Covers the basics very well. Very good introductory course.,4
89894,"Great course, although week 4 seems awfully short and lacking in practice.",4
89897,"Ideal to get the basic python concepts, the grade exercises are fair with a proper skill level.",4
89898,The videos could have been more explanatory.,4
89901,"I know it is a lot asked, but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic. Also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier: please do not use loud keyboard when making videos, and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being written.Thanks, Janis",4
89903,A really good and informative beginner course.,4
89910,Very useful introduction,4
89911,Simple but useful. But not suitable for those who have used python,4
89917,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more.I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture.I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week.This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.Thumbs up Prof. Boyd and crew!!,4
89923,Good introduction to the Python programming language which covers Python 3. The assignments could have been slightly more challenging.,4
89925,An straightforward introduction to python with useful exercises and examples.,4
89927,Grate class for any beginner with no programming background or Python knowledge. Helped me to understand key basic concepts. Will be nice if you guys provide more exercises to practice and tougher questions.,4
89928,"Pretty good for a beginners course, but there were some things that could have been explained more clearly..",4
89932,"This course give me a good start for python, thanks.",4
89935,This was a nice but easy course for one having basic knowledge of Python. Liked the way of taking assignments. Thanks to the instructor Bill Boyd sir ..,4
89938,Found it a tad too basic (I'm a professional C++/Java programmer). But an excellent introduction to python. I must particularly mention the fluidity of the course embraces the spirit of the Python language.,4
89941,"Very good for people who just started out programming. The class gives you a chance to practice logic flow while programming. However, if you have done a little programming before, the class is too easy.",4
89943,"The course is pretty good, but not mobile friendly course since the font size becomes way too small for visibility. Hence learning is not possible while travelling by train / car to utilize unproductive time.Otherwise, content-wise it is pretty good.",4
89946,Very straight forward course with easy to follow instructions. The autograder takes some getting used to. Make sure there are no additional lines at the end of your code and make sure everything is precisely copied for your output.,4
89949,The course was easy to understand. but i find the slides not much of help.,4
89958,I love the course's content but discussions are of poor quality and the honors tracks assignments are a little messy. I ought having more explanation about the tool to use or maybe doing the programming assignments in another tool/language than Lenskit even it seems like a decent project.,4
89959,I think this is a good course to start exploring recommendation systems.,4
89964,"The course authors did a great job explaining concepts related to recommender systems. However, the programming assignments require Java usage, even though they could easily allow people to use different software, by just explaining the required algorithm and accepting a csv file with orderings/predictions. That was quite disappointing.",4
89965,More information on Programming Assignment would have been helpful . Overall a good course to begin the specialization,4
89966,Too theoretical. I hope other parts will have more details.,4
89970,Auto-grading would have been a better option in this course.,4
89984,"Course is great but I'd prefer that the tasks required writing code or editing the given code to complete the task it'll help more, but over all course was great.",4
89987,I still think that there is a lot to learn. the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to.If I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better.generally the course is very good for beginners. The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning.,4
89993,"Although it does not contain new content, it puts all the content from the specialization together. It could be more challenging.",4
89994,A nice way to sum it all up and see the potential.,4
90006,"This is an excellent introductory course to computer programming. It gives you all the opportunities to learn at your own pace.It is not too difficult to clear the capstone itself, but the course gives you the opportunity to chose your own project which makes it all the more interesting.",4
90009,This course is made so that you create something on your own if you just want to pass the assignments then the course won't be a challenge but if the projects are interesting to you and you want to do something creative then you have the right course .,4
90012,"It was a very good course. However I would like we were need to code a little bit more. I know it´s up to us how much we do and how difficult we do our task, but I would be nice if we had to write a bit more on the assignments.",4
90021,"Very good course, though a bit less challenging than I have expected. A true capping of the previous courses.",4
90024,"The sample solution and explanations are very good since it gives a complete whole picture of doing a big data analysis project. The assignment is very easy, but good to get the specialization.",4
90030,This projects in this course tested all the knowledge that i had acquired before. The projects were challenging enough and well prepared.,4
90050,"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run.",4
90055,Coursework was quite easy. Used a lot of the techniques learned in the other courses. You'll get the most out of this course if you have a data analysis project that you want to do. For us this wasn't required. But doing my own project was the most fun part :),4
90057,Many thanks to Professor Chuck that put so much effort on this course.,4
90064,I wish it was more hands on.,4
90080,Too easy. :),4
90081,"I enjoyed the course but mostly only because I had ample time to complete it. I likely wouldn't have finished if I was busier. The course notes aren't particularly helpful and they are very brief. The assignments were just okay but most of the time spent on them was trying to debug the code rather than learn the concepts studied in the lectures. I'm giving this course 4 stars, not because the Coursera content was good, it wasn't, but rather because I learned a lot trying to 'figure out' the assignments and finding information online. I'd say if you're a beginner, looking to step into robotics, it might be worth your time but if you're intermediate to advanced, you ought to move along. The content taught versus the time it takes to debug the codes might not be worth your effort.",4
90086,assignment grading feedback can be made better.,4
90087,"Great Introductory Course. It is a bit short on course content, but teaches you enough to be able to learn from other sources such as research papers, etc.",4
90088,A good course that gives you a brief info on various motion planning methods. A bit more techniques as well as a more complex assignments couldve been put together so that we could understand and implement better.,4
90089,"Very good introduction to motion planning algorithms. The exercises are a bit simple, their descriptions could be more detailed and with more examples and implementations. The grading of some exercises (specially the 4th) is a bit tricky, knowing more about the evaluation conditions would help. Very good course overall, totally recommended!",4
90090,"Great course overall. The automatic grader may not be perfect, but the TA is constantly working on it and he has been clearing up confusion by posting updated PDFs and codes. The discussion forum is awesome. There is plenty of presence of the TA and classmates.It is true that the lectures aren't as long as Aerial Robotics, but they are concise and clear enough for us to work on the assignments. If you are good at matlab and programming, you can breeze through the assignments. If not, you can get stuck for days, like I did.",4
90092,Could be improved. There is more need of involvement of mentors and TAs.,4
90093,"A lot of things to learn,but the programming assignment evaluate program does not help in finding mistakes.",4
90103,"A good and interesting course to get a fundamental understanding of how robots move. Not easy, but quite rewarding for the one who is willing to put some efforts into it.",4
90109,Good Introductory Course but can be better.,4
90111,Good but can do better.,4
90112,"the fundamental of planning algorithm, basic algorithm: Dijkstra, A*, RRT, artificial potential. Some exercises' requirement should be more detail.",4
90119,"it's a nice to learn a lot from the course. Some of the assignment is quite difficult. But with the discussion forum's help, I can pass all of them.",4
90122,The last part is a bit boring.Overall I like this course a lot! Thanks!,4
90123,I learned a lot of brilliant techniques in this course. Thank you.,4
90130,Great class. For those with lots of programming experience this course is a little too easy.,4
90131,"It's nice! I particularly like the programming homework. However, the course is pretty much beginner-level, and the course is too short (for only 4 weeks).",4
90134,It is only introductory course. not a lot of content.,4
90139,Great course! I'm really enjoy it. Thanks a lot professor CJ Taylor and staff.,4
90140,"Great course, but I found some problems in assignments formulation and also it would be great if some supplementary material was proposed in order to connect this subject with courses, it might seem sometimes disconnected.",4
90143,"The videos are short and to the point, and the Matlab home works are great.",4
90147,Taught me many planning algorithms in an easy way.,4
90153,"Assignments were fantastic, course structure was great! Focus was mainly on algorithmic concepts that were then implemented during assignments. Great learning experience. Just that the assignment grading system could have been better.",4
90154,It was a great course!!!,4
90157,Should letting us do more programming stuff.,4
90159,"A great course on Motion Planning for systems, I enjoyed it. I got stuck a few times during assignments, but due to a great community, I was able to pull through and gain a better understand of the course.",4
90161,"some of the assignments are unclear, need more detail. Over all great course.",4
90164,"In this course we will get to know about shortest path algorithm such A*, Dijkstra's, concept of configuration space and path planning in the same, developing Probabilistic road maps and RRT and also a bit about Artificial potenial fields. All the algorithms are neatly explained. The material though very short(in terms of total hours of video lectures) is nicely compiled. The quality of the MATLAB exercises is very good with few issues here and there. We can extract a lot about MATLAB implementation of different simulations by spending time understanding the given code and also implementing missing sections as part of the assignment.Overall, a great course.",4
90175,"as an introduction is a really good course. The assignments are interesting and can get you to understand what you are doing.However, the grading system used for the assignment is frustrating.. it is never known what it is actually graded and even if your solution is correct compared to what written in the assignment pdf, most of the times is considered wrong without saying why.",4
90181,"I enjoyed this course, and learnt a lot. The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 is that the programming assignments were a bit too easy, especially the last two.",4
90184,Damn good!! and bit difficult,4
90201,Good course. Useful for research students.,4
90202,This is a thorough course on Questionnaire Design. I have found it very rewarding for those who are interested in research knowledge. After completing this part of the course I am left wanting to attempt at least some of the other parts particularly those dealing with data analysis and hopefully learn about soft ware that might be available as an aid to data analysis. I recommend the course to those who desire to approach their research assignments in a more scientific way.By way of a general comment I would suggest that course material and examples be as internationally representative as possible. some of the presentations assume that participants understand the American social developments and the research preoccupations.,4
90208,"It would be very useful for teachers, teacher-trainers etc. They must go for this course.",4
90209,Could be more practical.,4
90210,Great course understand research method and design!,4
90213,Very useful.,4
90214,A well thought course on the composition of items. The main strength is that it is supported both by the expertise of the speakers and academic literature.,4
90217,"Pros: Excellent material, great that slides are available for downloadCons: The videos are much too long and have too much detail that could just be added as footnotes in the slides.",4
90225,"Very helpful. But could be more interactive, more activities to do. Maybe include peer assessed tasks where we can create good questionnaire items by each topic. Lecturers are like frozen - no or very little emotions.",4
90233,"The material is a bit dry, but it's essential to writing effective survey questions. The course is well designed and easy to follow. Thanks to the University of Michigan and the University of Maryland for offering this interesting course. I hope to see additional offerings in survey research methods from these professors in the future.",4
90236,"very informative course, covers several aspects of questionnaires. Many examples are provided although references are a bit old but i suppose that they are seminal research works.",4
90240,Great course. The instructors could have gone a bit slow during the session on multiple regression.,4
90245,This is a great beginner level course for those have no programming experience. But I would suggest the content to be extended to 8 weeks instead of 4 weeks.,4
90248,Assignmetns allow student to choose dataset and analysis - but are not very well structured.Detailed exaplanations.,4
90249,great effort was paid preparing this course .,4
90250,simple and useful,4
90252,Good Course. To the point and clean lectures.,4
90260,Good for understanding concepts and running code in SAS but still needs more depth to the coursework.,4
90265,I truly enjoyed this course and I learned a lot. I particularly liked the structure and setup. My suggestions for improvement would be to provide more background information and further reading on the subjects covered and to maybe have a handout that summarizes the most important concepts and key messages of each week.,4
90268,"This was another strong course from Wesleyan, and well produced. However some of the weekly problems were vague and it was not clear exactly what was being sought or how they would be evaluated, as they have been very clear in the previous mini courses in this specialization.",4
90273,"The videos are sometimes interesting, but explanations would have been clearer if there are documents provided as visual aids.",4
90274,"A very good course in general. The materials and assignments are practical and the explanation of the instructors are clear. You are expect to gain a general knowledge about computer vision, camera calibration, and the usage of linear algebra in computer vision.One thing that could be improved is that there is a big jump from week 2 to week 3 and also from week 3 to week 4. It's like a sophomore course at week 1 and week 2 and suddenly it jumps to a senior course in week 3 and a graduate course in week 4. It might be better to provide some supplementary materials in between.",4
90276,"Loved the lecture and materials. However, the course need more ACTIVE teaching staff and mentors. I had several questions regarding the materials but could not get any help from start to the end. It was the only specialization course that I had to move on without complete understanding of the materials.",4
90278,The 4th week content is hard to follow than the previous three. It would be better if more detailed math and examples are provided in the 4th week.,4
90279,Unclear explaination,4
90285,"Lots of good content, good explanations, and good pictures to explain things. I enjoyed the assignments too",4
90289,"very informative. the course is very demanding, due to very long lectures it is hard to stay in pace.",4
90290,"The course has a good structure. It covers interesting themas. The assignments are easy to understand. It takes more effort than 3 or 5 hours/week, the nomenclatur could be improved to be consistent. A couple of more examples would improve learning. The four week was hard ;)",4
90292,The courses are good and helpful.,4
90293,"Good course, but assignmets are too long, difficult and with no much help. Workload is overpassed",4
90298,"This course is great! There is a lot of information available, a wide range of topics are covered, some complex subjects are explained quite well and especially the Chinese professor makes it easy to understand them.Still, there is room for improvement. Considering this is a 4-week course and the coverage of the material, sometimes it feels too squeezed and cramped together. This could be improved by providing access to more references to other materials to complement the studies. A bibliography for instance would be much welcome.Also there are some annoying typos in the slides in the formulas and its derivations that can cost you some precious time to figure out, especially during the Matlab assignments.These are the only reasons I don't give this course 5 stars, but it's definitely worthwhile. You will not regret it!",4
90303,The lecture notes should be better organized.,4
90314,"This course has a lot of interesting material regarding perception using cameras. The lectures focus on a wide range of topics, from the basics until camera pose estimation, epipolar geometry, optical flow and 3D motion. The explanations are very clear, and the Jacobian explanation using colors is excellent.Negative points: sometimes the lectures are long, and the concepts are a little bit mixed.",4
90325,Good tips provided to make sure nothing has been forgotten in your research process.,4
90336,its Resource full and informative,4
90339,"The course is much better than my expectation, and the flexibility in the quiz and deadline is much supportive. The content of the course is widely sourced. One should do this whoever want to the the evolution of the advertisement world.",4
90341,"it's helpful but not interactive a lot, sometimes hard to follow the video but the proffessor is quite knowledged about the history, gives a lot of insights and force you to re-assess the course after it finishes , by na",4
90345,Takes you back to the age old version of ad pieces from cave paintings to todays social madness. A complete guide to a better student of advertising. And the 80% cross mark challenging and motivating. Thanks for this.,4
90351,"Pretty good course, although could have been a bit more exhaustive",4
90361,"Very good, but I wish for more analysis of what self-destructive metrics mean and how to handle them (who own the metric, etc)",4
90363,"Good material, but even better external material shown by links to blogs or related stuff.Too focused in SCRUM. Maybe other methodologies are worth to explain.I'll not buy it since I'm a SM, but if you are beginning with this topics or want to pursue a SM certificate, this course definitively can help you.",4
90366,"Metrics produced a great opportunity to use exercises creating the software metric artifacts, as was done so well in course #4. This would be a significant improvement, and the lack of it was the only reason this didn't get five stars.",4
90368,Great course to learn all about tracking progress in your software project,4
90373,This is a great course for leading the development team but it's very theoretical.It is better to add videos from real-world meetings.,4
90374,Maybe it would be better to add more exercises to assimilate better the content. Same as previous courses in the Specialization.,4
90378,Good Course.,4
90386,Very nice content and presented so nicely. Must read and highly recommended course for all managers and business analysts.,4
90394,good course,4
90395,Great course! Starting to put pieces from earlier courses together into a whole.,4
90400,The course is very informative.,4
90401,"If you are at university (PhD student, academic, researcher, etc.) then you kind of know most of the ""theory"". However, practising R was a huge plus (personally, I liked the Week 4 task).",4
90402,"decent course, it is as long as you make it but start the final project early",4
90408,"Thank you, my teacher",4
90410,I think it is one of the easiest and most important courses in Data science.,4
90413,Good course. Especially enjoyed final course project. It's really challenging and looks like a real‑life task.,4
90415,"I have learned a lot in this course, for me more important than any tool or technical skill it was the idea of reproducible research, which can be used in many other process. Anyone who has been in a deputy position or replacing someone else at work can easily understand the importance of making things reproducible.",4
90419,Good course as part of the data science specialization. Much effort needed for assignments in contrast to this relative light topic.,4
90421,"While I'm pretty sure this course is VERY important for researchers, it is not very useful for my area (IT) and I would like to know this before taking the course. Thank you.",4
90426,Could have more content in deep,4
90428,"The concept is very important, so it's good that this course is available. The video's are sometimes not that great of quality. It's okay to show recordings of lectures, but the sound is of less quality.Another thing is that the teacher says a lot of ""euhm"". I know he cannot help that, but once you notice this it becomes a bit annoying.",4
90432,latex is better :O,4
90433,All in all a great course with very valuable information to make a data scientist better at his job. However it could have been covered in 2 weeks time,4
90437,You will learn how to use a very valuable tool in this class; its name is R Markdown. Besides Prof. Peng explains very well the importance of reproducible research. Nice course!,4
90441,Very good course. Would love to get to see examples of some advanced usage of knitr in developing presentations and complex reports.,4
90442,quite redondant with what was done before but very usefull and clear course,4
90444,"Besides the ""real"" scientists like medicine or bioscience, I think the whole community would be better off it everybody would follow the principles laid out here: Do your analysis but make sure that others can follow the rationale and that your steps are documented and thus reproducible.",4
90470,It is about how to make your work available for others and yourself in the future. It is quite refreshing because I have never heard about anything in this course from anywhere else. It is useful for me and hope it will be useful to you.,4
90471,Could have been covered in 1-2 weeks.,4
90473,"Very useful material, and great use for presenting data analysis results.",4
90474,Some of the material seems pretty rote but it did introduce some new software and capabilities.,4
90477,Material was very interesting and I learned a lot,4
90483,"Pretty good course that introduces a lot of useful tools and the concept of reproduciblity. However, it is not quite as applicable as the previous courses for those who are individual contributors in the private sector and rarely have others double check their analyses or need to publish anything.",4
90484,Good but not that deep. This should be in 2 weeks.,4
90485,"The course already needs and actualization, plus they must fix the order of the first assignment. Besides that, this is a really useful and fulfilling course.",4
90494,Great course. Learn new amazing stuff.,4
90496,"This was another very useful course in the series, with (peer reviewed) assignments taking on a very significant role.",4
90499,Rather general topic,4
90501,it shows how to better communicate one analysis and i have learnt a lot from it. the lectures should be updated as some details and figures were irrelevant a this time,4
90507,This would be very effective for my personal skill enhancement.,4
90513,"Very good, but maybe not at solid as those before it. Some reproducibility concepts felt a bit vague.",4
90516,Week1 and Week2 should be swapped I guess.,4
90520,Overall I found this course useful. My only complaint is that the material needed to complete the first assignment in week 1 came in week 2.,4
90528,The first assignment should occur during the second week instead of the first given how the material is presented. The second and final project is very time consuming. Ideally this course should run for 6 weeks instead of 4 because of this. The second project is challenging and it definitely drives home the point about reproducible result given the state of the raw data.,4
90535,"By far the most time consuming, yet rewarding course in the data science specialization thus far. Literate Programing in general and R Markdown in particular are simple enough as concepts, but do take some time to grow accustomed to. However, I found the course to be a compelling argument for reproducibility that has application beyond just Data Science proper.Although the technology is completely different, the concepts behind reproducibility really resonated with me and the work I do managing a division in Application Development. I'm constantly having to balance seemingly limitless demands, limited resources, and the difficulty of retaining staff in highly-competitive industry. Reproducibility becomes not just the basis for cross-training, product stabilization, and growth, but is a necessary ingredient of a team's survival.This course not only cemented my own thoughts on the topic, but gave me some new ideas and tools for process improvement on the job.",4
90543,Good to know the principles here. Thanks.,4
90545,"In this course, there was a slide presentation with audio recorded in a classroom. This part of the course should be replaced as soon as possible to offer better experience. As it is presented right now, with a loudy environment, it really doesn't match to the quality of the other courses.",4
90547,Still i can used easily.,4
90556,"Great class with excellent supporting material. A little chaotic, but very good overall.",4
90557,First week has an assignment that requires knowledge from the second week. It would be better for the course if both assignments has two weeks for accomplishment.,4
90565,Covers some important and interesting areas and is generally well taught (although the recording quality on the videos varies). Interesting final project!,4
90566,"Compact, informative and practical",4
90573,"A good MOOC, but i was also hoping to see how to make solid lectures for class.",4
90574,They cover the three tips well and use classroom footage to demonstrate the points. (It would be nice if the classrooms didn't look staged though.),4
90575,"Even if you're a rookie teacher, the course turns you into a student first! Excellent material and teaching, but it seems specially geared toward K-12.",4
90576,I love this course and the way the insights are presented. Thank you.,4
90595,Pretty practical course It' ll involve a good amount of programming. Not quiz and theoretical verification here.,4
90604,"Everything is good,but the assignments are a little hard,haha",4
90606,"Week 1 and Week 3 are organized much better than Week 2 and Week 4. If you don't have enough time, I recommend that you focus on Week 1 and 3.",4
90607,it was a good course,4
90611,"more mathematical depth would be great, videos are too concise",4
90617,"Lesson 1 and Lesson 3 are clear. However, homework in Lesson 2 and Lesson 4 is hard to finish because of too few materials in the lesson. Overall, it is a fairly good course.",4
90624,"Great content but dome speakers really need to be more involved... Some videos are perfect if you want to sleep...Also there was some mistakes in the programming assignments (more or less fixed now) and maybe a bit more details or example code would help. It was hard to make the assignments without extra help and many students had difficulties finding what to do, hopefully the forum was a real life saving tool.The MATLAB introduction is just ridiculous: you'll need 10x more knowledge of it to do the assignments. it's like taking your first driving lesson on Monday and do Indianapolis 500 on Tuesday...For someone like me that was not very familiar with this tool, I spend 90% of the time googling ""matlab doing this or that"" to find example code and making the code work instead of working on the algorithm itself.The tutorial in the Aerial Robotics is more complete.",4
90629,Good intro to Kalman filters.,4
90651,Great way to know about the reproductive system,4
90653,"Good as a very simple overview. This is more high school level than college level... but if that is what you are looking for, then worth the small investment of time and effort it will take.",4
90654,It's a good course. Provides some very important information about reproductive health. Young adolescent men and women should take this course before beginning their sexual life.,4
90663,it gives a nice and lovely topics that shoud be known by every coubles and partners to start a healthy family,4
90671,Great delivery!,4
90682,There is a glitch in the week 2 quiz but otherwise I am very much enjoying the course.,4
90688,"I learned a lot. This is a tough course, quizes are not trivial and the last HW was a huge amount of work. The videos are excellent. The professor goes slow, the visual aides are great and there are several impressive videos of drones doing impressive cool stuff. Only downside is that I would say it's harder than advertised. Also, there are some red herrings disguised as hints in the HW write ups that you have to be careful of before going down unnecessary rabbit holes.",4
90691,"Very well prepared, clear lectures and doable assignments which are the same time challenging.The only minus is that it is too hard, if possible, to contact the TAs.",4
90694,Great course. Brilliant for introduction to the field of aerial robotics and helpful for learning about use and application of drones.,4
90697,it is so awesome course,4
90698,"The material is very informative and generally well presented. I would have liked more video explanation about the minimum snap trajectories as this was a large part of the final assignment.If the Matlab resource was an actual desktop application instead of online, the assignments would have been much easier and quicker to accomplish. Matlab online, in my experience, is slow and hard to work with in a single browser window.Overall, I enjoyed this course.",4
90700,"The course was very useful, but the study material had several printing mistakes in formulae/ derivations that caused problems for some learners. Luckily there were more experienced people around to help, but the course organisers should be more careful in their material. Also, it would help if free software like octave is used rather than matlab.....it was a nightmare to download and install on my ubuntu computer and i still get annoying telephone calls from matlab people asking me if i'm interested in buying the full version.",4
90711,"It is very beneficial, but i just feel it could be a little more specific",4
90712,"It is a great course for me. At the end of the course, I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation.As opposed to the stated prerequisite, I believe the course requires engineering/math/physics background.On the down side, there is no TA presence in the discussion forum. You will need to rely on your classmates if you are stuck. Also the second assignment requires hours of tuning, which serves almost no educational purpose.",4
90715,Good as a basic course. The MATLAB visualizations help newer entrants to the field.,4
90728,"It's my first course in coursera. Aerial Robotics is a great course for me to learn more about quadrotor control. Some tools in matlab are very useful to help me deeply understand the material of the course. Unfortunately, formula or model of control have not explained yet. I hope, formula of model of the control can be explained, even it need external source or refer to some books. :)",4
90732,Really Helpful. The way they've explained stuff with such ease makes it totally worth it.,4
90735,Final Assignment was very unclear,4
90739,Took me more than initial 4 weeks to finish the course. The classmates discussion forum is really helpful. The moderators however are very silent. Not giving enough feedbacks and help most of the time.,4
90745,Very nice introductory course on aerial robotics.,4
90746,Very interesting! I really recommend. I don't agree with people who says it's only PD tunning. It entails comprehensions of physics and control.,4
90747,"Good contents! However, the lectures are long and a bit rushed. This course is definitely not for everyone! Assignment for week 3 definitely need an extra lecture to explain to do PID tuning.",4
90749,"This course is quite tough, and I often thought to myself: ""If this is an intermediate level, what does a professional level look like?"" Especially the later assignments are quite difficult and time consuming to solve (it says, you need approximately three hours to solve the last one. Well, it took me about 30 hours to come up with a half-decent attempt).However: if you really want to learn something new about cool flying robots (and who doesn't?) and are willing to spend quite an amount of effort and time, this is the course for you!",4
90759,"Great class with lots of wonderful information!I just wish the homeworks were less of a tedious exercise of controller tuning and more about implementing theory. Other than that, great course!",4
90761,"The only thing I think that put this course on the back foot is the absence of mentors and TAs. They should be pretty active enough to clear the doubts that pops up while clearing quizzes or programming assignments. Its just the people on the forum that comes handy but even when they are not sure about the concept then the going becomes tough. Apart from that, the course is one of the best of its kind and trust me you will never regret doing this certification !!! Good job team UPenn !!!",4
90766,It is very useful for design engineers.....but have maths as pre requiste,4
90779,"I really enjoyed this course and it really hooked me onto this topic, definitely this will not be the last robotics course I am going to follow. That being said there are some points of improvement.The main parts necessary to program the simulation assignments are covered in the materials, but there are still some of them that need to be pursued independently. Some assumptions have to be made that are not so obvious, I do not know whether it is the intention of this course to do so or not, but since they are minor footnotes that may hinder completely your results, I think they should be made explicit.The Matlab files available for the course work as intended, what is not so obvious though is how they are intended to work, that is because there is very little documentation about them, it would be great if there was more documentation available, especially for people who have never used such tools before.Finally, even though I personally enjoyed this course and I think it had an achievable level of challenge for me, I would definitely not recommend this course for total beginners, or people who do not have followed a math, physics or engineering degrees. The way the course is laid out, even if you do not understand the concepts behind each topic you will still manage to answer the quizzes and get the simulations to work eventually, however to truly understand what they mean and be able to replicate them in other environments requires some prior knowledge that cannot be taught in just a few hours.",4
90787,"Not for the faint of heart as you are expected to be (somewhat) up-to-date on derivatives and primitives for position, velocity, and acceleration. However, even with a minimum background in mathematics and a healthy dose of determination it is possible to succeed in this course. Do not expect it to be easy but really worthwhile if one is interested in quadrotors and ""what makes them fly"".",4
90790,Enjoyed the course. It was a good introduction. There is a good room for improvement though:1- More time should be spent on 3D quadrotor control2- Trajectory planning was not completely explained; importantly 2d and 3d need a lot more attention with focus on solving for minimum snap trajectory3- TA support was almost unavailable. TAs should be active during the course,4
90793,"Really fascinating material and loads of good information in the lectures. The homework assignments were satisfying if you can complete them, but unfortunately involved a lot of tedious trial and error. This was especially difficult since running the program can be slow which causes slow iteration of trial and error. I would not have been able to complete the assignments without helpful information in the course discussions.",4
90795,Excellent course. Highly recommended.The mathematical notations are sometimes confusing.,4
90796,"Great course! I like that there was lots of material for things that I might have not studied before but were necessary for the course.Assignments :I understand that getting people to tune PID manually gets them to understand things better, but cmon, not every single coursework!",4
90799,The course is theoretically great but i think it needs some more focus on the coding of path plannes taught theoretically.,4
90800,"I thought the course was very laid out in going from an overview towards more specific and harder material. For the most part, I thought the assignments were very good and did a thorough job of teaching feedback control. My only problem with the assignments were that they seem to overemphasize a trial and error approach for tuning the k gains. This became very tedious especially on the third assignment where the simulator ran so slowly.",4
90804,This part was good but it would have been much more informative if bit more is added.,4
90806,"IT is a brief course regarding Robotics, but adequate. It leave lots of room to understand. But provide enough to dig deeper into the Areal robotics. I am able to grasp the course work and work along with the pace set by instructor. All in all it was a good 5 weeks worth of lecture and hands on to simulations.",4
90811,"Really testing course. Get's pretty tricky, especially the final assignment.The staff is really helpful and the content is top-notch.",4
90814,"Great, but needs more material to fill in the gaps. Could do with a little more on the advanced topics like trajectory generation. Definitely needs more motivational examples. Videos of the lab and demonstrations of the research relevant to this course (done by the course provider) would be great.",4
90817,"A very good course, expecially for the MATLAB part. They can improve with more assignment in MATLAB and with some more theoretical stuff, like more types of trajectories, more types of controllers and so on. However, is one of the best course that I attended online in a few years. I absolutely recommend it.",4
90825,"I found this course to be stimulating and challenging. The coursework is much more difficult than the prerequisites would have you believe. I found myself dusting off my old linear algebra texts and matrix math notes. In the end, I worked through it, but it was a struggle.",4
90831,"A good overview on various fields of Robotics, especially control. Quizzes seemed a little ambiguous but lectures and assignments were very informative!",4
90833,"This is a very nice class about the aerial robotics. If the more background materials about the quadrotor are provied in the class content, the class will be better.",4
90837,it's need more explanation and specific resources,4
90838,"Excellent course, good planned and good use of online resources. Some things that could be improved are: encouraging students to implementation using hardware, not only simulations, and also there is a lot of material in the course that is rapidly reviewed, some more time could be invested into this.",4
90841,"I enjoyed the writeups as their explained system modelling very well. The first two assignments are a bit lacking in terms of what they teach, I believe one should instead handle the generation of the quad rotor system model and the other should teach control with the final teaching traj generation.",4
90847,Mind Blowing course...!!!,4
90849,Very nice course but at the end everything was just thrown at you to figure out on your own,4
90853,"I really enjoyed this course and felt the material was appropriate in scope and quality for an introduction to Aerial Robotics. I have a few issues with it though.While this wasn't a problem for me, I feel those who haven't done maths with vectors and matrices before would struggle with the maths presented here.There was some inconsistency in notation throughout the lectures - though I expect this will be fixed in future runs of this course.Given how much the programming assignments involved tuning PD controllers, I think there should have been some additional material provided on how to go about doing this.The difficulty of the last programming assignment came out of nowhere and given that you need to pass all the assignments in order to pass the course, this made it especially stressful. Having gotten almost full marks on the course until that point, the prospect of that all being for naught because I couldn't complete the final assignment in time was incredibly stressful and unfair. The simulation would fail with a Matlab ode45 error - with absolutely no information as to why that should fail. Trying to debug something by guesswork on a time limit is not a valuable educational experience.I feel all of these issues are fixable though and on balance I think this was a very good course.",4
90855,Overall the information provided in the class was very valuable and up to date in describing the kinematics and dynamical control for a Quadrotor.,4
90859,Has allot of typos but the content is good overall,4
90864,only recommended for those who have knowledge in linear algebra and calculus,4
90870,"I found the course fun and engaging. I studied Physics a while ago; without this I think I would have had problems following the contents.I wish the first two programming assignments were combined, so that there was room for another assignment for implementing a full 3d controller that doesn't assume a linearization around the hover state.",4
90872,Not for beginners. Prerequisites definitely required,4
90873,"This course had an excellent syllabus, but left much to be desired in the methodology adopted for teaching. There was very low involvement of the TA in the discussion forums and there should have been more material given to help bridge the gap between pre requisites and the course content.",4
90874,"I loved the course, it was way beyond my expectations. Everything well explained. I only have on critic. I think the assignment of 5 waypoints trajectory was not in accordance with the rest of the course. Imagine the tests following a level line and abruptly changes to something too hard. I think the purpose here is to learn and not find out people with special skills. Many of our colleagues that were following the course simple gave up due to this assignment. And also took 25 hours average for many of us, that not dispose of this time, since the proposed time to complete the tasks are of three hours.",4
90875,A good lecture material. All is presented step by step and clearly. I would like more exercise on the calculation of the rotation matrix on the transformation and displacement of objects. Thanks Professor Vijay Kumar and support team.,4
90879,"I liked the course and the assignments. I felt that the assignments covered materials which weren't part of the course or not explained well enough. I managed to get through them, but it felt lacking.",4
90885,"This course covered a lot of material, provided a well-rounded intro to the physics of 3D motion in the quad rotor context, included excellent supplemental videos to explain some of the tough mathematical concepts, and included well-designed practical assignments.The bridge between lecture and assignment, particularly the trajectory planning question in the last assignment, could be refined as the course iterates, although the material I found myself struggling through that very tough problem may be that which I retain most from this class.Over all an excellent class, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",4
90886,"The course contains a lot of good tools and techniques needed for a robotics enthusiast, but the material is not very well explained. A lot of background knowledge and self-research is expected to keep up with the course.",4
90890,"Great course, I would recommend this course for anyone interested in Quadrotors and programming algorithms to control them!The assignments based on MATLAB simulations were also a fun approach to visually observing our algorithms in use!",4
90892,"Good course overall, since I took it the first time it was offered it was still not quite polished. I liked the focus on quadrocopter simulation and creating controllers. I think it would benefit from more specific discussion forums for quizzes/assignments, being able to view past quiz attempts, and cleaning up typos/errors in the material.",4
90893,"TAs should have been more available/active in discussions (especially given the scale of the last assignment), otherwise enjoyable/challenging course",4
90896,"There were minor errors in the quizzes but I loved the course, would be nice to use some open source tool besides matlab.Best regards.",4
90898,"Very interesting course, with some toothing problems and unrealistic timescales for many.For me, it would have been impossible to complete the course without the support of some extremely bright and helpful classmates, active in discussion fora (almost a given in a MOOC, but nevertheless, a course should be designed such that one could complete it without the fora).More guidance on the programming assignments would be the first thing I would focus on for the next edition, as well as setting some realistic timescales (there is probably no way for the majority of participants to complete the last assignment within the 3 hours advised for it...).",4
90901,Great assignments to solidify an excellent curriculum.,4
90903,This is a good course with good support. But it still has a few teething problems.,4
90905,"This is a more difficult online course that you will come across. I give 4 stars because of the pretty nice content. Learning about writing linear controllers for the desired trajectory in 3D is the best thing we can get out of the course. I don't think this course qualifies as a beginner specialization. Basics (and perhaps little more details) of the topics from Dynamics(Euler equations, differentiation of a vector expressed in one frame wrt to another frame), controls and bit of computation(complexity) is needed. Topics like ""Calculus of variation"" were simply new to me and you have to work little more harder to understand the different equations which will be presented without any derivation. Biggest downside is TA's or other support staff is not pro-active. Perhaps they will improve in the future runs.",4
90907,Very interesting course. Pleasant and well explained. The mathematics related are complicated to follow sometimes but it can be done. The assignments also can be completed following the lectures and the handouts.,4
90910,"Although not specifically stated as a requisite this course does rely heavily on mathematics (especially matrix calculations). I did not understand all of the mathematics but was still able to complete the course succesfully. The general idea behind the math was well enough explained. The example videos, excercises and quizes were great fun and inspiring.",4
90912,"Very technical course with a mixture of theory and programming. It covers most of the topics related to drone control algorithms and trajectory planning. I would have liked additional topics about PID, quaternions and Kalman filters.",4
90915,"Very interesting course. Lectures were very informative howeversome test questions, especially in first quiz, where not covered directlyin course materials.",4
90918,Quizzes are generally not related to topic but course is great. Thanks..,4
90922,"Overall a good course. But I would suggest the following updates:-there are many formulas in the course that are not explained, just dropped in the slides-there are many inconsistencies in notations (for instance the Kv, Kp used sometimes, other times Kd and Kp)-programming labs should be given in an incremental approach; ex. instead of just requesting a full solution for a given problem, a stepwise approach where the functions are built up to produce intermediate results and slowly add complexity to reach that final goal is much more efficient as a learning tool-supplementary notes are not available-slides for the main lectures are available but they are attached to the videos; it would be better if they are added as an item in the course outline. Many other courses on Coursera do the same thing. Also it would spare the presenter to break down the slide pack into parts corresponding to the videos; just place the whole slide pack for a lesson.",4
90938,"The content is awesome and the quizzes and assignments are challenging. What I would incorporate is a little bit more of examples to tackle all the problems new people might encounter (more sample numerical results, and probably samples on how to develop in Matlab, not just reserved words).",4
90945,Course material is very dense and requires some background in maths/physics to understand it well. Could be better if it is extended to 5 - 6 weeks having more assignments.,4
90953,"could me much better , if the questions in the quiz can actually related to the lecture",4
90958,I would only like this course better if it was longer and more in-depth. Excellent!,4
90961,"This is a very interesting course focusing on the legacy of two US presidents and one wife of a president--Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. In particular, I enjoyed the attention given to the contributions of Eleanor Roosevelt during and after her husband's administration.",4
90962,I enjoy the interaction and interface scopes to really delve into a history and biography type course.,4
90964,I enjoyed this class and learned a lot. The intervening research topics did not seem to be part of the grading for this course and I am not sure if anyone did them after the first one. The final peer assessment project just asked for a repeat of everything that had been said in the class since the final lecture went all the way up to Obamacare. There was no room to add anything to what the course had already said.,4
90970,"It was a good course, but maybe it could be better with more electronic topics.",4
90980,"Very great course, I get a lot of MongoDB and Mongoid knowledge. This course is hard for the new comer of Ruby on Rails and MongoDB. Assignment is a challenge job, sometimes assignment is a huge job. Suggest that better break down the assignment which over 30 pages. Maybe make this course from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, that is better.",4
90988,"Hard course but satisfying also. Practice exercises are quite long, and sometimes a little hard to read and understand (I say so as a non native english speaker)",4
90998,"It's a very course content, but level of difficulty is hard for an online training.",4
91000,"Is very cool course, with a lot of interesting thing, but definitly is not for inexperienced developers.",4
91002,Very good course! An in depth and comprehensive class on Rails + Mongo DB.Pros:- Topic explanations are short and on point- Homework and treated topics are closely relatedCons:- Homework debugging is slow on Windows- Sometimes it is necessary to read on extra material on line,4
91009,"Hi there, this course was great but i will recommend to split the large lectures in 2 and add more dynamic content and make the examples in rails project instead of the console will be great this course has been in the end a bit boring because i the professor need to be more fluid and make it more funny! for say it in some way for everything else it was a great course thanks you!",4
91013,"well done!all about i have to know about mongodb, but the assignment are too much time expensive for who have a job, like me",4
91016,This class is very demanding but fun to learn!,4
91018,"All the information and content given is great and necessary to work with mongo db. unfortunately, the timing and pacing is really tough because it relies on pretty long assignments. Take this course if you can handle going through 20 pages of instructions for a homework or 2, or you need a fast paced review of mongo and mongoid coupled with rails.",4
91024,"Really great course, make me understand a lot about rest and HTTPGreat instructor!Congratulations",4
91026,Thank you!,4
91032,I've chosen to give this course 4 stars. The videos were clear and thought provoking and both instructors were coherent and friendly. As a visual learner I liked the many grids and charts and especially the animated story about the two social innovators whose names I've forgotten. Overall it was an enjoyable and beneficial learning experience!,4
91050,"Very cool, hands-on course :)",4
91053,"This course was very good, but for people with less calculation experience, it takes far more time than posted. Also, it would be helpful to upload pdfs of slides so that formulas are more easily accessible and we don't have to scan back through videos to find them.",4
91054,This is a good course and I enjoyed the video lectures. The course's reliance on peer-reviewed quizzes was not conducive to learning however. Coursera should seriously consider refraining from peer-reviewed assessments. The student's knowledge can easily be measured using traditional testing methods and the peer-reviewed materials could easily be modified.,4
91056,just as good as part 1. Neat old professor. A bit more abstract than 1.,4
91062,Very interesting! I would recommend this course to everyone ! Especially the assignments made me look at myself and the world in a different way.,4
91074,The course did not continue as it was in its Part-1.,4
91075,"A wonderful insight into why we believe, and what effect deeply held beliefs have on out behaviour.",4
91076,A very good course that makes you think.,4
91081,It has been a really interesting course facing all the statements involved in the sanitation.,4
91083,very usefull and have a lot information,4
91093,this a great cour!,4
91094,Good course for beginners..,4
91099,"Awesome and excellent course for students, professional and everyone interested in Planning & Design of Sanitation Systems and Technologies for low income countries like my country Liberia.",4
91106,"really learnt a lot,i wish they conduct more couses on architecture as well",4
91107,I havent received my certificate for completing this course why ?,4
91110,"Informative and motivating, especially to the young and passionate environmental engineers.",4
91113,"The course was amazing, throw up a wide vista of knowledge for me and would really enrich my job delivery and concept development on Sanitation Systems and Technologies. The administrators however need to improve on post-course inquiries, i have been on the trail to get my SOA for some time now with no success.",4
91115,Great course!!!,4
91127,Very good and helpful for understanding any sanitation system and technologies.,4
91136,Highly usefull overview of different technologies and minor improvements to existing systems,4
91150,This is an awesome course which provides different techniques of sanitation and to access it. It focuses about the technology and treatment facility . These techniques must be adopted for better and healthy environment.,4
91158,GreaT!,4
91171,Great course. Very interactive and content well explained!,4
91176,Good course to learn...,4
91181,"Good course. Good recalls, easy learning, short time investment.",4
91182,"It is very easy and clear, good for all the first year international students who did not perform well in TOEFL or GRE. Maybe a little bit too easy and too slow for advanced learner.",4
91187,"This course, honestly, is very impressive to me for it providing a vide view in English.",4
91193,The course was very useful! Through it I have learned how to organize my professional speech and be more confident and informative in it. Only one advice for a future improvement of course - please add more examples of speeches and more phrases into videos...,4
91198,Very good for the beginners.,4
91199,It's a very good way to improve one's speaking skills. I really recommend it.,4
91206,I have learned quite a lot with this course. Thank you !!!!,4
91220,"it's a good course, helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english. The only problem that i find whit this course isn't about the course, it's about the peer to peer grading, is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes, not in all cases.Also is a short course, the assignments are very simple and that makes it an easy going course, i would recommend it for intermmediate english stundents.",4
91226,This course gives me useful advices to practice and improve my language skills.Thank you to lecturers Mrs. Amalia and Ms. Leah.,4
91230,thank you.,4
91232,"good instructors and content , i enjoyed it",4
91237,Very excellent but we can't pass the exam if you are not pay.,4
91240,This course is very useful for someone if have pronunciation problems. It's more about fluency and your pronunciation.Hope you all get the those skills.,4
91248,I loved this course ... very easy to understand i discovered new things i didn't know! Thank u.,4
91249,very good online course. I personally learned a lot.,4
91256,This course is great! It's so useful!,4
91269,"I haven't completed it yet, but I loveit already",4
91270,thank you very much ....,4
91274,pretty easy but I can't finish it because I didn't meet the equipment requirement,4
91276,I love it very much.thank you for all the effort.,4
91283,"Excellent course with excellent teachers, i did not regrete my enrolling",4
91284,It's a good course,4
91289,Great teaching.The teacher 'pronunciation is very clear.,4
91308,The course is a little easier for professions.,4
91316,very effective learning and interesting too..,4
91323,"Nice course, the language is very easy for all.",4
91325,Interesting!Have learned a lot.,4
91327,It's really helpful . As we can be accessed to top universities throughout the world . With this course we can build up our confidence while speaking in English .,4
91333,Very cool.,4
91334,"Really great course.If it's free, that would be 5-star perfect.~",4
91341,It is unfortunate that this course paid. The course very interesting.,4
91342,it's amazing and more helpful for improving communication skills,4
91343,Very helpful. Thank you!,4
91346,"I have not yet to finish all the modules of this course, though. I can find it quite valuable for all persons seeking to improve thier English, not least for non-native speakers. On top of it, what sets this class apart from the others is instructor's attitude. To put it more detailed, it is easily noticed that they incessantly endeavor to impart prime information as clearly as possible. Really appreciate Georgia Tech for offering such like this source on the house",4
91350,it is helpful for me to improve my speaking,4
91352,The teacher is very nice. The content of the class is clear to understand. I think it fits people who have little English language using experience but want to improve. I would hope to learn more specific things during the course.,4
91355,"As an advanced English speaker, for me this course goes too little into improvement of pronounciation.The tips for conversations - small talk, phone, online etc. - are only very basic as well.Good course for beginners though and I also liked the interspersal of little questions and tasks along the way (although also too simple imo).Very good - but obviously only paid content - are the teamwork assignments.",4
91358,"The course do cover a few facets of speaking English professionally and it's very helpful. I feel, however, it is not so much deep and concrete as it didn't take much time to apply the techniques and cover a boarder range of situations.",4
91359,Great course!,4
91360,Very nice course.,4
91365,Good for pronunciation,4
91371,Very Nice job i am very glad because i like this lesson is very useful to gain my knowledge very much.Thank you so much and i wish you Good luck for better work and more courses.,4
91374,very useful,4
91382,they are awesome.,4
91389,"I have almost completed week one. I learned about what words to stress in a sentence and how to use the innotation at the end of the sentence. It is fun to go through the course contents. I would have given it five stars when it actually have helped us by giving analogies on more conversations formally and informally. Well, thank you.",4
91399,"It's better than the first course of this specialization. but as i mentioned in the survey, i think lesson 2 that includes 3 huge parts of PMBOK is not a great thing.",4
91402,very informative and practical with examples.,4
91406,This was very insightful,4
91412,Great!,4
91414,"generally good, but need more case studies",4
91416,"While I found this to be a helpful course, some of the most helpful 'walk throughs' were imbedded in bonus videos. Would like to have been able to easily access slides in a pdf format since there was so much info on each. There were less lectures and more slides than expected.",4
91420,I feel I have a good overview/introduction to the topic.,4
91428,"the final quiz should be more difficult, or questions reworded to help internalize information in a deeper way.",4
91431,good course in project management field,4
91433,Too easy. Making it harder and more realistic would have been better for me.,4
91434,"It is very good, but a little short on detailed information.",4
91438,Good course with practical situations. Just need a scenario for practicing the skills,4
91440,This is really helpful and reinforces what I have studied previously in my advance Diploma.,4
91441,Very Helpful!!!,4
91442,"No regrets on taking this course, been worth while!",4
91455,"Introduces helpful methods when it comes to estimating the duration of the project. The case study videos are fun to watch. The slides/lesson from the PMI are a little bit dry and formal, especially those depicting the different processes with their inputs and outputs. As in the preceeding course, I wish everything was a little bit more 'hands on'.",4
91457,Good course for basic and mid level project management professional having practical exposure.,4
91463,Great course,4
91465,This course is beneficial to my personal life and business career. Course lessons are explained well and easily understood.,4
91468,"Excellent content, well explained. The flash lessons could be slightly better structured.",4
91473,"After completing this course you'll have a good idea on how professional PMs schedule and budget complex projects. It will also teach you some valuable techniques that can be applied to projects you may be handling in your own work. I was unfortunately not impressed by the fact that the final exam was quite simple, simply borrowing questions already asked during the lesson quizzes.",4
91496,easy to understand and good explanation.,4
91497,"I like this coruse and I hope to allow downloading the lessons as ""PDF"" for the students to get more benefits and to save these lessons as References",4
91501,A great course. Has increased my knowledge tremendously.I will willingly recommend it to others.,4
91504,Very good information and good to see current highly praised project managers being interviewed and giving their opinions.,4
91510,"Helpful course to get a good understanding of budgeting and scheduling projects. Obviously, nothing trumps experience, however this course supported me in how to think about the budgeting and scheduling aspect of a project, and what are the key terms and ideas to keep in mind during that process.",4
91511,"Wonderful course. It was very well written with all major topics covered. Bonus video and Panelists Interview were also very helpful. However I would like to mention a small mistake in the week 4th's lesson, slide no. 3.23 has a network diagram, which has last activity written A instead of I. It changes the calculation for complete forward and backward pass. Also, Margaret explained the network forward and backward pass with the value of first day as 1. However in the lesson it was taken as 0, which again changes the formulas she described in the video. It's not difficult to understand the difference but it somehow breaks the harmony.",4
91516,"A good overview for budgeting and scheduling projects. The course focuses on the basics, but also does a good job of introducing more advanced methods for both financial and schedule management.",4
91518,"The subject gets appropriately harder in this part of the specialization, but the problems with certain parts seeming to have been rushed persists.",4
91535,Amazing Lecturer.,4
91541,"I wish I could see actual budgeting process. Will be very useful to see how to get the gross, net gross, and average revenue of the projects in different areas...",4
91544,"A little more complex, good for someone who has already seen a company go through the budgeting and scheduling processwould like to see more information on the videos since I feel like there were points missing that you had to read through and guess instead what was important.",4
91553,"I think this was really concise and packed with great information, but there was less of a focus on budgeting than I would have liked.",4
91557,It's brief but it could help you for reviewing some concepts.,4
91560,Very good introduction for persons interested in learning m,4
91565,flash needed otherwise would have been 5 stars,4
91574,"it's too overview with not enough details, as for me. But is usefull at all",4
91577,"Nice course, Clears basic Concepts....",4
91580,"Good, practical advice.",4
91591,really useful,4
91593,great course,4
91596,Good teaching by Dr Chuck.,4
91601,"I think Chuck is easily one of the best instructors I have studied under and like the previous courses, he has been really good in this course as well; however, I think in the Week 5 lectures, he could have spent a bit more time to explain all the different concepts he has used/introduced in his programs, some of which he had explained previously but some of them are surely not covered before example the use codecs.open and when to use that and so on..there are other examples as well. Overall, the course is very well taught although the last assignment was just too easy and does not really test the knowledge and understanding of the subject.",4
91615,Very interesting course.,4
91619,Very helpful in building a basic understanding of working with databases through Python.,4
91622,It was a very great experience to have this course. this has given me a lots of things to gain. I thanks to courser and group for p,4
91623,"easy to learn, Prof is so nice and cool !",4
91641,I know that Dr. Chuck mentioned that he can't cover everything about databases and SQL. But I felt that the content could have been a bit more informative.Thanks a lot Dr. Chuck and the teaching staff.,4
91642,"Good course for brief understanding of databases, but not about using Python with databases",4
91646,"All the chapters have been well explained. However, the last chapter was a bit vague and needed deeper insight; especially the code used for data visualisation.Thanks Dr. Chuck!!!",4
91651,Really straight forward content and great overview of SQL + SQLite. Nice python demos. Sometimes the instructor wanders a bit before he gets to his point.,4
91657,A very good Course for the beginners.,4
91659,Assignment codes should only be partially given.,4
91663,Good introduction to using python with simple databases.,4
91670,"Great course! Dr. Severance really put a lot of thought and effort into his videos and assignments.This course took a big leap, in terms of program complexity, from the prior courses in the series. This course could have been twice as long, and dug deeper into the details.",4
91672,"A bit more actual programming would be good rather than minor tweeking of existing code. Overall, a good basic into to relational database with Python.",4
91676,The assignments can be more challenged,4
91700,"Good class for new comers, and in order to be professional, you need to learn more about it.",4
91703,assignment difficulty level should be increased...,4
91707,"Excellent Course, but I would have liked more exercise and design process",4
91712,"Unlike the other courses, the material was quite new. And the videos were shorter than the first one. The assignments were also quite simple too",4
91715,"Good course at an appropriate level. I'd like to see more advanced topics in a related course, like optimization, multi-threading, database management. Some discussion of non-relational databases would also make sense.",4
91719,NOT COVERED IN DEPTH..JUST OVERVIEW,4
91722,The way dr chuck take us through all the material is quite fascinating and really enjoyed him through all way.,4
91724,"Maybe, it will be useful to add more theory about 3 normal forms?Thank for awesome database introduction. I've had lack of practice with 3 normal forms, but you fixed it.",4
91728,"a bit too easy, especially the assignments.",4
91738,I enjoyed learning Python with Database,4
91741,"Solid foundational database concepts in Python if you're looking to learn the basics or brush up on fundamentals. However, if you're looking for more advanced topics, you might want to look at more advanced classes.",4
91743,Good Course,4
91764,Thanks Dr Chuck. It has been a very fun learning experience.,4
91767,very good and interesting module which help me relate to line of work,4
91770,It's better to use Python 3 version.,4
91779,"Teacher was good, but the hand in assignments were much too simple. They didn't challenge me, and I didn't really get to practice the new things we've learned. All assignments were just about copy/paste 3-4 lines in existing code, and make a minor change to it.",4
91783,Great information but the homework is a little to easy and I don't think I was able to comprehend it that well.,4
91785,Great course. Awesome way to get started in databases. Should be more hands on on the Python part,4
91787,Excellent course :) Really enjoyed it!!!,4
91793,"This is a very good course, but probably more SQL will make it even better.",4
91800,Still needs more practise,4
91801,"This works really well for an introduction on databases and how to use them with Python. The exercises are maybe a bit too easy. On the one hand, this makes it easy to actually complete the course (and you still learn the basics), but on the other hand, you don't get that familiar with the material.The lecturer is intelligent and funny and structured.",4
91804,Good course. I just expected my last assignment to be more challenging. But with the examples given we can create challenges for ourselves on real life projects.,4
91808,Really good course. Clear discussion of databases and how they are used.,4
91810,"Although the theory was getting denser, we passed through it too quickly, and the assessments were too light. Even though the aim is to have students investigate and go deeper by themselves, I think we should have been prompted to do some further development.",4
91821,"awesome, very good explainded, and very enjoyable",4
91841,"Excellent course! Maybe It would be better to center in some points of the examples instead of providing so many, but in any case, a recommended course.",4
91848,Useful info. Now we start to get some Python super powers,4
91853,Excellent introduction to databases. The tests need to be a bit challenging!,4
91856,Nice done as always,4
91857,Learned a lot,4
91858,The difficulty level of the assignments could be increased !,4
91862,"I felt that more time could have been spent going over the python code in the last section. The code was made available, and it is up to the students to review the code at their own pace. This is good. It may further help to go over the code in the video lectures themselves.",4
91864,"I like this series a lot. I didn't like that the last assignment is peer graded though, because now I have to wait for somebody to see my assignment and grade it... :( but otherwise, this was fun and a good introduction to working with databases! I learned a lot.",4
91865,"I hope this can be a little bit more challenge. All the assignments are easy to be finished, some of them can be done within minutes. Comparing with JHU's R programming, that can be too hard, though.",4
91866,"Very good, felt like we could have done more work with hands on file writing and coding but it was nice to build off of someone elses.",4
91873,"a good introduction to how to interact with database.If you want to grasp more deeply,you 'd better read the free book--python for infomatics(3rd edition).",4
91884,Assignments were too easy :(,4
91895,An enjoyable presentation of this topic. Gives a decent overview without going into depth. Charles is a great teacher.,4
91918,"I liked the course. As with the previous three courses, Dr. Severance does a great job presenting the material and explaining how the code works. I felt that the assignments and the book were lacking a little bit:1. The textbook needs to be updated to include the Object Oriented Programming section that is covered in Week 1.2. There is no programming exercise for the OOP section, just a quiz.3. There are no assignments in the textbook for Chapters 14 and 15. The examples of the code and how it works is awesome, though, which is a trade off of sorts.4. The Chapter 14 programming assignments only require minimal programming in Python and/or SQL. I would have liked to do a little more programming.5. Chapter 15 felt like it was shoved in at the end, and the assignment was really easy. I was hoping for a little more rigor on that one, also.Overall, it was a good experience and I'm looking forward to finishing up this specialization when the Capstone is unlocked and becomes available.",4
91923,Good Course but slightly schizophrenic due to the object oriented topics. Don't feel that they belong in this course and would be really ticked off if paid for it.,4
91925,Could dive a little bit further into the topic,4
91933,"Nice course, but it needs stronger assignments.",4
91940,"A good introduction to the basics of SQL and an excellent, intuitive description of the workings of databases with motivations for them. Gets a little 'hand-wavy' at parts but is fine for a less experienced programmer.",4
91946,Excellent - but I wish that the course had tougher assignments to really push me to practice on the topic - although I admit this is hard to grade.,4
91958,Really enjoyed this course..,4
91967,Touches on a lot of subjects. Each having its own complexity. I'd have loved of the concepts are covered in a little more depth.,4
91977,Great course!,4
91983,"Lecturer is in the right mind, I really liked his presentation and the course itself. Very beneficial for my profession.",4
91996,I would have liked to write more Python code to interact with the databases during the course of the homework assignments. The lectures were VERY good.,4
91998,too simple TT,4
92002,Overall pretty good. The assignments didn't require much effort or understanding to complete.,4
92003,The course and the lectures are very good. But the assignments are bit to easy and hence its easy to pass without putting in the effort really learning what taught.,4
92006,"Short, but jam packed with stuff you need to know in order to get working with Databases. The ending lesson was a little disappointing as we weren't tested on how to do some of the suggested projects that the teacher was talking about and instead only had to download and run a program on our computer. However, this class equips you with the knowledge to get a start in Data Science and Database engineering, as well as good practice and better understanding of how to use Python.",4
92010,Very good and interesting course.,4
92014,"Good and reasonbly understandable.Props for the clear, personal and upspiriting way of telling.",4
92019,The course is good but the Content can be improved and enriched. It shall be deeper 'cause databases are a very important t,4
92022,quit useful and good for beginner,4
92024,"Topics covered are great, but there is a lack of assignments to be done by students completely on themselves.",4
92031,Very informative. Need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning,4
92041,Another mind-opening course from Dr. Chuck. I really enjoyed it. I would like to recommend to everyone who wants to leverage their skill in Python programming.,4
92046,Very interesting topic but enough practical exercises,4
92051,"Great course, really helpful lectures on the intregration of SQL / relational databases in Python.",4
92059,"This course only touches on python + relational databases. Specifically, investigates SQLITE and the sqlite3 python library. The work is very minuscule (assignments were to simply modify pre-written python scripts). Nevertheless, good introduction to DB coding in python.",4
92066,Excelent course to begging with databases using python,4
92083,"As with the third course in the specialization, the lectures give just enough to allow students to independently advance their learning outside the course. To be honest, I think the instructor covers too much ground in too short a time for most students to gain a lot of understanding. Furthermore, the assignments are quite straightforward requiring minimal adaptation of the supplied code.The module on Object Orientated Programming is, frankly, a waste to time and a distraction. There are no practical exercises and the material is run through at a pace that makes it unlikely that anyone without prior knowledge would make any sense of it. What is more, there is no reference to, or use of, OOP at any other point in the course or specialization. The time would have been better spent in expanding the modules on the core topics of using databases with Python.On the positive side, the external tools on Dr Chuck's own website seem to work as expected and integrate smoothly with Coursera. The forums also remain supportive, although, as with most courses, far less active than on the old platform.I still rate this as a 4 star (albeit a 4-) as Dr Chuck is such an engaging instructor and there is still a good progression through the specialization. I would be more cautious if taking this as a standalone course.",4
92084,Great course! I wish we were supposed to do more coding in the weekly exercises.,4
92086,"Great course and additional materials. The last week seemed a bit too far away from the previous one, though. Still it was manageable and understandable, Thanks.",4
92096,Thank you doctor Chuck!,4
92103,Would love to have more challenging assignments,4
92105,"The course is easy, but informative.",4
92106,There was not as much coding as prior courses but students can learn the knowledge of database.,4
92110,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error. However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject. Dr. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable. For any novice programmers looking to understand how Python interacts with databases, this is the best place to start.",4
92120,"The course is great, but I hope I can get to the final project. I have a little bit experience in python, so I skipped the first two courses of the specialisation project. But I still want to try the 5th one, which is locked to me now~",4
92123,It is good short course but could be better if it is more detailed and l could work on more examples but the last week was awesome.,4
92126,"Rather interesting, but I felt the questions and programs were too easy.",4
92129,The course videos and lecture materials were good. But the homework assignments were easy.,4
92137,"This course gives very basic information about using python to retrieve web data in json and html format. It's helpful and makes the learners feel good. This course is that it prepares almost ready codes for every test and homework. This could be a good reference for people who want know how to do sth, but have no much time digging into the complex way. However, it may also reduce the strength of learning.",4
92139,Great to learn how easy the SQL and Python integrate. Very straightforward examples and tests. Well explained and exactly what was needed.,4
92145,"The course is great in that I felt I gained alot of insight into how data mining is done but I don't feel I gained much skill in using databases with python. The assignments are making minuscule modifications to existing code. I think it would have been a better exercise to either write a new program for each assignment or have the student build out a single program throughout the course. But, as always, Dr. Chuck is the best.",4
92151,Not much exercises.,4
92159,"It's a good one, but could be better having more applications.",4
92161,"Very nice and very good intstructor. Clear examples. Clear presentation. However, some assignments are a bit too easy, even for beginners. Learnt a lot!",4
92164,not as fun and challenging as other 3 preceding Python courses but still a great one!,4
92175,"+ I appreciated the visual nature of the course+ I appreciated the background info on databases+ I liked learning SQL and using the SQLite browser.- update to python3, I'm running python3 and found it difficult to correct the issues with urllibs in the ifnal assignmet.",4
92176,"I liked this course, but I think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging.",4
92205,"Dr. Chuck once again breaks down very complex subject matter into easily digestible chunks for us newbies. My only issue with this course is that the hardest parts of the assignments were already done and all that was required from us was some slight tweaking in existing code. That may or may not be intended and the real challenge lies with the Capstone Project.Nonetheless, if you are curious about how databases work, there's lots to learn here. I know I did!",4
92206,"Very neat course. I really recommend it for these who start with Python,or just want to remind themselves such topics.",4
92215,Very good introduction to databases and the use of this with python. uses python 2 version. Simple explanation for beginners. Recommended.,4
92217,"This is an extremely high level introduction to SQL and how to use DBs in data processing programs.If you have no experience you will get a feeling and some basic idioms to apply, so it is a good start.If, like me, you already have a good SQL knowledge but little Python knowledge you can quickly learn how to access DBs and just go through the videos to have an easy overview of interesting applications.As in previous courses I appreciated Dr. Chuck relaxed exposition and some of his interviews with people I just had their names on my books, like Tannembaum.",4
92221,"The Professor is amazing, with a great sense of humor. But, I felt that the last three assigments were rather easy, given the fact that the code was almost all produced by the Professor.",4
92226,Great curse. But assingments were to easy,4
92230,I'd expected it to be more difficult.,4
92240,Course is very good itself but assignments is very easy.,4
92248,lectures are good. hw assignments are just a tad too easy. i believe diligent students could handle slight;y more difficult assignments,4
92262,Pretty easy for beginners to catch up with!,4
92269,"As always great level of teaching by Dr. Chuck, but milestone tasks was not so challenging as within previous course. Thanks!",4
92281,This course is easy to understand how python works.,4
92283,A bit too easy. I really wish there'd be a more advanced project for us to better understand and implement the database and python,4
92287,"Generally an outstanding course, however I was a bit concerned that the video lectures, programming assignments, and quizzes didn't exactly follow the book.",4
92289,The only reason I can't give this course a 5 star rating is the final assignment is not substantial enough. Otherwise this is the best course series for any beginner or someone trying to refresh their programming knowledge.,4
92291,very nice coaching by chuck,4
92300,"The instructor and the contents are great, but the assignments are not challenging.",4
92303,"Overall, an excellent course, as all courses from Dr Chuck.The last assignment could have been more demanding to stretch our learning before the Capstone.It is a real pity that one has to pay for all previous courses in order to take the final Capstone :-(Well done!",4
92332,"very objective, but a little simple.",4
92342,A little bit too easy,4
92345,"This course could do with harder assignments. This last one was just ""run my code"" and screenshot stuff. Learned a lot though",4
92346,Great course. A great extension to the original course,4
92377,Another great class that covers a lot of information that builds nicely on the preceding classes. I would like to see an additional Exercises per topic that more complex. Maybe add an extra credit or bonus one.,4
92381,Comprehensive overview of disease screenings for clinicians as well as public health professionals,4
92382,Very interesting course but work needs to done on the language component which was sometimes very confusing. Some really good Powerpoint presentation work.,4
92383,"Excellent content , but weak language commanding with a strong accent",4
92384,"Overall good quality course, interesting and relevant. The only drawback are the quizzes because sometimes the answer is not clear, even after watching carefully the video and reading material.",4
92392,Very useful course for Russian speaking beginners. Everything explained in a very simple understandable manner.,4
92402,"useful ""tecnical"" information about implementation",4
92414,"It was more about technical stuff and less about art itself. Well, it was pretty good!",4
92425,Thank you for helping me to make better photographies. Family and friends are really excited to see the difference in comparison to the pictures I made before. You are doing a great job.,4
92437,"Good start on Python and some sequence analysis, looking forward to start programming more",4
92441,I learned a great many Python knowledge from this course. It would be better if the quiz and course material can be connected more closely.,4
92444,It was good and practical.,4
92445,"Started very easy, but became quite hard at the end. Nicely structured and conveyes everything that is needed. However, sometimes I missed why specific tools have been used and not others.",4
92457,This course was in line with my expectations. Sometimes exercises were a bit out of context. I would have probably dedicated more time to Biopython.,4
92460,"For a person with absolutely not knowledge of programing its a very nice course to take. Its could be more widely explote the Biopython part, but reading the Biopython cookbook and the baisis presented here its just perfect",4
92461,"Good for what it is, but I was hoping for something more advanced (on the algorithm/programming side).",4
92468,Very good--perhaps a little slow for those who have already learned a half-dozen languages.,4
92471,The lectures were really good. I am a microbiologist and have very little background of computer programming. A more detailed course would have he,4
92472,Clear but some topic are not well explained and to pass the final quiz is necessary further detailed study.Very useful the help of the Mentor,4
92474,good course for python but you definitely need to have some background in programming to be able to pass. recommend python course by UMichigan here at Coursera.,4
92478,Pretty interesting. Made me think,4
92487,Some interesting content if you are interested in Serious Games.,4
92492,This is a fast pace course and I hope the instructors could explain a little bit more on some difficult concepts rather than just giving short descriptions.,4
92496,The contents are very intersting but it's too easy to achieve the certification.,4
92501,"Very well scripted course suitable for working executives. The assignments are designed in a way, which ensures that only studious and diligent students only can get through.The capstone project demands thorough understanding of the course and its contents.",4
92521,very useful and interesting introduction to strategic thinking.,4
92544,The course is very beneficial for people interested in Strategic Management history it gives an overview about strategical way of thinking with lots of examples and case studies. Instructor s tone is not monotonic and the readings given are interesting and will be an added value to your general knowledge!,4
92555,"Theory and practical knowledge. Very useful and insightful, especially if you're interested to learn about business, strategic management, and innovation.",4
92557,It looks a good course from its contents.,4
92559,"Great Course, I think would be better if has more examples",4
92563,Excellent! But need more examples and situations for the respective concepts. The level of difficulty shall be increased so that students will grasp more of the content!Thanks,4
92566,"A great course all round! The concepts are simple and well presented for those who haven't studied strategy before, but lots of room to learn through the discussion in the videos and additional reading for those of us who have seen this subject before.The test format I though was a bit over-simplified. I would have preferred to see slightly longer, more demanding tests, perhaps with a different question format. In particular, I found the questionnaire for the capstone project much too simplified - giving all or nothing points means we can't differentiate between people who only just achieved the point (or achieved it partially) and others who achieved it well. Needs an intermediate option.",4
92572,Great course for people new to business strategy.,4
92581,Enjoyed the course!,4
92582,Very Good and helpful,4
92584,Very crisp but informative as well.,4
92592,Very interesting course,4
92597,"The course itself is very informative and enlightening. The way Coursera structures the submission of assignments though, need to be seriously reworked to keep the numerous learners with creative unethical behaviors at bay.",4
92601,Really gained some valuable knowledge on the history of strategy and the current strategy being used by the corporations,4
92604,Course was really helpful and a wonderful experience,4
92607,"Perhaps too basic, but I think that a fair evaluation should consider that this course is just the first part of a Spacialization program.",4
92617,"very good,one of the best moocs on strategy.",4
92620,A great course. Must have for management lovers and entrepreneurs.,4
92622,I would have liked the level to be a bit higher as well as having my final submission reviewed by a course professional rather than strictly peer-to-peer review.I really liked the to-the-point yet well paced video material. Thumbs up!,4
92625,Really its very great to learn in coursera platform. This course is been very useful for me to understand all time business strategies from 1970's til now.,4
92629,The right kick for a good start,4
92632,C,4
92638,"Great course! :)But I believe the last modules were a little bit easier than the first ones... :) More concepts at the beginning and then more well-known case studies. They could have found a way to split both theory and practical teaching along the modules. Anyways: well done, CBS! I really liked this course! Cheers from Rio, Brazil.Rhai",4
92650,"I thought the course was really interesting and well taught. I think the quizzes and final assignment could be a little tougher but I understand there is a larger Kapstone project for the specialization. I really liked the additional resources, articles and videos provided and have added many of the articles and books to my reading list.",4
92657,Interesting introduction in the Business Strategy.,4
92662,Content is great. The final project pier feedback/grading could be upgraded. Prefer only one person reviewing in depth than 3 using multiple choice questions. Scales might work better.,4
92666,Only 4 stars because the Assignment was a bit of a disaster for non-professionals in Strategic Management.,4
92675,Great course!,4
92678,This course is really awesome.Opens up totally different thought process and introduces to some European firms which are really good.,4
92683,Well structured and presented (videos) with the right amount of support information. Clear quizzes consistent with each module.,4
92720,"Good course, capstone project was interesting",4
92722,Really enjoyed the content of this course,4
92733,Quite good - great examples. Complete and easy to follow.,4
92735,I like the way that this Course's brought to Students.,4
92739,"I learned a lot of the basics in R with this course.Sometimes it is a bit of a dissonance between the lessons and the assignments, and the programming style in the lessons might seem a bit old fashioned or cumbersome, but for good reason. There are a lot of packages in R than makes you do things easy, but knowing the base is very important. The practical assignments are challenging and fun. The video lessons are good. A big minus for misleading/unclear descriptions on how to deliver your assignments. A big plus for the peer review process.",4
92745,Peer review doesnt make sense. I would appreciate if TA or Instructor reviews it.,4
92748,"Programming assignment is not fully covered in the lectures, prefer to have subject metter completely covered instead of searching for everything online.",4
92752,Programming assignments can be little more explanatory,4
92756,"Great to learn. But some of the assignment instructions were not clear enough, and took a lot of time to figure out.",4
92771,Why is this review never stored?,4
92772,"This course is definitely a must for anyone and everyone who has not worked on R (doesn't know what R is about), but has some previous exposure to basic programming! I was satisfied with what I had learnt at the end of this course!",4
92780,Course is informative and assignments are helping you to learn more. Interactive exercises provided by swirl package are great to have hands-on experience on the functions. I will highly recommend this course and swirl package to my friends. Thanks!,4
92781,"good, can we have mini project as well, so that we have more hands-on to R?",4
92785,"The Swirl practice exercises are great, they're optional but I would highly recommend doing those.The graded assignments are pretty difficult considering only the basic concepts are discussed in the lectures, you definitely need to do some trial and error in R to figure out what you're doing.",4
92786,I have no background in R and thus benefited a lot from this course. It took me quite a while to figure out the programming assignments. I wish the course could provide more baby programming assignments to practice for beginners like me.,4
92790,very hard course. Very time in mind comsuming.,4
92796,Effective use of time. Jumped into useful things immediately.,4
92798,Good lessons and very good assignments,4
92809,More code and result demonstration would be better for understanding.,4
92814,"If you don't have experience programming, this course is probably impossible without extensive online research to complete assignments. Perhaps this is a good thing - I guess we're supposed to be learning how to 'hack' our education and find answers on our own in the future as we lead our own projects. Still, being a complete noob, I would have prefered a more robust introduction to the language. In the end, however, I did feel relatively competent (good enough to be dangerous to myself) in R after 4 weeks.",4
92818,"quite tough for someone without R-programming background, should add in more explanation in the course to help beginner passing the quiz",4
92826,"Great courses -- the only thing I would improve if possible, would be more incremental steps leading up to assignments. Swirl was a lifesaver for this, but I would love more Swirl exercises to get the hang of each topic.",4
92827,"I believe it is a great course, but its pretty hard to catch up how to code if u dont have basics of general coding: logical thinking and problem solving aproach.",4
92828,It is a very good introduction to R programming.Week 2 and Week 4 assignments were specially hard for me.,4
92832,Swirl was very useful,4
92841,"Swirl is very good. it would be good if it detected differences in input for a typo error, compared to a guess, and also if it ignores results if the expected outcome is achieved e.g. sqrt(x) and (x^0.5). i'm sure a clever identical() function in there could produce a responsive feedback like. ""OK, not quite what I was thinking, you should have type sqrt(x), but you seem to have managed to get t",4
92855,"This course is basic but the fist necessary step for anyone who want to be a master. The more your practice, the more you will learn from this course.",4
92856,Great Learning and I would recommend the Swi,4
92857,Good introduction. But could go more in depth.,4
92874,"Good course, but needs in depth discussion on few topics.",4
92876,Instructor's video is not very helpful,4
92879,Really good course.,4
92884,Swirl package really gave a lot. The lectures I find to be at times a bit slow-paced. All in all a great course.,4
92885,"A reasonable primer for R programing, that covers the basics of manipulating data sets. There are a couple of spots where the code is out of date, but that can be easily worked around.",4
92888,covers the basics well.,4
92891,This is a very good place to start if you want a career in data science. I really learnt a lot and currently using it my data analysis projects. I would recommend this course to any one who likes to work with data.,4
92894,This is a great course to start using R,4
92895,Good Course. The lectures are useful. But you will need to search a lot to complete your assignments!,4
92898,"This course is about elementary R programming , but programming assignments are not entry level. They are challenge for freshman. Overall it a good course to enter R programming.",4
92901,"The course is really good, intense, and ... hard ! I guess that more assignements in swirl are better to get people more used to the tool instead of just leaving them with a huge, deep Programming Assignement for them to complete.",4
92910,"A challenge for the beginner, lots is covered, little is explained about the completion of the projects. An excelent challenge for the investigative minded. Highly recommended, but not for the unitiated without conviction or the faint of heart.",4
92914,"Overall pretty good. Since I have no computer science background, some of the assignments were a bit challenging for me and the Swirl assignments were not particularly helpful. Overall, I feel like I learned the basics of programming in R and after completing the course I was able to write some simple programs that I can use in my day to day activities in the lab.",4
92920,The material is hard to take in for first time learner and the assignment is too difficult compared to what taught.,4
92931,"Needs more structure on R logic, development of R functions were very challenging. I would recommend maybe extending the course one more week to cover in depth the logic of R objects and functions and the lexical scope with practical exercises. Expand swirl() with more challenging commands.",4
92934,swirl is great learning tool,4
92941,It would be nice to have more complicated assignments which push brain to work harder,4
92943,"Good, but I expected more exercises.",4
92945,I wish to learn the language and master it. The course provides very good understanding of the basic concepts,4
92948,Good course.,4
92951,The course coverage is really good. The video lectures can have more examples from real time projects. The assignments are truly challengjng.,4
92952,Nice course. Learned a lot.,4
92956,"I think it was a good course, but the examples are basic while the assesments were pretty hard. Maybe it'd be splitted in two different courses.",4
92959,4* and not 5* for locked quizzes,4
92961,Need more practical exercises.,4
92965,Great to kickstart your R programming skills.A bit basic sometimes and exercices are not very advanced.,4
92966,Steep learning curve but the resources to succeed are there.,4
92969,The course was great but could be even better if the examined assignments would be more related to the actual course. The level here is very different. It would be great if more exercises could be introduced that lead to the more difficult assignments in the course.,4
92970,"It is well-organized.I don't know why but compared with the lectures, I prefer the swirl tool they use in this course...",4
92972,Simple and easy introduction to main concepts in R.,4
92977,Very good course. But the final test was too difficult. Almost impossible without external help for people like me with no experience in programming,4
92982,"Video lectures were useful and thorough, but the assignments included some materials and concepts that were not even talked about, which poses a huge problem for beginners. Maybe try splitting up R Programming into two levels, one for beginners and another for more advanced individuals?",4
92986,"The course gave good beginning to R programming. It will be good if you can add more examples, use cases, real time scenarios(explaining where that function can be used) when you teach. Assignments are of good standard. They made me to learn more about R. Overall, it gave a good exposure. If possible, add one mini project kind of thing along with assignments.",4
92990,Videos are a bit monotonous.,4
92991,The videos were informative but i didn't feel like we used the concepts from the videos very frequently.,4
92997,Vey Good Coursebut it need more Example and Practial session,4
93000,"The swirl exercises are very good. The assignments are quite challenging but enjoyable. The last one took me > 9 hrs. I would suggest to first give a sample assignment. And then in the theory discuss the tools for that assignment. And then give the assignment. The theory is a lot of explanation - which I am battling to ""hook"" onto something. Why - because I had not been exposed to an application opportunity. The text in the slides are too small to view on a phone. Overall I feel proud to have completed the course and it gives me confidence to attempt problems with R.",4
93002,"The course was great. Having no background in programming languages is surely a set back to complete this course. The first time I enrolled for this course, I cant go any further than a week. But in my second attempt I was determined to complete it and I did it. What I understand is, if you have passion to learn R , this is a nice course but you cant rely on the class teaching alone, there are quite a number of blogs from where you can get help to complete this course. I felt a huge gap between assignments and the teaching; means, one has to struggle a bit to complete the assignments. But may be thats how one can get better with the nuts and bolts of R. Again, the course discussion forum and a few blogs can guide you through to understand and complete the assignments.",4
93006,"It was great, though tough",4
93013,"Can move too quickly at times, but is very informative. I have learned more than I expected in a short period of time.",4
93015,Provides basic concepts in R.Recommended for any beginner,4
93017,"Overall course was good. I think there is a bit of a gap in terms of helping providing additional understanding of application of some the concepts in context of a solution. I think the course does a good job explaining the concept, but I feel the course could use some additional examples of application of the concepts to help facilitate the programming assignments. The Swirl exercise are good...but almost seem to rudimentary.",4
93019,Shorten the course will be better for participants,4
93028,Would like to see more examples.,4
93029,"Challenging for those without programming experience. But with hard work and forum, you can do it.",4
93032,"This R course is quite overwhelming for those who start learning R. R course from Duke university will walk through from step by step. From that, this would be wonderful to learn R from John Hopkins university.",4
93051,"Good course to get started and get you comfortable with manipulating data in R. However, does not cover object oriented programming, pivot tables or advanced plotting.",4
93052,Basics were taught but I wish it was more advanced to the point that I would feel comfortable doing data analysis in R on my own.,4
93054,Assignment 2 was a bit confusing,4
93056,Really great course. 4 stars for not allowing submissions of quizzes and program assignments without purchase.,4
93057,"Amazing Tutorial and course. The methods they use are simple but the lack of exercises in programming, its a downside. In my programming experience, it's needed more practical examples. Swirl is one side of the course that helps the user understand what R programming is, but in my opinion, different examples or projects are needed.",4
93062,A very good course. But i would have preferred much more exercises and may be instructor could have been a bit slow too. Overall I am quite satisfied.,4
93078,I think it will be more helpful if you already have some knowledge on coding.,4
93089,"Somewhat hard, but rewarding.",4
93090,"Good Lessons and exercises. I would have liked introduction to packages like dplyr, but may be that is introduced in other training modules.",4
93096,Very nice course to learn the basics of R that is required for data science.,4
93098,"Learning R in 4 weeks was quite tough. I haven't done serious programming for the last 25 years but the way in which the course was structured, assisted me in getting through the difficult parts. I battled the most with the notations, ie. when to use <- or = or ==? Also things like when to use ( or [. Might sound trivial to you, but for a first timer it can be quite confusing.I have come across a few ""cheat sheets"" which has helped me a lot. I am still using it and I'm busy with course 9 now. I don't think one should call it ""cheat sheets"", rather call it ""summary sheets"". If I can make a suggestion, I would like to see some of these ""summary sheets"" included in your courses as part of the supporting material.Thanks a lot.",4
93100,"The lectures are very informative and the exams are challenging, at least for a beginner like me.",4
93106,"Good course in general. Gives a introduction to R and its basic function and structures. I recommend this courses to the ones who start using R as an analytical tool and have some basic experience with programming or data analyses. Maybe some improvement would be nice: For example, some of the assignments weren't fully consistent with coursework. However, overall a great introduction to R programming.",4
93114,Solid introduction to R,4
93118,I'm really learning R with this course but it's a pity in the last quiz of week 4 the code asked to type in in the last 3 questions didn't work. However it was easy to work out what the question was trying to ask.,4
93121,A little difficult and fast but you do get to learn a lot. The plus point is that Coursera provides ample of time to get through with this course which really worked for me since and I'm working and studying both.,4
93125,"The assignements are excellent for learning. however, the last assignment for programming might be too difficult for total beginners. need to put in extra effort.",4
93143,"great overview, but pretty challenging for those without any programming experience.",4
93148,Interesting Course. really enjoyed the swirl practice assignments. Final assignment is quite difficult,4
93154,Wide course on R and perfect introduction to its world. Need quite a bit of effort for non programers,4
93157,"Great course. Challenging and requires some independent problem solving, but from my experience, that's the way it should be. Fun and interesting as well!",4
93160,"Pros:- If you don't know R well, or at all, you will learn a lot about R!- The projects were sufficiently challenging and used real data. Great experience.Cons:- Some knowledge required in the assignments are not covered at all in the lectures, or even the textbook.- The week 2 assignment was a bit less clear than it could've been.Other thoughts: I wouldn't recommend this course for someone new to programming. You should have at least SOME programming experience. Even for someone with some coding experience it can be quite challenging. But that's what makes it so FUN!",4
93163,Great job...projects were too hard..need more instructions on coding,4
93165,"课程比较多的讲述了R的基础知识，这是什么不会搜什么的学习方式所不能带来的。希望课程能增加一些更有趣的作业。同时，短时间内接触大量基础知识容易感到枯燥并且难以牢记，建议每一个视频后面增加短短的几个编程的习题，这样可以更快地掌握。The course is more about the basic knowledge of R, which is good considering that looking for the answer when meeting with problems cannot teach this. Hope that more interesting assignments could be added. Finally, too much basic knowledge makes people boring, it would be better if after each video the students could do some short programming tasks.",4
93166,"Chalenging exercices (I think a little too much), excelent readings, excelent presentation of R language.",4
93167,"Good One , but quiz 3 is not accepting right answers",4
93176,Good to learn fundamentals of R,4
93180,Good explanation and easy to follow.,4
93182,The course offers good insight into R programming for beginners. A little more application and examples would make the course even better.,4
93187,Few more examples would be much better..,4
93191,overall pretty solid. would love a bit more feedback and/or greater correlation between material and assignments. But overall nice introduction to R.,4
93192,"I would say 3-4 stars. Week 3 was kind of dense really. The assignment was also a little over my head not due to the complexity but certain aspects were not covered in length. Week 4 was good though, and it was enjoyable. Overall a really nice introduction to R and I would certainly recommend this course to my friends.",4
93193,"It was a great experience taking this online course. Love the swirl() learning package. The course difficulty level is appropriate for me. Worked hard, practiced a lot, and finally got all the credits and the certificate.",4
93194,"The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R. This being said, I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth (with further practice) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery. I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy, and only now (after completing the course here on Coursera, reading the textbook(s), and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R.This being said, the course was very well organized, had great examples, and excellent lectures (although the audio could be clarified by quite a bit using a higher-end microphone, preamp, interface, and affordable audio production software such as Reaper to clarify the voice).",4
93195,programming part would have been better with slightly more guidance,4
93197,An order of magnitude more difficult than the intro course. Unexpectedly tricky at times ( esp. if you're primarily versed in programming & not stats ) but more all the more worth it for the difficulty spike.,4
93198,"This course is really not easy to who is not in the domain of computer science. Even the computer science people, it's also not quite easy to familiar with that statistic program, e.g. R Programming. If having more ""trace program"" training, I'd be better for that students who I mention above.However, anyway, I very much enjoyed this course to know how to program to analysis a data set.Thank you very much.",4
93199,"Decent class with good programming assignments. I wish there had been more examples of actually writing code in the lectures, but that is my only complaint.",4
93203,should provide some live examples with every thing we study,4
93209,A great course that needs a little reorganization.,4
93214,"This is a good overview to R Programming, though the lectures leave much to be desired, at least for a programming beginner. Watching the videos left me confused about key concepts, which I absorbed much better through the Swirl interactive exercises, the discussion forums and other examples online. Of course we are supposed to be ""hackers,"" but I enjoyed this course much more once I just turned off the video, read through the slides and focused on other areas where I could learn the concepts.Also, the discussion forums were great for helping with key issues, and the homework assignments were also outstanding for making sure you absorb and apply concepts. So it's worth taking - just keep in mind the videos may not be for everyone...",4
93217,"I learned a lot fast in the class - but the assignments seemed very difficult, and often didn't match the content of the lectures. I enjoyed the class, and definitely earned all I learned.",4
93219,A lot of programing!!,4
93222,Not easy for new learners,4
93226,coursera的盈利项目，必须交钱才能take quiz and assignment。不过swirl还是很不错的。,4
93230,The prof speaks VERY FAST.,4
93247,Nice study for starting in field of Data Science,4
93261,"The course is very well laid out to demonstrate the main features of R programming language. (To elaborate on one thing that I liked) The programming assignment for the 4th week (rating/choosing hospital based on outcome) is very helpful to try out what I learnt from the course so far. All the 3 parts of this question are connected well, and I hope the rest of the courses of the Data Specialization is also implementing similar format.",4
93262,Really good course but it should be a little more interactive.,4
93269,Personally very fulfilling. Learnt all the basic stuff I needed to know.,4
93271,A little bit too muchMaybe five week is better,4
93277,Great way to ramp up on R.,4
93286,It would be nice if you could combine the lecture notes into a single file for download.,4
93299,"Very good introductory curse of R language, teaches you everything you need to start your own projects, shows you resources to start learning on your own.",4
93303,"This course was a good experience, but I wish there were more explained tasks of difficult functions and loops before giving difficult exercises. Also I find this course a little bit boring for me and sometimes very difficult (especially in peer graided assignment)",4
93307,Very well elaborated. Swirl is an amazing way to teach (even though is somewhat easy). Great resources.The tests could have been harder though.,4
93308,"Yes, this is not for beginners.The assignment since week2 is beyond what was taught in class. I have to pay another 25 dollars on datacamp and finish 10+ courses, spending 2 weeks at least. Go back to the assignment, without success. The learning curve is a bit tough. Anyway, I'm kind of newbie on programming, will continue learning this one.",4
93309,Kind of difficult,4
93313,good introduction to R!!,4
93314,Very enriching course. Steep learning curve for beginner in the assignments.,4
93315,This course is quite hard if you don't have some programming basics. Otherwise it is very fulfilling.,4
93318,Very good course.I would recommend others to go through this course.,4
93322,Assignments are not what we expected to be according to video lectures...,4
93325,Need more excercises,4
93332,"I only finished week one so far. My opinion (to the first week's content) is that it's a little bit hard to familiarize all those basic R concepts from scratch. Maybe the teaching staff would want to make it more concise so that before any real application (or simulation), students do not get lost in those technicalities. However, it's pretty great course. It's pretty detailed and informative.",4
93342,I think there is something not so important but occupys a large part of this class. Maybe you can rebalance the priority of this the contents in this class and replenish some introductions of more useful functions.,4
93344,Good introduction to R,4
93348,It gives you the basic idea of R coding. Swirl is very good. Homework 3 is a little bit tricky.Overall it's a good class.,4
93358,"I was initially going to give this 3 stars but it would have been a biased score as I found the programming assignments too hard otherwise everything else was great, so I've added a star to counter my own bias.The programming assignments for a novice like me who has only completed the Data Scientist Toolbox course (which was the only prerequisite as far as I know but may have missed this in the opening spiel) would have significant difficulty completing and comprehensively understanding the programming assignments in any meaningful way (i.e. to reuse the knowledge in a different context or question).I completed all of the videos, swirl programming tasks, took fairly decent notes, exams/tests and still had to look elsewhere for much more guidance than I would have thought necessary on the programming assignments as I found them too hard to do on my own. I am not that smart though and this review can only capture part of my own subjective experience.Other than that, as I really enjoyed learning about R and analysing data in general as well as the way Robert Peng's teaching style and demeanour I really enjoyed it. Trying to work out if my failure to understand and reapply is a lack of my fully grasping the material and if so whether to continue grappling with R and programming in general. I've started the third course of the specialisation so will give you more feedback once I'm done there.Thanks very much for the course and keep up the good work.",4
93362,"Overall it's good. And I think PPT may be much more helpful if there is a video of professor, and some animations.",4
93367,"It is a very hard class for anyone who has never programmed before, in order to complete the assignments you have to look for a lot of extra information.",4
93371,"Good exercises and challenging course, but very hard if you do not know any R beforehand.",4
93372,"This was a good class. The lectures were interesting. The swirl package was fun for the most part. And the message boards were actually informative and helpful.The actual programs we were required to write could be used for other things in business or health science, and therefore were practical.",4
93379,"This course tells me basic functions but if we want to learn it more specialised or proficient, it may let you down.",4
93380,It´s a good R course.,4
93387,"Very good introduction to R Programming. It would be especially good if at the end of the course there were some model answers, though I appreciate the problem of answers transgressing into the public domain!",4
93395,Good course to learn R who plan to or are into data science/statistical field.,4
93400,nice but not understood some topics,4
93402,Course is really great. However for the absolute beginners it might be challenging as the assignments and videos assume basic knowledge of stats and programing,4
93404,"Hands-on with the videos should be given, instead of cumulative long assignments.",4
93417,"I entered this course with no coding experience, and I can definitely say I am disadvantaged because of it. The lectures are great explanations of the different commands in R, and the projects are a great playground of R's different capabilities, but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures. That being said, this course's difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programming.Overall, I do not enjoy this course - mainly because it is very difficult. However, the course is structured logically and provides (what I assume the majority of students) a comprehensive introduction to R.",4
93425,Decent basic introduction to R language for those how haven't work with R or just need a quick refresher,4
93427,"R Programming has solid information and exercises on just that! However the videos and sections for each week are not very clearly structured. Sometimes the end assignment can take many times the number of hours the rest of the content in a week requires. I'd be careful about taking this course while working unless you can devote serious time to programming projects on your off days. That stated, the course is excellent otherwise.",4
93430,Course can be made more rigorous and exhaustive.,4
93445,it is really great! I advice it to anyone who is going to learn R,4
93453,Very useful！,4
93464,This course would be one of the plus point for the job I am looking for.,4
93468,"Great course for learning the basics in a structured , concise way.A bit basic but a great course nonetheless.",4
93473,Very much helpful to understand the basic about the R programming. Very well structured,4
93476,Good course to begin with.,4
93480,Strong intro to R,4
93483,Prefer More Sample study during the course.,4
93484,"its fun and well taught but i was having a little trouble understanding how to go about some of the topics here, this course being my first ever programming class i have ever taken. all in all i enjoyed every bit of it and its something i see myself doing in the future. Two thumbs up!!",4
93487,"Very thorough and appropriate level of difficulty. Less one star because week 1 is way too much to retain before you get to practice, and there's really no reason to lay it out that way.",4
93489,This course is a very nice introduction to R.I would advise to complete the swirl assignments as they provide good practice to memorise the commands. Sometimes it feels like swirl use a lot of positive reenforcement to the point of getting the impression of being trained like a dog.Still I felt a great sense of accomplishment completing the course.,4
93490,Assignments were difficult but would have been easy had I first been exposed to the material in later courses. Not sure why the specialization is structured that way. I'll definitely revisit my code for these assignments.,4
93491,Audited only.,4
93500,Great content delivered at a solid pace.,4
93506,Nice course and interesting material but the other students evaluation is quite subjective.,4
93508,Learned a lot from this course but for people without any programming background it might be quite intimidating.,4
93509,There is a large gap between the assignments and lectures.,4
93510,The professor expressed the concept really good and it is quite easy to understand.,4
93512,"Very steep learning curve, especially in the beginning.",4
93517,"Great course to start getting your hands into R. While the lectures are OK and the Swirl exercises are great, the course falls a bit short in building you up to tackling the weekly programming assignments. I had to spend a lot of time researching on my own to complete the assignments. I don't mind that, but I could do that on my own without paying for the course. I'm paying because I want to learn R quickly without spending hours researching what could have easily been described in the lectures. A lot of times, the course mentors in the discussion forums provided the best guidance. I would have liked each programming exercise to build upon the last one, so that at the end of the course I would have a great R product to review later. As it is, each programming assignment can stand on its own. When learning to programming in a new language, I prefer small, quick victories that build upon one another to accomplish a great task. This is the reason for not giving full 5-stars. Otherwise, Dr. Peng does a good job at providing material. And, be sure to check out his podcast, Not So Standard Deviations, to remind you that even people who have been in this field for years still find some areas challenging. It gives us R beginners some mental support.",4
93520,Only problem was the large gap between the assignments and lectures. Swirl exercises should not be optional as they are the most helpful part of the course.,4
93521,Very useful course. R from scratch. Thank you very much.,4
93522,"Nice cource, well explained material that is address.",4
93527,The course covers a lot of different topics related to R programming. I think the course explain a lot of important concepts. In my opinion the level of the videos too simple and is needed to do the practical part by yourself using swift in the console. This way you learn about what you need otherwise the class exercises are pretty complicated.,4
93534,Good Course. Learnt a lot. Thank you :),4
93537,Nice course but should have more practice exercises and Coursera should make interface more interactive.,4
93539,"A very challenging course for a beginner, but if you are ready to invest time and effort, you will definitely manage it. A point that should definitely be mentioned is that the course is not self-sufficient, so to speak: you will need to do a lot of additional research, googling, ask questions on forums and maybe even take additional courses in parallel in order to make it to the end. But once that steep learning curve is overcome, you will enjoy all the benefits and, above all, will be well-armed to continue in the specialization.",4
93550,Very good course. Cover the necessary topics.,4
93551,The course is so hard for whom who don't have a Statistical background. The number of submissions are too numerous for professionnals who have only the weekend to do tem all. The course's projects must be reviewed.,4
93564,There was some mismatches between what was thought in the lectures and what was tested as part of assignment.,4
93566,Good fundamental overview of the programming language. I also liked the pace of the course.,4
93568,It was really informative..but need more examples and more pratical view.,4
93574,It would be more useful if the instructors put forward more resources to practise the programming learnt.,4
93580,"Great overview. The Swirl exercises are wonderful for ""teaching a person to fish"".",4
93582,Support material is decent but some more examples in video lectures would be good,4
93585,"Although this course covers quite a bit of the fundamentals of R programming, you will need to use the web quite a bit in order to complete the assignments if you are not familiar with R. I could complete the assignments, but it took me a very long time, as some of the required R commands were not taught in this course (granted, if you are willing to fill in the gaps through google and the wonderful answers from all the guys and gals at StackOverflow, you can complete them, as I did). If you have no previous R experience, like me, but you can hold your own at programming,(me again) you can pass the course. If you have never coded, I think the course would be next to impossible; bear that in mind.",4
93586,"Excellent environment to get acquinted with R. Specifically the Swirl programme inside R is really helpful and will get you the basics of how you can work in R in a very efficient way.For me, as a clinical researcher, some more information on how to clean your data and run your analysis would be very useful but this course is mostly focussed on programming your own functions.",4
93589,I'm a fairly experienced R programmer and still learned a few things from this course!,4
93606,One problem is that the programming assignments are not much related to the corresponding lecture.,4
93607,"Assignments can be made better. They should increase in level of difficulty , rather than making them quite tough for first time R programmers.",4
93611,Awesome course,4
93618,Some disconnects between assignments and lectures but you'll find that in a lot of classroom settings. Otherwise fantastic content about the basics of R Programming and the environment thereof.,4
93621,Nice introductional course to R! I was only missing some illustrations that would enhance the understanding of the matter.,4
93625,Good intro to R,4
93628,This course is very nice for beginners.,4
93635,"It's a hard course, but very fulfilling",4
93642,very practical course to learn,4
93645,"Thank you for course! I really appreciate it, I've learnt basics of R. But I'd expect that there are more excercises and more features of R be highilghted",4
93652,"Great start to get into data analysis. A little difficult for 4 weeks, but manageable.",4
93654,The class experience can be enhanced if there is more console operation.,4
93665,Too challenging,4
93677,Overall it's a good course and I've learned a lot from it. But I think It'd be great to have more examples and context on how and why use those functions. To me R is a really quirky language and isn't really intuitive to use and it doesn't have a lot of functions that other programming languages have such as push and pop for lists. I remember spending like 5 hours trying to get it to work in a way that I'm more used to but then realized it could be done in a completely different manner. Most of the time I spend so much time on trivial stuff which I think can be avoided if more explanation is provided.,4
93679,Designed for everyone who wants to know the basics of R along with introduction on how to play with large amounts of data and get the statistics out of it.,4
93684,pretty nice introductory course,4
93689,"Easy to follow. Might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful even for those who have some prior experience.",4
93692,"So far, I don't really like R.",4
93695,really good course,4
93697,"The content was great, especially the swirl() library. The instructions were a little confusing at times, but the online advisors helped to sort it out.",4
93698,I am experienced in C++/C etc and some 50% of the videos i had to rewind.The assignments are really good though,4
93701,"A quick warm up course for new learner in R. I spent a week to went through the course material and most of the experiment/programming tasks. Now feel quite comfortable to basic R. The course might be improved if more time are spent on some concrete case studies. Some useful functions/routines like str, csv header preprocessing are very handy and it is great to learn these. The last part, debug and profile seem not big concerns for new learners.",4
93706,"Slides and videos are a bit insufficient in order to finish course projects.Apart from that, this course is awesome!",4
93709,"R Programming in Coursera is a great course. You will learn a lot about R and a lot about advanced programming. But you will suffer along the way. Every lesson brings tons of knowledge, and every quiz will leave you with the feeling you only knew half of what was needed. You will have to fill in the blanks, which is easier if you have previous knowledge of R and/or have previous coding know-how. From someone who had taken other R programming courses, I loved and hated this one at the same time. It's a great way to really learn R, but be ready to put the additional hours and reading required to successfully pass.",4
93714,"Good course, a bit too hectic for newbies but totally worth the effort.",4
93721,Excellent course; some parts were difficult some parts were not. A go,4
93723,Great course for a shallow introduction to R programming.,4
93725,The course gave a good overview of R language. The knity gritty things could have been explained better - for example the result of splitting a data frame does nor return a data frame etc.It wasn't for some one who had never programmed in his life.,4
93729,"This was a good introduction to R programming. The assignments were very challenging, and it didn't always seem like the lessons properly prepared you for them, but I guess they just required some ""hacking"" skills (the initiative to find your own answers, on Google, StackOverflow, etc.). The step-by-step optional Swirl R assignments were very useful.",4
93731,"Overall this was a good course. It does assume some prior knowledge/experience of programming, which makes some parts of he course challenging for a newbie. However, I would recommend it to anyone beginning the R journey.",4
93732,Too hard. I needed more programming skills prior to this course,4
93735,Very nice lectures.,4
93737,"The course takes more time and is more informative than the Toolbox course. The material in the videos is quite more basic than the material in the quizzes and assignments, but that should be expected. The only improvement I would suggest is to give lecture material on the deeper concepts involved in the assignments.",4
93738,R programming is good for beginner.,4
93748,This course should have more assignments of R Programming. Remaining are good.,4
93750,This course is a good starting point for learning the bits and pieces of R. It shows you how to work with data in a fairly easy manner.The course is well explained and the exercises are challenging.,4
93759,"Good introduction to R. Without my programming background, I think this course would be more difficult. For example, when I think I should use a switch statement in an assignment, I already know what a switch is, I just need to search online to learn how to do it in R. At the same time, speaking as someone who's worked in software engineering, a lot of any programming job is not about being taught everything but being taught enough to then go out, search online, and find out what you need to get the job done.",4
93762,"Bit unclear examples at times, scripts have excessive writing. Otherwise great experience :)",4
93774,Very useful and practical content.,4
93775,"A good class. Some of the concepts required a good deal of research to understand and use, but that research is really the heart of modern development anyway.",4
93783,"Pro: The course covers a lot of information and the necessary reference material to do the assignmentsCons: 1) This is definitely NOT a beginners course with no background with R. The assignments cover/test things that are not covered in class. Please don't advertise this to be a ""no experience required"" class. 2) The code that is presented in the lessons is overwhelming (read: daunting) to someone like me (with no experience). So it doesn't help when the instructor talks through the code. Please look at datacamp tutorials - If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have passed this class.",4
93798,"I would reduce the requirement of using Git. Otherwise, good course.",4
93799,Reading quickly slides,4
93803,Homeworks are more complicated compared to the class examples.,4
93806,Good introduction to R!,4
93821,Pretty decent course for learning R basics,4
93823,"I think more detail statements are needed on PDF.Because I'm not good at listening, so I studied by PDF.",4
93824,"Great course. However, more examples in the contents would be really useful.",4
93830,I think the video is much easier than the quizzes and assignments. There is a big gap between the weekly video and the quizzes.,4
93831,This was truly a challenging course if you're unfamiliar with scripts...in addition the course moves at a moderately fast pace but assignments are doable. Do the r (swirl) assignments.,4
93835,Very comprehensive course to get on track with R!,4
93841,"I did learn a lot from this course, i know where to find the resource to solve my questions.",4
93843,"I really enjoyed learning R and stepping up the skills for using R. I really appreciate this great opportunity to learn exquisite classes for free at home. I do think this is as amazing as the Industrial Revolution. It is the Educational Revolution!BUT it seems errors occur (in some assignments), and I feel the level of classes is getting higher/tougher suddenly. I feel overwhelmed and challenged from assignments in week 3.&YOU GUYS TALK TOO FAST. (well, it surprisingly didn't affect to my understanding though). PLEASE! like myself, there are many many ESL students taking this course. I really don't think my English is poor (trust me, my undergraduate major is English lit and i wrote my final thesis for master's degree in ENGLISH as an ESL) but sometimes doing assignments and understanding lectures were challenging...Maybe that's because it takes time to get used to all the technical terms that has nothing to do with my major or career so far. But I think, not just JHU, but all the good universities providing courses need to consider ESL students who wanna learn more and pursue their dreams.Also it will be really great there are more ways to earn some degrees and more support for using the knowledge and skills I learned here for my career. (with reasonable price!)Thank you for the wonderful course, JHU! Hope I can go to JHU in US someday.",4
93844,"Great course really helpful. But only 4 stars, because I wasn't really prepared for the 2nd Assignment (Lexical Scoping), based on the lectures, and the cache assignment operator wasn't well explained.",4
93848,Excelent introduction to the R programming language,4
93850,"Good course to start learning R,but still missing some explanations in the lectures regarding programming assessments.",4
93861,Really hand overview of R and common development practices in R. SWIRL is definitely the one that must be attended in order to get best understanding on the subject if no prior experience in R.,4
93862,"Very interesting, sometimes there's things that you have to figure out by yourself to go on.",4
93873,good. this lecture inspire me to work hard. study hard and think hard.,4
93874,Good course. Would have been great to see a few more examples to explain concepts but otherwise great flow and good support through swirl coding practices.,4
93878,Some problems with quiz,4
93894,"What's best in this course: the assignments. Requiring a short few paragraph essay answers to a few questions at the end of each week is so much better than just relying on multiple choice questionnaires. This encourages participants to do a little bit more, at least glimpse through a few relevant Wikipedia articles.Of course there is plenty of multiple choice questionnaires and videos as well. Some of the videos are a bit dated, but that makes them even more interesting as an archaeological evidence. Besides, the subject matter isn't moving forward very fast, though new research reveals new things at a slow yet constant pace.",4
93898,Thoroughly enjoyed learning more about ancient Rome. The lectures are a great overview of the history of Rome with great insight from the archaeology. I'm an architect and I really appreciated the connection between architecture and the culture of Rome. I didn't realize how much of a Archaeology rockstar Dr. Soren was until I watched the BBC documentary! Thanks to the leaders of the course and Lana.,4
93902,"Pretty good class.Dude, lose the dog, it's not cute, it's creepy.",4
93905,Quite a good resource,4
93906,Interesting content. Engaging instructor.,4
93912,Interesting and well presented. I enjoyed it very much!,4
93913,"I enjoyed the course. Lots of Roman history included. Lots of interesting videos from other experts in a particular area of study. But, I will never again take an on-line course with essay questions graded by other students. Out of frustration, I experimented by looking at the answers before taking the test so I knew I should have gotten a perfect score & still didn't get passing marks from my fellow students. I started just skipping them. Remove the essay questions & I would give this course 5 stars.",4
93921,"A very interesting and entertaining course!However, the dog could have been left out . . . .",4
93923,"Good content, but odd mashing of video presentations. B",4
93925,I loved this class but the only reason I have to give it four stars is the over amount of peer review assignments that are extensive. Otherwise it's great but be prepared to work :),4
93927,Just started today and have already learned a lot!!! Looking forward to next weeks lesson!!!,4
93931,"The courses of the first three weeks were more interesting to me because of their technical orientations. I was less convinced by the case studies presented in weeks 4 and 5. The Indonesia case study was very general, for instance, and the gender planning only one of many dimensions to be considered (what about cost recovery, maintenance organization, private sector participation..?). My view is that eawag should keep concentrating on the design and management of technologies, where it is excellent, and let the planning of development projects to other institutions. The planning of urban sanitation infrastructure and services, as well as any other urban infrastructure and services in developing countries, is a very complex task covering politics and policy, institutional, organizational, technical, financial and social aspects. Summarizing the success or failure of sanitation project planning to community participation and inclusivity is quite reductive. The very low level of success in urban sanitation development compared to other services in developing countries (such as telecom and transportation) is a sad indicator that ready made solutions and fashionable acronyms (CLUES, SFD, ...) are still very far from offering successful solutions for urban sanitation improvements.",4
93932,useful to learn about the most common sanitation technologies,4
93951,Very interesting,4
93960,Very good course. Some ideas are very impressive.,4
93968,fantastic course help u learning how to learn,4
93972,The content of this course is easy to understand. The approaches of effectively learning is very easy to learn and to practice!,4
93980,This was a tough course and I actually moved to another schedule. I think a sixth week on using excel to solve problems would have been worthwhile.,4
93986,"I loved it, but one suggestion please put more examples and videos to make it more interestingThank you",4
93987,it was a very good course insight.,4
93994,Give nice practical tips which are helpful for managers. Explain the hiring process. Share best practices.,4
93997,The course was fine but it should be more dynamic and engaging like the previous course (Preparing to managing human resources).,4
93998,"Very good. some lessons are not completed though, you should review the course",4
94001,Prof. Falink's videos had some editing and sound issues; in-video questions were poorly placed; quizzes had some ambiguous or misleading questions (3 stars); Prof. Doepner-Hove's project was a great way to apply everything learned (+1 star).,4
94005,I really enjoyed the course but would have learned more from concrete examples or case studies on the onboarding pro,4
94007,Really useful information and checklists to help new managers successfully bring on team members. Thanks!,4
94009,"Lots to learn, and it was presented in a very easy to follow format.",4
94010,Very interesting,4
94013,It was great that reading/video materials were provided during the course. I found them really helpful.,4
94018,very good course but the last part ( on bording ) need to be better,4
94030,Good insights on Hiring and Onboarding Employees and the key to this course is the best practices followed and how differently we think when onboarding a new hire,4
94034,Amazing and very educational!,4
94035,Great course for people managers. Does not walk away thinking this is for HR only.Onboarding part is particularly awesome.,4
94041,"Really intresting! I learnt a lot and now I have the opportunity to understand more things about recruiting, hiring and onboarding ! Thank you very much",4
94043,This course is really useful for Hiring and On boarding purpose,4
94044,"the materials and videos are valuable,",4
94048,Good but the part of AB testing is really neither motivating nor exciting forn IMCA,4
94059,I enjoyed the course.,4
94060,"The course is insightful and teaches real-world application of some social media strategies. However, it is not enough by itself; the specialization as a whole will be useful.",4
94065,"This is nice! Cool interviewers, nice pace. Some of the terms are unnecessarily redundant, but in overall they make sense and paint a clear picture.",4
94079,"Great Content, PLEASE FIX MY credit for course.",4
94086,It is a great course for the basic understanding of FB advertising and what a social IMC is and its importance in social marketing.,4
94089,I am very excited about this particular assignment - great instructors means great instructions !!,4
94096,Great. Easy to understand and very practical.,4
94109,excellent course in terms of content and pace. nicely designed course that gives you a complete understanding of the subject.,4
94114,"Of course there are several contents in few lectures, but I think it is a good course that help you to get started with the sale process. The speaker, Craig Wortmann, is pretty passionated about the topic.",4
94122,"this is the best way of learning, the language was easy to understand",4
94125,very helpful but i finished it and there are no results to see!,4
94126,its a great course to learn sales but its doesn't include the process of generating leads and there is not much support from mentors on the discussion forums.,4
94127,very useful module for those planning to pursue serious sales career.,4
94136,"Very good , well distilled and concise.",4
94147,"Thanks Craig,You made this very useful and immediately applicable by the way you taught and of course the content. Great work. Appreciated.",4
94152,Been really helpful.,4
94157,"This course is an excellent survey of introductory sales techniques and thinking. In addition, it allows you to access Craig Wortmann's ""Sales Toolkit"", which I think is highly valuable and able to be carried over into other personal/professional situations. However, the rigor of feedback from classmates was sometimes lacking, and the problem sets/videos took hardly any time. More time could be spent on them, but without more intense feedback from seasoned sales professionals, it might not be worth the investment. Overall, I am satisfied with having paid for this course in order to get that feedback and the certificate.",4
94161,This was the first Coursera course that I have completed and it was excellent from start to finish. The quality of the content was high and the workload was what I would have expected for a course like this. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to enhance their existing sales knowledge or to develop this weakness in their skill set.,4
94169,Craig is such a professional sales-teaching that I learnt a lot from him. Now I'm confident to start pitching potential leads that might fit my business. Thank you!,4
94184,"Very Good Course, Professor is very clear and Motivated.",4
94185,Great course with practical lessons and advices that can improve your sales skills.,4
94186,"Subtitles are not in sync, high quality and neat teaching",4
94191,good course,4
94197,Very good summary of strengths/weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms. This lecturer's style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series.,4
94199,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers",4
94201,"very good, but if it has swirl practice like th other courses it would be perfect.",4
94202,"So why four stars vs five stars, of all the Data Science Certification courses that I have taken: i) some of the examples and quiz challenges don't work as they should, ii) Machine Learning is rapidly changing area - should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of Deep Learning, iii) posting the Final Project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses - this should be cleaned up - still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link - requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs. a project name.",4
94204,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning.,4
94205,Very good course. The content can be enriched with some more technical details behind the various techniques. There needs to be 1 more course on Practical Machine Learning in the specialization as 1 course is far too less for such a vast topic.,4
94211,Great course! The hands-on approach make it very useful for one to start doing some very interesting analysis in real life! Thanks a lot! You guys could only make some efforts in updating some classes and packages used in quizzes. But the rest was great!,4
94220,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data.In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion. In addition to course lectures, i used the 'Machine Learning with R' book to fill my knowledge gaps. Overall i feels that this course helped me in my journey of gaining a better understanding of this subject.",4
94221,First 3 weeks are manageable and the final project is great! I had a lot of fun :),4
94231,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!,4
94237,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.,4
94239,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R.Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained.As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning.But at least, learned a lot.",4
94245,"Great intro to machine learning. Several algorithms with some ideas on sampling and pre-processing techniques are covered. Adding a textbook as done with some of the other data science classes would help, but other resources are referenced.",4
94246,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.,4
94249,"Lectures were not very detailed.Quizzes were good and challenging, but too many times the results didn't match the answers even when the random seed was set rightFinal project should have been more challenging with more models to build and compare",4
94253,It's a great course but I hope you add a few things. The course about the machine learning algorithm is so basic. Please get deep into the machine learning algorithm. Then it would become the perfect course.,4
94258,Nice Course for every New candidate,4
94261,"Was pretty good, but quite short and some assignments did not align as well with the lecture material as they could have.",4
94265,"Rather basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package.",4
94268,"Nice course, Gives a god insight on what can me done with R and Predictions",4
94271,"Great course, very demanding, but it could use more reading material, ebooks instead of links on video.",4
94272,"Unlike the rest of the modules in this specialisation, this one was well taught, a good blend of theory and practice and well paced.There were still a few issues with wording in quizzes (and some where there seemed to be two identical answers to one question, where one would be considered right and the other wrong - purely chance). In addition, the lack of consistency in how to submit assignments across the specialisation is frustrating, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a way to show how to use github or something like that, but it shouldn't be the case.",4
94274,"It's very cookbook driven - it's not a deep dive into the topics. This can be dangerous: a little knowledge and all that. However references for more are provided. If you can imitate the coding examples, you should be OK for the assignments. Fair warning: the quizzes are hard to replicate unless you set up your environment to mirror exactly the version of the packages used in the course.",4
94275,"Very enjoyable and generally quite understandable introduction to machine learnings with hands-on approach through the course project. It was a bit too fast-paced and generic for my liking, but many options were offered and highlighted for finding additional learning documents and courses to be able to deepen the knowledge acquired in this course.",4
94278,"I learned a lot in this class. There are slight gaps from the depth of material covered in the lectures to the quizzes and assignment. If you're good at researching online, you'll be fine.",4
94280,Just the right level of detail,4
94290,introduces lot of machine learning techniques which are used by practitioners !,4
94291,This course allows you to implement practical solutions using machine learning algorithms without having to know the mechanisms behind the calculations in detail. Unfortunately questions in the discussion forum were quite rare and many questions were not resolved during this course.,4
94293,"Great course, very high paced with a lot of information. would have been great to add two more weeks and another project to use more machine learning",4
94295,In my opinion this course is highly technical and demanding in nature compared with the others. The learning experience is good and coursera.org has given a opportunity for customization ! thank you Coursera,4
94298,Title says everything. Practically and basically no theory explained. Good course though.,4
94299,"The course is really great, however it should last a little longer, 4 weeks is hard to accomplish",4
94302,Very informative course.,4
94317,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources. As an overview, this class works well. You can expect to learn a bit about what machine learning is and how to to do it using the caret package in R.",4
94318,"Of all the JHU Data Science specialization courses I've had, this was by far the most enjoyable. I really liked how the class was more in the style of 'here's some techniques, now do whatever you want on the project.' Prior courses are, and understandably so, more constrained in the assignments. It's not until here that the student really has the tools to be able to flex their analytical muscles, and it pays off.Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others.Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes. If you're hungry for more after this one, I highly recommend UWash's Machine Learning specialization.",4
94320,Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.,4
94326,"Nice, other courses will go more in depth though.",4
94328,"Great Course, will be nice to have more projects to see how it goes with different data",4
94329,"I liked the course and found it informative, but wish there were more stuff on unsupervised learning neural network algorithms (SOMs). Learning about most used algos are great, but would also like to know other machine learning algos that are used concurrently.",4
94333,Really Well Structured Course!!,4
94335,"Good introduction to machine learning, might suffer a bit from trying to cover too much ground in such a short time.",4
94345,"Pretty good overview of how to build some types of machine learning models through the caret library in R, but not much in terms of the theoretical underpinnings or why one method is better than the other or where it is most suitable.",4
94347,Fast paced and little focused on the algorithms but quite useful overall.,4
94354,A good course where you can learn how ML algorithms work practically.,4
94359,Very good course. I am very knew to this topic but am sure will find a lot of application in my speciality - geophysics,4
94367,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises.",4
94372,"First and foremost I'm so thankful for the exposure to so much material in such a condensed schedule. Very good class. Even though I had to muscle my way through it.I think the class could be improved with one additional discussion thread for the project.A guide similar to the ones created for Inferential Statistics and Regression would also have been very helpful.I benefited immensely from reading parts of the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"" while taking this course.",4
94378,Really good overview of machine learning techniques and model evaluation.,4
94379,"Thank you for inviting me to be a beta tester for Practical Machine Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this year. When I was asked to be a ""beta tester"" I thought that I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The video lectures, quizzes, and assignment are the same as they have been for quite some time. Here are some specific comments:1. The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow. However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the specialization to other moocs that I have taken including Machine Learning with Andrew Ng and the Stanford Online EdX Course Statistical Learning with Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, the somewhat cursory treatment of the topics in the Data Science Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of ""truth in advertising"" this course should be called ""A Brief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning."" In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an undergraduate degree in economics and an MS and PhD in psychology with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses, especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and regression methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in psychology because researchers in this field like to measure latent variables. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also, there have been may new developments that have become more accessible through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not available when I completed my PhD. Thus these courses (and others such as the ones by Ng and Hastie and Tibshirani) have helped me to keep abreast of these developments. So they are good for me, but I wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science Specialization actually make a person a ""data scientist?""2. The quizzes: I think these items are good practice and are at a reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a few new ones added. A little googling will lead you to the answers to these quizzes posted online. I recommend that you put a little time and effort into writing all new items.3. The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous iterations of this course. And again, numerous write-ups for this project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people to analyze. This would help minimize some of the rampant cheating that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.On the subject of cheating, when I was doing the peer grading for the courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students that I was grading into the Google search box and all too often I found links to submissions for the project by students who had taken earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these earlier submissions by other students and submitting them as their own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying other people's work line by line, character by character. I found that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of course, if the instructors would change their assignments once I a while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. As it is, it appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the ""autopilot"" button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that other students have made would be helpful.Overall, I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and specifically this course. I know that these class materials took considerable time and efforts to create. I wish the instructors continued success with these classes.",4
94380,A good introductory course for people who has an interest in knowing the principles of machine learning and want to make a step forward. Sufficient details covered throughout the course and additional resources were provided which are very useful. Quizzes were well designed with minor improvements in the accidental mismatch of the answers due to package version issues. Overall the study experience was enjoyable and would definitely recommend to someone who wants to start knowing data science.,4
94383,Massive Improvement on delivery compared to course 6. I would suggest to take the t,4
94384,Some lab work (swirl()) did not match the material presentation order. Essential coursework delivered at a blistering pace. Good Stuff.,4
94385,good course,4
94388,"Great course, although feeling as always a bit rushed on the last lectures. At least it makes you want to investigate more about the subject.I find frustrating however not to have a proper instructor example of the final assignment, it is hard to review other participants work and realize what they / you have done wrong without actually knowing how best the assignment should have been fulfilled.And as all courses in this specialization, there is not much interaction between participants, and not much effort by mentors to animate it",4
94390,2 thumbs up,4
94393,Great introduction to regression models. Pretty clear,4
94394,"The concepts are well explained and precise. I think it depends on the individual to dive deeper into the topic by independent learning. Good data examples. Also following the suggested book of the author helps with some extra excercises. However , I feel extra practice questions would help .",4
94402,"This course was an improvement in teaching modality from the statistical inference course, with more polished content, but the link between the lectures and the actual exercises was still a bit strained. Overall, it felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the swirl exercises and the lectures, and this led to a lot of self-teaching.",4
94405,Very good material but often too fragmentend/messy. The notes would need re-writing.,4
94409,Content regarding variable selection is kind of rough.,4
94413,A little monotonous sometimes. Otherwise good.,4
94417,This is a great course. The content clearly explains the regression model.,4
94419,"This was better than the statistical inference course, but Brian still puts too much emphasis on the precision of his language (as if he's teaching to other mathematicians) which makes it difficult to understand. I would like to see a bit more dumbed down explanation of the mathematics in the examples (similar to Sal at Khan Academy). If that happened, this would definitely be a 5 star course.",4
94422,"This course is much improved, when compared with Statistical Inference. The instructor have put much effort in making the lectures interesting and casual, at the same time not loosing the value of contents. I especially liked some subtle jokes - just a finishing human touch.Some lectures from 4th week were not very well rehearser and shot hastily. Some quiz question were disproportionately difficult, but most of material is covered in course or course materials. Otherwise the course is very educational.",4
94424,"I was hoping to learn about PROBIT models. I know they are very similar to LOGIT ones, but still... the pace is a little bit too fast and I think it requires more time than what it says.",4
94433,"Regression models was almost just as difficult as statistical inference. Again, the swirls and exercises were of great help. The pace, as always, was quite fast, but in the end all the pieces fitted together. Congratulations on a job well done!",4
94434,"Like the way the Prof uses media. This is a very light touch on a very deep subject so it has to balance analytical work with the light ""trust me and just do it"" approach. The balance was mostly there although on a couple items I don't know that I had a good enough grip to know what I don't know.",4
94436,Something was missing from this course. I cam away with an increased understanding of regression but I still feel like I struggle with many concepts and had to put in much more time than the recommended.Still when I found the answer it was all still contained and maybe the material itself is just advanced.my 2c,4
94445,"Great course. The content might be improved to be more clear. I feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses. Also, some times he does a very good job explaining the WHY before the HOW, and some other times he does not. Very knowledgeable instructor.",4
94448,prerequisites are very mandatory to do this course,4
94449,"Great course to learn various regression models and ""R"" tools to implement them efficiently, butwas little hard to keep with the deadline.",4
94450,"Sometimes videos were hard to understand, especially in week 3.",4
94452,"To me, this is by far the best course in the series. It deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science: regression models, residuals, measures of the quality of the prediction, etc. The teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting. He is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.Highly recommended. It doesn't get five stars only because it covers only the basics; I would have really liked it to last twice as much!",4
94457,It is a good course for learning regression model implementation in R. You may need to have a basic understanding of popular regression models like linear & logistic as the course doesn't cover mathematical aspects in detail,4
94465,Good course. My only negative remark is that I really missed the swirl exercises that were available for the other courses of this specialization.,4
94482,Advance topic in regression model.,4
94487,Great course.,4
94492,"This course will give you a good basic foundation in regression models. However, do be prepared to do a good amount of work besides just viewing the videos. I would recommend at the very least to go through the exercises in the 'recommended textbook' to gain a better understanding.",4
94497,Very intuitive course,4
94499,"Videos were very difficult to follow along with. Overall, I learned a good amount though.",4
94515,Good course. Prof. Caffo is a great teacher! Hope to see an advanced version of RegMods soon!,4
94525,It is a great introductory course into Regression analysis. I highly recommend it!,4
94526,This was a tough class covering a lot of material. The last week on logistic regression completely lost me. If you're new to stats like me you might want to take it more than once.,4
94527,"First 3 weeks give very reasonable overview of the subject - topics of linear / polynomial / multivariate regression are covered quite well.Week 4 is a bit sloppy and ad-hoc, comparing to first 3 weeks - GLMs are given poorly.",4
94530,I expected more in Binomial Regression and Poisson regression,4
94532,A decent overview of regression,4
94546,"This is the best course of the bunch so far. These courses are really promising -- I've learned a lot from them and they probably have everything they could have at the price - but I'm leaving just one star off because I feel very strongly that some effort could really go a long way to making a better language map of these courses. A person leaves this course, and even more so the inference course, not being very clear one where their new capabilities lie in the spectrum, and without the strongest sense of how to experiment with linear models.One case in point of the the huge strengths and a slight weakness of this course -- Professor Caffo mentions the wonderfully tantalizing fact that the application of linear models can get you most of the way to the top of a Kaggle competition. That feels true, I trust him, and it's really cool. But it would be SO. MUCH. COOLER. with an article showing a linear model attacking that kind of problem.",4
94556,"I enjoyed the lectures and content. I would have liked to see more use of clips. The quiz format (select 2, select 3) is not one I find effective and often leads to the creation of ""trick"" question through wording that don't really assess conceptual understanding. The same is true of history class questions of the old school - recall a name, date or place.",4
94560,"Though a little dry at times, this course is extremely informative and provides examples of every main topic it covers. I also appreciate that each lecture is broken into 3 segments, for when I have limited time or attention span.",4
94563,The cource was very informative and easy to follow.,4
94571,"Although the form of lecturing is quite limited in this course, I still found it attractive. Just if you are interested in the topic. Information quantity is just enough, and well organized. Tiny quizzes are there for you to recall the things that you just listened to. I like it and hope there're more courses about Nordic culture and social system.",4
94573,"Very interesting course, helps understanding of a number of Scandinavian television crime dramas that have made it to the UK.",4
94578,"Thank you to the instructors and the university! A very interesting course that not only focuses on the content and quality of Scandinavian TV and movie productions but also on the broader (institutional and cultural) framework in which they are produced. I would have rated it 4.5 starts if possible, but as halves are not possible I give it 4. Possible improvements:-the delivery of the course can be a bit livier, smoother; some instructors seem a bit at unease with this format-while an interest in Scandinavian movies and TV series is an implicit prerequisite for a course like this, sometimes simply mentioning 'lists' of directors, movies, series you might never have heard of can make it a bit overwhelming, hard to relate to-students' engagement could be enhanced with more interactive assignments",4
94579,"Very descriptive, educational and fun as a filmmaking course. It teaches the various prospects of film in denmark, sweden and norway among scandinavia.",4
94623,"To get this out of the way: The one star deduction is not related to the content of the course, only to the fact that there is occasional imprecise language and some parts of the material have typos and grammatical slip-ups that show that the course has room for some tightening up.That being said, the selection of topics that are covered is great. You get a small but full package of both knowledge and tools that'll help you to significantly (no pun intended) improve your research. Not only are statistical pitfalls covered and solutions offered, you also learn something about how to approach your research with the right mind-set in order to produce solid empirical knowledge that contributes to a cumulative science.I was particularly impressed by how the instructor manages to pack lots of important topics and concepts into his 10 or 15 minutes lectures without it becoming overwhelming. The key to this is his ability to maintain focus and his generally clear and concise language. The course material, too, reflects the ability to present just the right amount of information - not too little, not too much.Overall, the course feels very pragmatic and hands-on. It proves that good and fruitful science is doable and that you can start right now. It makes you *want* to start right now.",4
94629,"Dr. Brooks makes a great professional instruction by constantly citing the research which supports the statements she does in the learning materials, as mentioning when there is no research, or this has resulted confusing upon the statements she is doing. The course provides a detailed summary of key aspects of the science of training young athletes in a fair depth, tests often include feed-back which can clarify concepts whether you get the answers right or wrong, and all materials are organized in a logical way. In my opinion, the course may improve by adding readings, instead of pushing every insight in a lecture, which results challenging to remember or completely understand sometimes. As well including case studies instead of an essay as the only written assignment may result more pragmatic and interesting. Finally, elaborating on the feed-back received after tests, pointing to the learning materials containing the information, and doing more specific questions for the forums may encourage more effectively learners to participate! Thank you so much!",4
94644,Awesome course,4
94646,Interesting course but the lectures are lacking in imformation. I would recommend as long as you don't mind a,4
94651,Course is interesting and provides basic knowledge of the subject. But often the tests require more information than provided in the questions or lectures. Also very less help is provided in the forums.,4
94655,"The course was very good, but I guess there were too many quizzes, and the instructions / questions in the quizzes and other assignments are not unambiguous. That could be improved. Other than that I liked the course and the specialization very much.",4
94662,"The course was very good overall. I just wish if there was a little more mathematics involved. For the rest of the part, it is pretty good for beginners and enthusiasts in Robotics. Hope to see the advanced version of it sometime too.",4
94663,This is one of the very first courses in Robotics in which in legged robots are talked about. And from this course I learnt some very significant factors to consider when working with legged structures and the mobility in them.,4
94671,"The course provides good exposure to the problems in legged robotics.The course lists multiple references to the books and articles, reading which is necessary to make this course more useful. I wish some more time would be devoted to dynamic models, including kinetic and potential energy calculation of the SLIP and other models. But one can find this kind of information elsewhere, for example, at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhk9xLjrmi4 and http://ocw.mit.edu/2-003SCF11",4
94675,"This course helped me identify my interest at the intersection of biomechanics and robotics. The lectures were very motivating which gave a birds eye view of the background and research in mobility of legged robots. While watching the lectures, I expected programming assignments involving simulation of dynamics and control of the templates and further perform compositions with them but didn't find them much. In a few assignments, the wording of the questions was ambiguous or the grader accepted only certain answers; hence, consumed a lot of time. However, the TAs were very helpful in clearing most of the doubts very quickly which also made solving the assignments easier. Further, it provided references to abundant resources to steer the student in the right direction to pursue specific interests. Overall, this four-week course provided a very good intuitive understanding of the dynamics and control of legged mobility in animals and robots.",4
94676,"Interesting to learn about how and why robots differ from animals. The material was relatively easy to digest because the lectures were well paced and at the end there was a summary of the content. The quizzes are intelligent, so the course is not a give away.",4
94678,The course served as a great introduction to legged robots and the templates that anchor them. The teaching staff was also very responsive to questions on the discussions forum which was immensely helpful.,4
94688,"Once again, great ideas to teach!",4
94710,Great Course,4
94715,I found this course gave me great tools to improve my classes. Being a teacher is not something easy but with practice and great professor like the ones in this course we sure can give better things to our students.,4
94718,It is a really interesting course which you can learn easily. It provides different listening techniques to use in every day class with your students.,4
94727,nice course I really learnt a lot,4
94758,Good historical overview. I especially liked the 'case studies' of the various European countries during the 40s. The literature part included some very good reading and interesting movies. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic o,4
94772,"Fascinating historical, sociological, cultural, and literary journey through the Holocaust and the years preceding and following.",4
94787,Well structured and presented course. I enjoyed the course. Thank you,4
94792,Very clear explanations and right to the point.,4
94794,"The content of the course was pretty good, probably lacks the practical usecases of it.",4
94802,"Great introductory course on popular software development practices. Some peer reviews could be added in this course to make it more interactive. The course has become heavy on theory side and lacking practical side. However, it is a great place to start learning basic software practices. I, personally, learnt a lot from this course and I would highly recommend this course to all the software developers out there.",4
94806,"Great class, very hands-on and practical. Applying it every day in my PM practice !",4
94808,"Good, basic overview. They pronounce Kanban wrong and it drives me a little crazy.",4
94811,Very informative and practical course.Thanks faculty and team.,4
94812,5/5 if there were more pictures and diagrams of the methods while they were talking to better visualize.,4
94817,Very interesting overall view on the different processes and methodologies of software development.,4
94831,"I really like the company narratives. For this very overview presentation, it would be helpful to see more of these.",4
94834,Good topics,4
94838,good course,4
94842,Examples would help distinguish the nuances between the processes for example the use of the Microsoft daily build. Great comprehensive course otherwise.,4
94845,Good material.,4
94849,The course is good but the end of unit quiz are not accessible unless you pay.,4
94850,very well conducted. Nice overview of the theory and practices. Would have been good to have some examples and case studies (more like the Microsoft daily build.),4
94865,"Good overview of agile practices.If you're doing the specialization, they say you can take courses 2 & 3 in any order. Technically that's true, but my recommendation is to do them in order.They refer to course 2 in course 3, and the difficulty of assignments decreases if you do them in opposite order like I did.",4
94873,Without reading the course notes it quite difficult to understand the lessons and pass the tests,4
94877,It has been very useful as an introduction to agile concepts,4
94878,"Simply listening to somebody talk about the fundamentals of Agile, with no practical work whatsoever, could be an extremely boring experience. Thumbs up to the two people delivering the contents, because they both managed to do that in a very engaging way. Thanks!",4
94885,"Good explained course with interesting information about processes and practices in agile. Not too detailed, but can give you an overall overview of what a process implies and what are the general practices used in software.",4
94890,"Great production values and more ""meat"" to it than the intro course. I like the scenario based questions. It still seems a little light on content, but the content that is present is good.",4
94891,Nice overview of different practices and methods.,4
94894,A very detailed course. Recommend it to all those interested in becoming practitioners of Software Product Management.,4
94896,Great Course,4
94898,This is a survey course of software development models and as that it is fine. Did expect more depth though.,4
94912,"I found this course interesting, yet I would propose to rename it to ""Introduction to Software Processes and Agile Practices"". Topics are covered well, but they don't dive deep.",4
94915,"Very informative and cleared up a lot of questions I had about processes, agile, scrum, kanban and how they work together.",4
94916,Its a wonderful course for enlightening anyone on the basics of Software process and Agile. Very good lectures!!,4
94919,"Interesting, ""agile"" and complete. The quizzes are of a good level.",4
94925,A very well organized and presented course with relevant content.,4
94932,"Nice introduction to Agile and Lean methodology, should probably cover more about Lean",4
94934,I think it would be better if more real-word case studies are provided.,4
94935,Pretty broad introduction to some different processes. Gave a pretty good intro to agile methodologies. I like that there was some depth in the explanation of Kanban. Looking forward to continuing in the specialization.,4
94936,"Good introduction to many core concepts. Overall video and presentation quality are quite good. The course is not particularly challenging, so if you are concerned with time requirements, I don't think you need to worry.",4
94939,"Good course! Excellent to reinforce my knowledge on scrum, xp and agile. In the end however I think that the content was somehow repetitive, but this not change the quality of the course.",4
94946,good but abit brief,4
94953,Interesting course and wonderful speech. Requires some mathematic and computational basis.,4
94955,"Learned many things from it,Great!",4
94957,"This course was helpful in motivating me to do some serious introspection and providing tools to assess my soft skills; my core values; my career interests; and my competencies. I especially liked the first three weeks of the course, where the instruction and exercises were clear, coherent and inspiring. In weeks 4 and 5, the instruction became a little muddied, but I still found the exercises very helpful. Overall I would definitely recommend this course to anybody struggling in a job search or wanting to make a career change.",4
94965,"Lots of value in the course. If the tutors didn't read from their notes, but instead would speak freely into the camera, it would be even more engaging and personal.",4
94967,This is one of the very useful course.,4
94971,"An absolutely great course that transformed my career development efforts from uncertain and uninformed to focused and well thought-out. The topic lectures were relevant and practical and CDLs were challenging yet inspired deep introspection and evaluation which assisted to internalize the concepts and convert them into actionable tasks. Many thanks to Amy and Drs. Forte, Valeri, Rutigliano and Beckem.",4
94981,These professors took a brave approach to discussing topics that are avoided in the classroom but merit discussion. It was a well balanced course that doesn't shove you into a particular corner but instead offers multiple viewpoints and questions for you to consider about your own personal beliefs.,4
94986,"Thanks to the beautiful and long journey of reflection and beliefs about the soul, we do together with Prof. Daniel Ogilvie and Prof. Leonard Hamilton.I really congratulate you for your animus, interest and great provision.Sow concerns ...to reap virtues.Sincerely.",4
94990,"Great, but with less new content than Units 1 and 2.",4
94991,This course worked better as a guide than it did as a course. I learned very little from the lectures and had to do most of my learning on my own. One of the assignment even explicitly told students they would have to go learn on their own.,4
94997,"frankly, it takes a lot of searching information on one's own, outside of this course.I raked my brains for the most of Saturday and Sunday and finished two last assigments although I still don't feel strong in pandas, neither there is much material left here for me to come back and review something step by step in a systematic way.",4
94999,Great course! Some of the homework questions seemed a little ambiguous but I was able to find clarification in the course discussion. All in all I learned a lot.,4
95003,"Tasks sometimes a bit tacit to understand what exactly should we return and in what format, but course is great!",4
95005,Good course to get you thinking about python,4
95006,"Content was generally well covered. One improvement could have been slightly better examples of how there are multiple different ways to solve the same problems; the instructor would often allude to this but would just advise the student to read through the pandas docs, which could be non-intuitive at times.",4
95013,Good course the assignments were challenging,4
95014,Very good course with some challenging assignments that put to test many of my python capabilities,4
95017,The teach and assignment are not in line in difficulty levels.,4
95019,"course material good, mentors very very helpful and active , as mentioned in one of the posts the expected output of an answer in pictorial form can help students a lot , and the assignments were a little on the tough side , even being from a programming background i had to put a lot of effort to figure out silly mistakes and complete this first course but a nice experience , keep it up coursera.",4
95025,Gave me a thorough understanding of Python and Data Science. Thanks to the team! :),4
95029,"Great learning experience with a very good teacher. A little bit difficult but, hey this is science!",4
95036,"In my opinion, the assignments problems could be more clearily explained, I think it could be improved for next sessions.",4
95039,A worthy course to begin Python & Data Science with. I enjoyed learning Data Science in Python.,4
95046,This is the good course for learning data science,4
95050,"Sometimes need more words in tasks, so it can help understand it better.",4
95054,This is a good course if you have had some experience with the Pandas module in Python prior to taking the course. Pandas is a very powerful module but it has a fairly significant learning curve. There are all sorts of free Pandas tutorials available on the web. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics of Pandas prior to taking this course or you will probably struggle.,4
95059,"hard assignments, lecture was not enough to cover assignments.",4
95070,"Hope that lecture videos could be longer. Anyway, it is a great course, I really learned a lot.",4
95072,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting. Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors.,4
95075,The content is good,4
95077,"Great course and valuable information, but frustrating autograder.",4
95081,"The course content is great. However, basic knowledge of python programming language is required. Since I didn't know python coding rules, I really struggled for a while. Maybe, basics of python in additional resources will help a lot of learners.",4
95082,"I feel the videos could have been more instructive.However, the level of assignments is incredible! I learnt a lot more from programming assignments of this course than videos.",4
95083,I would like to have seen more detailed teaching on Hypothesis testing and how it applies to python before tackling the final project.,4
95085,Will be useful to take the Phyton Cpurse before this one. You only learn when you do the assignments.,4
95091,"I really enjoyed this challenging introductory course, I cannot wait to continue the specialization",4
95097,"requires too much self-learning,could be overwhelming to those who lack concrete python basics",4
95105,"Felt like this course was trying to pack a lot of information into only four weeks. I find Python to be a very frustrating language - at least that's how Pandas feels. Compared to R the syntax is dreadful. And I found myself digging through help files and FAQs to find ways to do what should be the simplest things - like accessing values in a data frame. The Pandas help documents are not written for beginners, but written in a mathematically precise manner that makes them inaccessible. (Their preference for 1-letter variable names is unhelpful.) Stack Overflow is much better but it's a crap shoot as to whether somebody has addressed the exact issue that is bothering me at any given point.One final issue: it would be nice to see model solutions. I understand the difficulty in having online solutions available for an online course, but I found myself writing what I considered to be inefficient code fairly often. Would love to see slicker ways to do these tasks.",4
95108,"This course is difficult. It stresses a lot of core skills in pandas and python. I wish there was more instructor support for the times that code just doesn't seem to match up with the grader's expectations. There is still a question in the course that I am relatively positive I answered correctly yet did not receive credit. Overall, the format is incredibly well done and the use of Jupyter notebooks makes the tasks very approachable.",4
95110,Thank you for the very elaborate and very beginner's course. The difficulty quickly ramps up and the questions within an assignment often differs substantially. This can be seen as both a pro and a con.,4
95111,it is a 5 star course but I am giving it a 4 star primarily because of the pace was very very fast for me...,4
95114,"Some topics are very difficult since many of the concepts are outside of what was thought in the lectures so one has to do a lot of research outside of the website. This takes up a lot of time and is way more than the estimated time for each part of the course. I did find excellent help available on the forum. Overall, a very challenging yet fun course.",4
95116,"Great Course,very practical. I would improve the examples and increase the number of exercise during the lectures instead of just fastly presenting the pandas functionalities.",4
95117,A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course.,4
95124,"the knowledge touch here is really good. however, the speed is a little bit quick. I paused and go back and forth usually.the last introduction of assignment 4 is not clear. I took quite a long time to figure what to use to calculate the price ratio and what to use to run ttest.",4
95129,the content was more focused on just pandas librarycouldve included matplotlib and scipy also,4
95133,"This python is mostly an introduction to the Python Pandas API. It teaches everything by example, but at very fast pace, and the videos are really just preparations for the assignments, which can easily take more time than specified.",4
95134,right course.,4
95135,"The submission tasks are too time consuming. In the other hand,forces the student to search about answers by themselves and use the techniques taught on it's full extension.",4
95136,"A bit short, but good info. I wish you got access to an optimal code for each of the assignments once you submit yours and pass, so you could see how you can improve.",4
95138,"Great course, requires much self-initiative because not all useful methods for the assignments are covered in the videos. Sometimes Assignment Questions are not described very clearly.All in all I enjoyed the course very much :)",4
95139,Not for beginners.Level of difficulty increase very fast.You need to dig external reference sites and use discussion forums in order to figure out some assignments requirements.Overall quality is very good.Should have some better tips and validation scripts in order to help debugging assignments.,4
95143,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework.",4
95155,Perfect to get hands on with python programming for data science purposes.,4
95162,"While the course was great, the Jupyter notebooks and the background shells gave me several unnecessary errors. While this was a smaller issue, I think the practice Notebooks should be somewhat in line with the assignments. I struggles on Assignment #3.",4
95164,"Very good class - but it does require quite a bit of outside study - reading up on stackoverflow. But after this class, the student will be able to have a very hand set of tools/skills to tackle datascience projects. BTW, python with the interactive notebook is very popular in actual datascience projects in the commercial sphere, so this class can be leveraged directly in the real world",4
95167,"The course was structured well, there were a lot of assignments that really help with learning pandas. The lectures were ok, could've been a bit longer though.",4
95170,"I took sometime to get used to the auto grader, but after that it's fine. All the staffs are very helpful in clarifying the questions and provide code to debug my codes. It was awesome!",4
95177,Nice course. I really liked how I could proceed at my own pace. The computer-graded assignments were very helpful and the Forums were good sources of info.,4
95178,"This course has greatly helped my understanding of not only some python, but pandas as well. My only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it. They give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a week's worth of material, but this can vary highly from person to person. Overall, I enjoyed!",4
95186,"Overall this was a great class. The programming assignments were the most valuable part of the course for me and were good practice for wrangling data with pandas. I did find some of the assignments asked questions in a way that were confusing and it was difficult to debug the answer based on the automatic grader. However, I'm looking forward to when the rest of the specialization is available, as this looks like a good track!",4
95188,"The course is very good to introduce people with pandas usage, however, the autograder and little data issues on the assignments costs a lot of learning time.",4
95191,Please make longer tutorial videos. Sometimes it becomes too fast to cope up with.,4
95192,"The course is great and learned a lot from the assignment! I just feel some of the content is a little beyond me since it took a lot of time to finish.After finishing the assignment, I feel myself haven't done enough! So if possible, I hope more exercise can be posted here :)",4
95193,Nice course for understanding the basics,4
95195,Overall a very nice introduction to Python. Sometimes the checks for the assignments were a little annoying. It would be way easier if all the checks would be published from the outset.,4
95197,Course is good. I learned a lot. But the pace of teaching is very fast.,4
95198,Assignment time estimations were way off in my opinion.,4
95201,"Don't think this should be classified as ""Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required."" Need at least some coding experience.",4
95202,"Very well structured course. I would really appreciate if there are more video lectures. For someone like who is not from CS background, self-study topics can get really difficult.Apart from that loved it.",4
95207,Was good but the support in the forums could be better.,4
95208,"Basically assignments were unclear (I had to do lots of resubmissions), but everything else was fine.",4
95209,Very interesting subject and data science skills are definitely currently in demand. The only thing that bugged me was that the grader didn't give much feedback on anything you did wrong. On the flip side the mentors did a GREAT job (kudos to you guys). The discussion forums were vital and they were really well moderated.,4
95210,"Nice course! there is only one suggestion I want to send you, the video is so short that we can not learn the pandas more in the course. So I hope you can provide more detailed videos thanks.",4
95217,This course will be a great start for people to know about data science with python and get familiar with few simple data.,4
95219,The assignments were challenging and cool. Lot of self-study needed to crack them. The lecture videos could have been a bit more interesting.,4
95226,"The course content is great - Prof Christopher seriously made justice to the content. He is great instructor. He has presented course in right manner, with right speed.Looking for more courses from Him.",4
95228,"All the ingredients are there, but it would be nice to have more hand-holding given the ramp-up in difficulty in only a few weeks.",4
95229,It was very hard but extremly learnful.,4
95234,"A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course. Many were passed onto ""look this up yourself"", which is fine, but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong. The group_by stuff was especially tricky, as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example, eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns. Other than that, very interesting overall and very neat datasets. I would encourage having students check out kaggle.com for extra credit.",4
95235,"Really good course with challenging assignments. However, the grader has some issues, for every assignment I had to spend more time trying to figure out how to make the grader accept my answers than actually solving the problems.",4
95237,The material seemed a bit hurried at times..but overall a great learning experience and the assignments were truly helpful,4
95241,"Good course, if a bit fast paced, expect a great deal of searching through documentation and stackoverflow, but it is to be expected from an intermediate level course.",4
95246,"This course was great to get a start in Data Science. I thought the lectures and the course notes were very well presented and served as a good resource for the assignments. The use of Jupyter notebooks was especially helpful. I found the course forums also very helpful in debugging my code. I have some previous experience with Pythons so the level of the assignments was easy enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed, but challenging enough for me do a lot of independent study.A criticism I have is that the Jupyter notebooks kept logging me off so saving assignments regularly failed and I had to redo work often.I usually don't pay for courses on Coursera, but the quality of this was so good that I will definitely continue with the specialization.",4
95248,"good when it's been around for a while, else frustrated with a lot of unclear instruction and no support.",4
95250,"It's great course, but the assignments are so hard to data science beginner.",4
95259,"It was challenging yet fun to learn this course.Last but not least, the http://stackoverflow.com is really helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to learn Python.",4
95261,Good at setting up the framework for the assignments. Google/stackoverflow is your friend. The course materials presents the information but you will have to go and actively learn a good amount of material. I enjoyed this approach but some may be looking for a more contained course.,4
95263,First two weeks are great. The third week becomes a bit disporportionately difficult. The autograder is very inflexible.,4
95271,"I can see a couple of problems in this course. How to access and change elements in a data frame (especially the use of loc and iloc) is not explained very well and I believe there is an error in the slides. The second thing is that I have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation, for example assign() or nlargest() and nsmallest(). This is not really a problem if one of the ""hidden"" purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to do.Work load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion, not too little, not too much.Overall I am satisfied.",4
95274,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this.,4
95279,Finding optimal solutions for the assignments would have helped more,4
95281,"The content and the instruction were great: just the right level for someone like me with experience in other programming languages a decent familiarity with stats.There were a few glitches with the auto-grader for the assignments, but nothing to onerous.",4
95298,The instructor should lower the speed,4
95299,"The course is challenging, and designed to encourage learners to be independent and make full use of the discussion forum. As long as learners do not lose sight of the fact that help is available, they will enjoy this course. But if they lose faith, this would be a disaster.",4
95304,"In general, this course is able to introduce the basics of data manipulation in pandas. Exercises are designed in a way that key python functions can be applied. The downside is, I feel like the grading some what less intuitive. For example, in may assignments, student has to import pandas or numpy in each and every function in order to get the score. Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear. Students may not get the full reason for certain errors, thus creating challenges to improve their homework.",4
95305,Requires most projects to be completed without the videos help. Need to research and find answers elsewhere. Also need to have good sense of python.,4
95322,"Great course for data preparation for ML which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignments. Assignments require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Dr. Brooks for putting this together.",4
95325,good solid intro to python munging.,4
95327,"Great course, it would be nice to have more interaction and feedback from TA's.",4
95329,It's really nice to learn pandas in this courses. Every assignment is full of challenge for me.,4
95335,"As compared to some other machine learning/data science courses offered ""Introduction to Data Science in Python"" was very pragmatic. Starting out with simple data cleaning and data structuring may not be the most exciting thing ever, but it was extremely useful to learn the basic tools needed to be a competent data scientist. One point of warning - the homework and projects took me about twice a long as suggested by the course notes.",4
95338,Nice lecture. Needs to have more videos and more advanced tutorials,4
95341,course was good but teaching material was not enough to complete the assignment,4
95343,"Quite a fast-paced course, with very quick and packed lectures. Would have preferred the course to be slightly longer e.g. 6 weeks and covering more content. I actually found the style of the coursework to be a plus - though it involved a lot of Googling, this is more reflective of real life, where answers aren't just handed to you on a plate. However, the instructions for the assignments aren't very clear in places, which can easily cause you to become stuck.",4
95353,"Very challenging course yet very informative. I am looking forward to the rest of the courses in this series.A word of warning: if you are not familiar with statistics, parts will be very difficult. If you are not familiar with Python the whole course may be very very difficult.",4
95357,Course should be more interactive and details,4
95359,"Great course, Gives good outline to navigate through the essential content",4
95369,"After having taken several Data Science-related courses, this course seems like a good introduction to Python for Data Science applications. Not much 'actual Data Science' is covered in the course, however. It's more practically-oriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation (loading, cleaning and merging data). You don't get the luxury of the common perfectly-prepared csv-files in this course, which is a good thing!",4
95371,"I think the structure of the lessons are highly relevant for data sciecne and taught well. So for Syllabus content I think you are doing veryy wellCons: Nearly all the problems I encountered were related to the autograder not being helpful! There could be better error handling/debugging i.e. instead of just saying the answer is wrong, explain why and the aswer that is expected. For example, I spent DAYS on the final question (run ttest)of the last assignment. I had the right answer all along except the autograder was expecting the type to be numpy float 64, whereas my answer was just a float!",4
95372,This was a good course and quite challenging. It requires a lot of self learning if you are not familiar with pandas. I wish some of the technics that were required to solve the assignments were better explained in the course material.,4
95374,I recomendIntroduction to Data Science in Pythonit is a good piece of knowledge,4
95376,"It is an interesting course. I would say this course expects more from students than other courses. It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas. For the assignments you will spend a lot of time in the Pandas documentation and Stack Overflow. I don't know about others, but this lead to my code being very clunky and not Pandorable code.",4
95383,"Pretty good course. I have definitely learned a lot and would like to thank you the lecturer and all the people who were working to create this course. The only comment I have is following. Please, try to formulate the questions more clear in the homework assignments. The assignment # 4 is especially bad in this sense. You can look at the comments of people in the forum to understand that it is not just my own problem.",4
95385,Assignments needs slight polishing. Otherwise course delivers what it promises.,4
95386,Spent more time figuring out what was being asked in the assignment rather than solving the assignment. Typos in assignment questions led to wasted hours without understanding why the grader kept rejecting solutions. Course content was useful and I would recommend if you are willing to live through the pain of the assignment submission.,4
95387,"Good for Beginners. Assignments are good but question framing was poor. Of course, required doubts are clarified through Discussions. Overall Great Experience doing this course. Thank you!",4
95388,Very nice course. The only problem that I found was the lack of exercises between assignments.,4
95390,Very good intro into how to use Pandas for working with data sets and get insights from your data by using various aggregating functions and statistical tests.,4
95396,"Although I had some background with Python and Pandas, this course brought new insights in both. With practical examples, it reinforces the conceptual understanding about working with data. I highly recommend this course even if you are already familiar with Pandas",4
95404,"This course was much harder than anticipated given it was also my first introduction to Python. Knowing Python coming into this course will make it a lot more manageable. Overall it's an excellent course which touches upon a LOT of items. Given more time on each item, this course could span 10 weeks easily. I now have an understanding of Python basics along with Pandas and a dash of numpy.",4
95414,"This course is accurately advertised as requiring intermediate programming experience. It focusses on some of the basic python tools that are used in data science like pandas, specifically dataframes. For a python newbie like me, some of the assignments were quite challenging as they required significant additional reading and search. I would have appreciated if all of the concepts required to solve the assignments were introduced in the same week, so my additional reading and search would have been more targeted. Very little stats if any is required or taught.",4
95415,"I thought the videos for this course were appropriately concise and well-done. The projects were about the right difficulty and length (although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected). They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the ""right"" ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed. I'm sure I didn't use the optimal pandas approach in some instances, as it stands I seem to have no way of knowing and improving my knowledge beyond getting a passing grade.",4
95416,"Not so easy ,not too hard!",4
95417,Good content - some prior knowledge of pandas is important.,4
95418,"Good course, going a bit fast on certain aspects but good use of Jupyter and interesting coursework, challenging enough.",4
95419,Good lectures and a good introduction to the subject matter. Definitely requires additional research and practice is weak on Python and the Pandas library. The comments in the auto grading could be more helpful.,4
95420,"Good introductory course, but I must admit that the assignments are not explained well enough.",4
95426,"Completed the course and found it pretty good for the first run. Mostly focused on the Pandas library - you'll be ok if you know a bit of Python, or have experience in another language.Looking forward to subsequent courses.",4
95427,"assignment is really hard, takes me 30 hours at least",4
95435,"It's a good course over all. There is only one thing that I would like to suggest, which is that the autrograder does not seem to work well. It really wasted me lots of time to get the RIGHT ANSWER understood by the autograder.",4
95437,Very good... but question should have been properly explained (in a detail manner).. overall it was a great learning experience,4
95439,"Lectures clear and well-organized. Homework needlessly complicated and with large gap from lecture material. Grader did not give enough info when rejecting submitted work. Weighting last problem at 50% of final week was unpleasant. Hosted platform allowed importing re and io.StringIO, but grader rejected them. Hosted platform had consistent kernel failure on my last solution, but it worked on another system and grader accepted it.",4
95444,"Contents are very good and assignments are challenging. Perhaps I struggled most trying to understand what the questions actually ask, they should be rephrased or be more clear. But it was a nice course and I would to it again. I am waiting for the next courses to begin.",4
95446,The course was really great. Thank you!Sometimes precisely what the questions were asking weren't clear (This may have been resolved by a notebook upgrade but I did not realise this until it was too late) and I did have some issues with the autograder. Otherwise would be five stars.,4
95448,"Autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback. Could improve the feedback mechanism, maybe with peer review. Thanks for the course!",4
95460,Learn a lot with Pandas.,4
95463,"Great course, assignments take more time than listed, and I found the discussion forum very helpful to learn more about the assignments and interact with other classmates. Overall I learned so much of commands from this course.",4
95464,The assignments do not have clear definition and guildlines. It is very hard to see what's getting wrong in the submission.,4
95473,"The course was great - the lectures were clear and simple; I learned a great deal! However, instructions for the assessments could have been clearer, and there were a few issues with the autograder (though I'm sure those will be weeded out).",4
95476,"The course is good and provide great challenges to do a lot of things with Python and Pandas. However, I find that its resource material sometimes lacking complex examples. This may be intentional in order for the students to learn from external resources as well. However, this can also causes difficulties for people who are not already familiar with Pandas before they start following the course.",4
95477,"Great! Even for someone with some python / pandas experience, it was a nice refresher / found new tips / tricks. I actually enjoyed the fact that the assignments didn't hold your hand and forced students to solve problems with the forum and other resources. Look forward to the rest of the courses in this specialisation!Two aspects you could improve is teaching is (1) Multiindex and (2) Regex. It seemed like you purposely avoided discussing these. These should be a mandatory subjects to learn.",4
95478,"The theory and examples are very good and cover a lot of functionalities. I like most the questions that pop up in the middle of the videos, it is a great way to check whether you understood the concepts.Some parts require refinements, the questions in the middle of the videos must be synchronized with the content (there is a little time gap) and the questions in the weekly assignments must be reviewed in depth, I dislike wasting a lot of time trying to understanding what is required to answer in each question.",4
95479,This course is a challenging (and solid) introduction to using python.,4
95480,"This was way above my level knowledge. One will definitely a strong level of knowledge in stats and data analysis to begin with. The Python part is but only a tool in this module / course.For that reason I found the tutorials way too fast paced. I had to go back on everything and test, so a 5 mins tutorial video would sometimes take me 30 mins or longer to complete.The 3 hour / 4 hour assessments took me days!Yet - a great way to jump into something new! The course itself is great. The presentation and content is just as great.",4
95481,I like the course very much. It was fun to learn and to do the exercises. There were some rough edges in the assignments but I'm sure these will be straightened out in time.,4
95487,"It is useful, but there are some notable flaws. My biggest problems were with the clarity of the assignment questions (some were unacceptably vague) and the feedback that the autograder gives. Fortunately, fellow classmates on the forums are extremely helpful in figuring this all out.",4
95491,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data parsed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected.",4
95495,"Although the tests can be a bit fiddly, this is a great course if you already have a bit of background with Python and/or data cleaning. Lecture and tutorial videos are lean and information-dense.",4
95499,"Excellent course, I learned a lot especially through the assignments. Missing a fifth star because of a lot of issues with the notebooks autograding, and sometimes imprecise instructions in the assignments. Still I look forward to working on the next pandas courses!",4
95502,Pace of lectures is rather fast and doesn't fit to homework level (which is much harder). But overall course is OK,4
95508,Take this course if u can invest a lot of time in searching for stuff yourself. Content and videos are okay but the assignments are very tough,4
95510,Great course.,4
95513,"A great intro to pandas. Challenging even for those with experience using the library. There were some struggles with the autogravder, but they were being worked out, and the integration of the Jupyter notebook system directly into the class is fantastic.",4
95519,"To be honest, I think the course is very good, however, it may be need to more clear on the description of the questions in assignment.",4
95520,Great pace for intermediate level people.,4
95525,"Thank you Mike, for providing such a Course! When I looked for Courses on corporate sustainability, I found less than expected. Hence, being happy to have found this. I really enjoyed the Course and I strongly recommend it. And for someone who had already dealt with this Topic before the Course, the Content could have been Little more detailed and comprehensive. But since the Course addresses not only People who deal with the Topic on a regular Basis, obviously it is understandable why it is designed like that.",4
95530,THANK YOU!,4
95541,"This course was helpful. I will not be using everything I learned, but I did like the comprehensive calendars so I have continued to use those.",4
95543,This has helped me to stream line my planning both at work and at home. Many take away ideas that I still use.,4
95545,"A simple easy course, but to the point and effective. I recommend this course.",4
95548,Very detailed and helpful. It helped me decide for my present method.,4
95560,This was very useful. I used what was taught and had my most organized year ever! Thanks,4
95563,This really helped me even though I am not a teacher,4
95569,I took this a year ago and I still use the strategies! I loved it.,4
95579,"I liked it! I think it can be finished in a much shorter time, though.",4
95582,wonderfull'i recommended for new teachers or persons who wants to put and organize everyting by planing,4
95585,It seems to be focused on creating calendars and that's useful.,4
95598,It helped me alot to get organised and know I can do way more than I could do in my limited time. BTW some tasks were just impossible to achieve,4
95613,This course is very useful for teachers to get organized.,4
95616,"I'm not a teacher, but found many aspects of this course very useful to better organize at work or in my free time.",4
95625,Should also exist for no-teachers : everyone needs a good organisation!,4
95627,Simply great!!!,4
95630,"Nice course. I already use most of the tricks. However, I get a lot of more ideas.",4
95633,"The course is a very good guide on how to get yourself organized following the Together system. The videos are not overly long, the assignments are directly related to the approach and system they are trying to guide you in. This works well for in-service teachers.",4
95642,Very practical tips on how to set up a system that will help you get your you know what together as a teacher. This is the paper-shufffle crazy-making side of teaching. I recommend it!,4
95673,"Great course for sports coaches, PE teachers and anyone interested to pursue a career in sports.",4
95691,This course is an overview of String Quartet music. It provides some nice resources to get to know certain composers or quartets better. It helped guide me to some nice music. The instructors are knowledgeable and do a good job imparting some of their insight into the lectures. The level of detail is about right for my time and attention span.,4
95692,good and useful course,4
95698,Very good and wide ranging performances. The insights were interesting.,4
95707,A very good introduction to the wonderful world of string's quartet.Thanks a lot.,4
95709,An excellent course that opens up a new world.,4
95711,"I enjoyed the structure of the lectures. For me the composers stories, the analysis of the narratives and the musical fragments were extremely interesting. Without an extensive background on music theory however, I had some difficulties following the musical analysis of Mia sometimes. However, I learned a lot, and am really grateful for your effort to put together a course in which you presented so many great composers in an attractive fashion to a large public, without losing the grandeur of the music.",4
95712,very emotional,4
95716,This Course is fantastic!!,4
95717,"The course is very good and the instructors are very communicative! The extra material is also very good, you have the chance to listen to so many compositions, which is very important in order to understand the touch of quartets. Personally, I would like to have some more advanced lectures and to be provided with the music sheets of the great composers in order to analyse them and learn from them! If Curtis is planning to organise a more advanced course, I would definitely join!",4
95728,Good course! Learned from others.,4
95733,very difficult! requires high levels of intrinsic motivation,4
95737,I liked a lot when examples are given but I missed going into some deeper thoughts on what are the ways and tools we can and should use.,4
95738,The assignments for this course are more hands on than course 4,4
95745,"Excellent practical course. I consider assignments to be more valuable than any lectures, though maybe in this particular course I could welcome a bit more theory and even better — more user case details.",4
95748,"I enjoyed the lecture of Ms. Gerber. She has a very clear-cut way of explanation that truly draws me in. However, some of the concept in this lecture is taught without complete examples, so often time I find myself a little puzzled doing the assignment. Also, I would appreciate more chance to do more assignments to fully master the topic, though I understand the limit of a MOOC. Nevertheless, nice course!",4
95751,I really like this course assignments.,4
95753,Very clear course with many exercices and a good combo with the other courses of this specialisation with the introduction of a different teacher,4
95754,"Highlight of the course was the interview with the IDEO researcher. It's great that you have actual people from the industry bringing their knowledge to the table, I really liked that.On the other hand, I think the course was in general too easy compared to the academic level of the previous courses of the specialization. Especially the assignments were not requiring the same amount of work / proof. For example conducting interviews would just require some written summary while previous courses required actually to record a full interview to soundcloud. I think the course was especially missing the assignment on prototyping, which would be really important. It was kindof just skipped and we students were not asked to actually build prototypes. I think the course should be harder and request more effort from the students.",4
95757,The course is very good.,4
95767,"There could have been more content and the course been more challenging, otherwise loved it!",4
95768,This is a basic and introduction course to user experience and prototyping. The projects every week are pretty interesting and useful for you to think like designers. I hope there will be more detailed examples of design techniques in the video.,4
95772,"Very good course, as a standalone course, some sections are slightly too short, but the information is great, very useful, nicely presented and works when put into practice. Thanks!",4
95779,cool,4
95782,Useful tips and relevant business case.,4
95787,A very useful course!,4
95792,Very very informative course for the beginners like me!,4
95793,"It's a great overview, but somehow i didn't feel like it stuck even though i did put in effort to read the articles assigned starting halfway through the course.Maybe it's because there's so much material that will be covered in a hands on part in the 3rd and 4th parts of this specialization... Would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in biotechnology and systems biology.",4
95795,"Great course! The only change i would ask for: after the test, could you let us see the correct response to the questions we got wrong? Thanks!",4
95801,a bit to hard for an introduction cours,4
95812,great introductory course. i been able to apply these concepts in my work.,4
95813,"Great Course! However, not so happy with scoring methods",4
95832,The content was very good and informative. It just that I couldn't relate the later part of the module as I have not been a part of any industry as such.,4
95839,"My first course on Coursera was Fundamentals of Business Strategy, by professor M. Lenox. When I saw this course coming, I had no doubt I have to take it. I like it for being short, compressed, professional and straight to the point!",4
95842,Very useful course!,4
95857,This is a great source for new ideas in how to built fine products.,4
95868,Good course. Few things towards the end of course were not quite clear to me.,4
95869,Course is good and they are working hard on having advisors available.,4
95914,"Very well made, great contents. The only reason I removed a star is it seemed to me there was more topics in the quizes than in the course itself in the first part. It was a bit confusing and the quizes required to look up information on the internet and there was no real way to know these topics would be in the quizes. Otherwise, I enjoyed the class and learned a gread deal.",4
95915,"Excellent course! The content is great in quality, quantity and structure!! 5 stars to that! However, I am giving 4 stars since passing the course or not depends mostly on Extension Exercises, which at the beginning seem to be optional but they in fact mandatory.",4
95924,Easy to learn with general concept within the business strategy's knowledge.,4
95934,Great course - learn a lot,4
95947,It was an insightful course which looked at key strategies most often ignored by social marketers. Randy did a great job on that excel sheet for the capstone project! Thank you.,4
95960,Very good course. The only thing that i'd like to mention is that sometimes the enunciate of the exercises is not so clear.,4
95963,A very informative course. You don't need to have any previous knowledge on the subject to understand the terms.,4
95976,there's a lot to learn.,4
95980,"Contetnt is great, however sometimes it was really hard to listen presenter and see repeating gestures that confuses and not clear where is the main point.",4
95981,"Very insightful course, broaden my horizon over the new age of strategy formulation.",4
95982,Amazing course. Anyone can learn if interested. Appreciative lecture. Thanks.,4
95983,"Great course , It has a lot of topics you can use in the future that will help you improve your company's performance.",4
95984,Excellent case studies very helpful in demonstrating theories,4
95988,There were the occasional moments when I had a hard time clearly understanding what the lecturer meant. Otherwise pretty good.,4
95994,"Teacher is good, also the contens are very interesting. However i felt the capstone must be clearer in order to follow the previous one. They have both the same situation, but there is something missing between capstone 1 and 2. Maybe it is the way it is conceibed, the questions were not clear at all.",4
95998,good concepts,4
95999,Excellent course building on previous learning . Excellent case studies,4
96000,"Good introduction to the basics of strategy formulation - includes some basic concepts in defining strategy, a few concepts related to strategy analysis and strategic decision making. Course ends with an opportunity to demonstrate learning objectives through a capstone case on E-Types design agency.",4
96016,A very good follow-up to the strategic management course in the strategic management specialisation. I had fun learning everything.,4
96019,"This is excellent course, the only reason why I am rating 4 stars because it does not allow you take the quizes",4
96027,Great quality lectures and fun real life examples! Would be even better if more structured background literature was given and more connections were being drawn between coursework from different weeks.,4
96029,It was a very good experience to take this course. Thank you!,4
96032,"I only dislike the fact that wasn't very clear the instructions for the final project, every work I reviewed and also mine, were very different, I think that everybody understand a different thing, and that wouldn't happen if the instructions were clear.",4
96038,Great course with good material and lecturer,4
96043,this course learn a lot of thing to me and give me many new idea,4
96047,"The course material should be provided on coursera itself. Instead of having to download a 1.8GB dataset from yelp, the two files could have been shared here.",4
96052,This is an inroductory cousre tou,4
96054,"Interesting course, could have added a bit more on how to write basic scripts or more ways of social media analytics",4
96055,"Tips you into the direction of great resources, but sometimes lacks in the explanations, leaving most code not explained. Not a deal breaker, and a worthy introduction but a more detailed explanation at times would help.",4
96062,"This pedagogy course is great, but I think it is missing real students learning the current lesson... I feel that the students try just one, and make it perfect, they already know... The teacher could show us how to eliminate their difficulties... Almost 5 stars!",4
96065,I loved this course. It helped me very much and I'm grateful for everything I learned here.The only thing I think need to be improved is the evaluation system.Can't wait for my next course!,4
96081,"Nice,i think bootstrap not too hard to understand.",4
96084,I found the material was good and the instructor was engaging. I appreciate that he tries to make learning hands on. Overall I found this a great introduction to Bootstrap. My only criticism is that at times I felt like I was only copying and pasting code rather than really learning the material. I ended up copying and pasting plenty of tags that are never really mentioned or explained.,4
96093,Good Course,4
96111,So Userfull and funny course. it's very good if you want to leard front web UI developer.,4
96122,The lecturer's narration is a little embarrassing...,4
96127,Super Awesome!Thanks!!,4
96130,Good content! Lengthy but informative!,4
96150,Very nice! Some things I felt that went too fast but in general it was great!,4
96155,A great course to learn about bootstrap if you are a beginner.,4
96161,Needs more practical examples.Like project for free.,4
96164,"I was able to learn Bootstrap effectively from this course. The assignments were good practise. However, reviewing other peoples assignments was a bit annoying, as their files had to be downloaded and put opened in a browser and it was a bit of as tedious process. The teaching style was good.",4
96166,Very well delivered. I do believe however that the peer review may sometimes let certain details slip through and as a result the learning experience might be not as good as it could be.,4
96170,good instructions,4
96173,A good course to getting used to how things work and being briefly exposed to the tools available.,4
96176,It is always fun learning in Coursera! Professor Muppala made it even more interesting.Thank you sir!I feel more hands on assignments to have a better understanding will be more exciting .,4
96177,"It was an excellent journey on Bootstrap. The instructor, Mr Jogesh was really helpful in taking us through the course giving a strong insight into the bootstrap world. This course has given me a confidence in building a responsive website UI ahead. Hoping to enhance the knowledge in the coming courses in the specialization and build a strong career as Web dev.Thank You, Sir!",4
96179,"It'a really good course, well explained.My only observation would be that it's really frustrating that you cannot submit your work, just because you didn't payed for the course.",4
96182,"It's always tricky to create a course on a framework, since it's always updating itself, but this is a solid base if you think you can't manage to learn everything on your own and need a place to start. After this you'll be familiar with the concept of UI frameworks and therefore will be easier to learn them in the future.",4
96183,Great course for learning and understanding Bootstrap.,4
96186,"Professor Muppala thank you, you really taught me a lot",4
96192,I was a really good course. However some of the assignment tasks could have been a bit more complex (For example week 4).,4
96196,awesome course with very good practice but explanation need to be more enthusiastic,4
96216,I reminds me what I did to my previous company. It is like a brush up and the instructor is good in delivering the content.,4
96224,"Thank you!Some of the exercises were not that well explained, but with the help of the forum everything was doable.",4
96238,Good lecture for knowing Bootstrap!,4
96247,"The course is good. It helps have clarity around Bootstrap elements, and covers basics on things like Less and Sass. At the end you will not be a super expert, but you will be able to understand how to build a basic webpage and how to use support elements like less, sass, and package management tools.",4
96248,"Fantastic course , well taught and explained with great examples.",4
96251,"It is amazing how we learn on Coursera courses. We have build a solid atarting point on Bootstrap framework, understanding the main classes. We are already able to build something real web design.",4
96254,"I like most of them, but I think it is kind of too many contents",4
96257,very clear and organized course,4
96258,great to understand basics of Bootstrap,4
96281,The course offers good material and covers the minimum requirements of bootstrap. The additional resources provided by the instructor are great for futher reading. The problem is the instructor delivers the material in an organized way but he is very slow.,4
96282,"The course proposal is very good, but the material and the examples need to be improved.",4
96287,This course is really useful for beginners like me. But. sometimes i feel like fast forwarding the course. It was too slow in the middle.,4
96298,i'm really glad i took this course most especially when it comes to bower et al. Really really glad for the opportunity. thank you,4
96311,"nice course and good instructor. but talks too slow, I completed whole course at audio speed x1.5.",4
96316,This course can be a bit dry at times. But still very informative,4
96317,awesome course...,4
96319,Great intro to bootstrap. I feel like more bootstrap features and web tools could have been covered.,4
96321,"老师讲的很好，就是有些拖沓。实验部分希望老师在最后可以给出源码。A good course, good teacher, except that sometimes the teacher is kind of slow. And I do really hope that teacher could give us the final codes right after every exercise.",4
96323,"This class teaches you the essentials of Bootstrap v3. It is by no means a complete course on Bootstrap, but it will teach you how to use the main components effectively.",4
96324,"The full course should be available to everybody with the assignments, only the certificate should be given to those who have paid for the course.",4
96325,"If you're expecting a decent tutorial on Bootstrap, this is the course for you. If you're expecting a course on fundamental UI design and implementation concepts, you might be a little disappointed. Overall, well presented with a fun restaurant mock web site as the final project.",4
96327,Last assignment does not have full instructions on how to complete it. Otherwise a good course.,4
96333,Now for me bootstrap is more clear.,4
96342,"I enjoyed this course and felt it to be a good introduction to Bootstrap.The time allocations were not realistic, though. I have a fairly strong (albeit outdated) background in programming and web design, but I still felt that I spent a lot more more time than what was allocated for learning. I imagine that this can be very discouraging to beginners.I am looking forward to the remaining modules.",4
96348,"This bootstrap course is very nice , every components are explained nicely. Assignments also good. Waiting for next angular js lecture",4
96361,Nice class,4
96365,This course gave me the fundamentals to start with the development of responsive web sites. The learning process is well supported with some exercises for each reviewed topic.,4
96382,Overall a good course,4
96386,Thanks for this course it is very useful.,4
96388,Its been an interesting course,4
96391,"Enjoyed course. Wish the review questions didn't include 'ands ' (both had to be right for a 'Yes' and pts) . With many ways to solve problems, these 2-part questions didn't always fit. Sometimes a peer had one exactly and then did the other part a different way that worked just fine. They make it harder to grade people. In most cases, if it worked I said it was good-to-go.",4
96395,"A informative class with a great instructor. Teaching is mostly through videos but their are exercises each day as well, which I appreciate (I'm a hands on kind of learner). The assignments at the end of the week are challenging in that they usually ask you to learn something from a 3rd part website or take what you know and combine it in ways he hasn't shown you. While that might be difficult for some I find it refreshing. By the end I feel that I know the breadth of bootstrap and have decent skills to implement basic websites with it.",4
96396,"I'm enjoying this course. Material and themes covered by professor are very useful to anybody involved in web development.Maybe, I will try to improve the way we review peer's work.",4
96397,Very well planned course.,4
96401,"A very good course, working on one large website project. The lecturer talks a little slowly, but makes things very clear. Some of the review criteria for the assignments are wrong for example ""div-xs-12"" should have been ""col-sm-12"" , which makes fair grading difficult at times.",4
96406,"Great Bootstrap course, sadly it's mandatory to pay to get a feedback with the projects",4
96411,Well defined and covered topics.,4
96416,good intro to bootstrap,4
96417,"Good course, but a little expensive to participate. it's terrible that i cannot submit the assignment.",4
96419,This course content is very good! but i got stuck sometimes because some program installation is very annoying(ex... bower...).,4
96451,"Good content, and covered a lot in a short span of time",4
96456,"+++ PROs First ++++ Pretty in-depth discussion of bootstrap+ You may watch the videos at 1.75x or 2x speed; you would enjoy the course a lot more+ You learn a lot towards the end of the course+ Homeworks were pretty good--- CONs ----- The bootstrap lessons are pretty much copy pasting code-- Week 4: Web Tools could be a little bit longer with even more examples about grunt, and Yo (we didn't see any example use cases on those topics)",4
96458,"At times the homework requirements are not well-detailed, comparing to the grading instructions.",4
96464,I love the course and thanks Coursera to give me the chance to attend the course for free.,4
96465,Excelente thank you,4
96470,great course,4
96496,Good but the assignments are minor changes instead of full blown impls,4
96503,"Course is great, but I putted 4 stars because of missing hints for assignments. It will be great to have such hints in this course.",4
96509,"nice class, learnt a lot",4
96511,great course,4
96523,"Awesome Course. One of the best courses ,i have been part of on coursera.well paced, very rich in content, very good delivery of the ideas,.Assignments very good. A value for timei just wish practice quiz to have more number of question, and more challenging.A VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO JOGESH. THANKS A LOT",4
96530,like this course very much. you will learn a lot,4
96534,Anybody who wants to develop a basic understanding of bootstrap or node.js should take this course.,4
96535,Very interesting course and very pleasant Professor !,4
96565,"The course is pretty well structured and the exercises were explained pretty well. It was pretty easy to follow the steps and do the assignments, but sometimes required a little bit more explanation on what does what, and why sometimes even after following his steps, our website might not look similar to what he has done on the exercise. One thing also if possible I'm not sure if carousel is pronounced ka-ruu-sel in Hong Kong, but it's Char-uh-sel like the ride, which to me was quite annoying to listen to.",4
96567,A very good course. The best what I have seen in this area. I would make only some minor changes but I didn't watch the first course so there might be some complementary information what I don't know or wanted this course to have. The first 3 weeks is nice package for learning Bootstrap.,4
96568,Good Course for bootstrap introduction,4
96574,It gives you a lot of information about Bootstrap and various tool you can use for Front-End Web Development. It gives you hand on experience with Bootstrap and how it functions. It doesn't explain to you everything which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you see it. Overall it's a great course that makes you see how Web UIs are made.,4
96575,"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a ""mental framework"" for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself. Many of the homework assignments took me under an hour -- after I spent hours watching all the videos and taking notes trying to remember it all.",4
96580,Great Review of Bootstrap and UI Frameworks. Not very difficult at all.,4
96593,"Solid course, very hands-on, accomplishes its goals.",4
96596,Good walkthru of the basics of bootstrap (and more),4
96603,Excellent teaching! Learning made easy in baby steps... very useful for beginners with little experience in web developing. Recommended!!,4
96604,"This course is very good. I took me from zero Bootstrap to a very competent level. I was even able to make a side website project that I now use at work. There are minor things that are not explained, but extra material is provided, so no problem.",4
96606,Nice overview of bootstrap and why css frameworks are used. Time well spent!,4
96625,A great course. I recommend it,4
96628,Breaks page in end.. Some of Bootstrap components were only described do this and this instead WHAT are the parts and options and WHY do we do this and that.,4
96630,"Great intro course that fully dives into Bootstrap and all it's capabilities. The site that you build in this course can actually be a decent addition to any portfolio for a new web designer too.I would have given it a 5/5, but I thought the course moved too slowly and rushed over explaining the available JavaScript and jQuery plugins that Bootstrap has to offer. The plugins are quite useful not just within Bootstrap, and they can be installed and customized for a range of web projects.Expect to dedicate at least 3-4 hours a week just completing the module lectures and exercises along with the homework assignment. This is not out of the ordinary though, Bootstrap does have a lot of components to cover. I truly believe Professor Muppala is the best person to do it as well. I appreciated his input in the discussion forums and thorough instruction.",4
96631,"4rd assignment is tooooo easy - i expect here complicated task with non-trivial work with modules but not this child's plays.Other assignments and lectures looks good, but here is too many errors in subtitles - not critical but in every video i detect at least 1-2",4
96636,It is slow. but very good.,4
96644,It is an easy course.,4
96664,Very useful course. Learned a lot about bootstrap.,4
96667,I learned a lot about Bootstrap in this course.,4
96674,I found week two to really outweigh the others in terms of difficulty in the assignment but It's probably the week I learnt the most! Great Job!!,4
96681,I Learnt a lot. Thank you,4
96692,A great course.,4
96697,"I enjoyed this quite a bit. I already knew some bootstrap, but following along in this course really cemented the ideas well and showed me new views on the material.",4
96698,NIce Examples of bootstrap and good idea about bower library package manager and node.js,4
96699,Very good course on Boostrap. It was great to have an introduction to this framework. The teachers did a good job in explaining the concepts. The videos and the materials are very good.It would be great to have a follow-up course to learn more advanced stuff.,4
96704,Very introductory course to Bootstrap!!,4
96705,Good course for greenhand.,4
96709,"A good course, content are a little bit too much in 4 weeks study. Exercises and assignment are easy.",4
96713,very comprehensive and good introduction to Bootstrap and jQuery,4
96717,I prefer anonymous classmates reviewing.,4
96723,It is easy and interesting.,4
96728,Good course.,4
96730,Very good but should be longer,4
96749,"It was simple yet useful, and the instructor is definitely a nice guy!",4
96750,Good introduction with practice.Unfortunately no certificate of accomplishment is available. This makes the Coursera platform less interesting.,4
96756,"This one is much harder and time consuming, compared to the first course of the specialization.Also, to receive maximum points for assignment, you need to think ahead and make things assignment don't ask you directly (like ""removing the script if you're not using it, you'll receive 5 pts"").Good course anyway.",4
96778,Its a good course. Covers all the basic concepts.,4
96782,Very helpful to learn how to use Bootstraps,4
96794,A great course!,4
96797,Extremely informative and fun! Perhaps update some material with the latest findings (e.g. results from the Dawn mission to Ceres as well as more details on the elusive Planet 9).Thank you nonetheless Prof. Brown for sharing your contagious enthusiasm for the science of solar system with us!,4
96833,"Good pace, good instruction",4
96845,Good chance for learners to indulge more practically than just theoretical work.,4
96860,I enjoyed the course very much but found the assignment very frustrating. Despite trying numerous ways with the data provided I did not get the same map coverage as the instructor and there was no explanation as to what I might have done differently despite a number of people asking the same question in the forums. It was still possible to get full marks without but it would have been more satisfying to get the same answer.,4
96862,Another good course in this specialisation.,4
96863,I enjoy this course a lot. It very good.,4
96866,"I guess, the this course need to be enpowered by practical case",4
96868,Thanks for offering this course as MOOC on Cursera.,4
96870,"This course is great and I found it very complementary to the Berklee Improv course. This is more advanced and it dives deeper. But it is less ""hands on"". My only remark is that people would benefit more from it if it had some practical homework beyond quizzes and if the material was made available in a nice format.",4
96917,"It seemed to be more jazz than blues, but it was entertaining and educational.",4
96935,excellent information for researcher..,4
96943,"It is very useful course for beginners and although those who have done systematic reviews/meta-analysis before in order to improve their basic understanding. There are few shortcomings with the course:1- lectures frequently refer to biostat and epidemiology classes, but no reference or links has been provided for these classes.2- The course ends without any lectures on meta-regression and sensitivity analysis, which is a bit confusing as the module 8 promises such lectures.",4
96953,good material and knowledge ... but some how boring ...,4
96959,thank you very much,4
96968,Excellent introductory material!,4
96982,It was comprehensive and worth course to take upon. I would recommend to add course about detailed methodology behind conducting meta-analysis.,4
96985,The course is great as an introductory course to Meta-Analysis. I feel like I know a lot more about Meta-Analysis now.,4
96994,"Meta-analysis 101.This course introduces some basic concepts of evidence-based medicine and meta-analysis. The peer assignments are well designed, which encourage students to read papers critically.However, practical and advanced meta-analysis skills are not introduced in lectures. Looking forward to future advanced courses!",4
96999,very useful,4
97000,"The course is a good introduction to the topic, however, it is a pity that there is no follow up to the course. At the end of the course you will not be able to perform a SLR + meta-analysis.",4
97002,It's a very good introductory course to systematic reviews.,4
97004,Good introduction to conducting systematic reviews in general and a teaser for doing meta-analysis. I enjoyed it!,4
97005,Very well organized and very informative.,4
97006,"Excellent course for students and researchers who want to start exploring systematic reviews and meta-analysis! There some few minor problem with the materials. Also, I wished there more advanced information regarding meta-analysis. Maybe you can develop an second course :)",4
97016,"Well matured course that provides a great digest over a very complex topic and is a fantastic gateway to get started on the topic. Don't expect a terribly engaging set of presentations, but it is factually very useful and worth the time for those relatively new to the subject. I found the amount of content easy to handle on the side, while working full time.",4
97039,Thank You for the course.,4
97046,This is a very good course for the beginners.,4
97047,The fact that the essays was peer reviewed made me skeptical about the credibility of this course.,4
97065,"The techniques are useful, but a course is a bit boring",4
97067,"The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice.There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with, yet this is a pivotal point in education. The course assumes that Education is a way to change behaviour (as an external factor)Yet I am more inclined to the philosophy of: Education is to lift man up from the animal state; and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world (internal factor).The theory and practice given in this course are still valuable though, regardless of this difference in viewpoint.",4
97070,"Really well put together course, easy to get into, but certainly not to underestimate... the work load of 3-4 hours per week is easily reached, as there's loads of interesting material to go through and the test's at the end are impossible to get through, if you haven't followed the program fully.",4
97075,"this course is interesting and taught me alot. However, i have finsihed the course and i hope i would be able to attain my certficate as soon as possible or immediately as i need this for my university application",4
97082,Tougher than I thought. Excellent information.,4
97085,It was a great experience.,4
97089,"Many great thought-provoking concepts of learning theory introduced here. The course is easy to follow, although the the quizzes sometimes contained questions that didn't seem connected to anything discussed in the videos - but I could have missed something, I suppose. I recommend listening at x1.25 speed because the professor has a very ponderous style of speaking.",4
97092,"Certainly for self-teachers, disciplined people who want to go the extra step. Really nice contextualizing, not too difficult in terms of time or content but certainly stimulating. Forms a nice basis for continuous improvement and self -reflection for those of use who were not trained to do so in a more formal setting.",4
97099,Great class I totally en,4
97100,Finding this course very useful and practical. One criticism is that it takes a sudden leap in the last week expecting that you have a business idea that you a ready to start executing on.,4
97101,"Interesting, gave an unique approach to innovation and creativity.",4
97104,I have been looking to get into finance for a long time now but couldnt find something as flexible as this course. The concepts taught here are very simplified and are easy to understand. Overall it has been very fruitful and i am looking forward to complete the specialization.,4
97106,"Course content has been very well designed to encompass all the major asset classes and impact of macro economic variables. While all of the topics covered deserve an individual course on itself, but this being a short-term online course, does great justice to the time and fee commitment from students.I would strongly recommend this course to others.Thanks to coursera for designing this course and the respected faculty members for their time and sharing insights into these topics with us.",4
97117,"It's is cool, but some (up to date examples) would be great.",4
97127,First time for me to study MOOC. I learned a lot but there are still concepts I have a hard time grasping.,4
97130,Michel was the best among the others when it came to making me understand and grasp the subjects being taught!!,4
97132,"General knowledge of bond and equity market and its impact by macro economic aspects.East to see that professors are not native English speakers, but was ok.Some lessons, performed by certain professors wear significantly less enjoyable, due to their performance.",4
97137,Useful introductioin,4
97143,"The course offered a good repetition of some major concepts and from time to time I also gained some new insights.For 4 weeks only, however, 70 EUR is rather expensive compared to some other courses offered by Coursera.",4
97161,Quite informative for beginners.,4
97162,"plain and simple(course content)! I found assignments were very simple , wish increasing in level of difficulty.Modules for reading should be made compulsory.I completed this course in three days.why the hell it needs 4 weeks?There should be serious look at assignments as they are the core part and key measure of understanding and passing should be in terms of questions not percent and there should be increase in number of questions.",4
97172,Very good indeed from a beginner's perspective. I would recommend it.,4
97174,Superb.. This is a perfect course to start with investment management and also a review to the graduates.,4
97177,"It's very informative course, though it suggests that a person who signed up for this possesses/ should possess some basic knowledge in finance. So it takes time to actually understand understanding financial markets. All the rest, it's quite interesting course and rather simple and real-life examples",4
97191,"This course helped me a lot to better understand the financial markets , and the different assets in which we can invest. The presentation was simple and clear in most of the modules. Maybe more examples and detailed description needed in company evaluation especially for students with moderate mathematical background. The module of Bonds needs -in my opinion - reconstruction so that we can read and understand the changes in Bonds' prices we find in the economical websites and newspapers. Anyway, the course is motivating to know more & extend our knowledge. Thanks a lot to all the professors and lecturers who prepared that course. Special thanks to Dr. Michelle and Dr. Ines for their attractive and simple approach. I recommend this course to all interested in investment management either for themselves or for professional purposes.",4
97208,"The evaluation is very confusing. In addition, when graded, it gives different ""correct"" answers overtime the test is presented.",4
97209,Good course but overpriced in comparison to other offerings on Coursera which are more comprehensive and cheaper.,4
97211,"Well explained, simple brief lectures to understand and yet to detail.Rasul Shaban",4
97212,good course,4
97228,It was a good one for basic learners but there were less explanation on several topics,4
97231,I enjoyed the course very much wish here was more interaction with staff though,4
97232,"Very clear on the points he is teaching, and good humor.",4
97233,Easy understanding the basic concept of Financial Market.,4
97241,the course could have been enhanced to be more rigorous.,4
97248,"First of all, many many thanks for creating such a course and to all Mentors taking time to teach.I wish, however that in some cases the Mentors would slow down and talk in a more comprehensible manner. Especially Guest Lecturers, as sometimes american accent is difficult enough to understand even when talking slowly let alone when going fast.Special thanks to Professor Michel Girardin and Philip Valta for your invaluable and in-depth input.RegardsYevgeny Myronov",4
97254,"Generally this is a good course. It has a good bit of definitions about markets. As an individual investor I picked up some information on Net Present Value pricing of stock. Now that the courses are not free we have to determine does the cost provide the value for me. I think of the specializations as being one semester of schooling. A general semester last 16 weeks and thus one specialization last 4 months with a capstone project, so about 20 weeks. Total cost of the specialization is roughly equivalent to one semester class at most Colleges. The advantage to the current layout of learning is that it puts the information into a structured timeline. This places time limits on the info which has a tendency to keep me moving toward the goal.",4
97262,"A little too basic, but very well explained",4
97265,It lacks exercises but other than that this course is pretty fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend it.,4
97270,Well structured course. The graphs used to highlight the key relationships of various variables is insightful.,4
97278,good for basic knowledge,4
97299,"The course is a helpful final step that incorporates all previous courses and puts them to use. However, it would be better to assign one micro lesson as homework per week, and make only those who have studied previous courses eligible to the capstone. In this case, week 4 would be less loaded. One more thing I would like to mention refers to mentors' review of the work. I would hope mentors can put in some helpful remarks at a prior stage. This is likely to give guidance to learners so that the final teaching portfolio can be better modified based on such feedback. It has been a wonderful learning journey. Thank you!",4
97308,Kind of Confusing but good anyway.,4
97320,"Definitely worth taking! Eye opener on lots of issues and topics. I took the course while in the middle of launching my venture. I will definitely put some of what I learned there in motion and certainly keep all in mind before planing my next move.The course rang lots of bells as i already got VCs buying shares in some of my companies. I would have had taken the course before, I would certainly have done things differently.Better late than never!Thanks J Mullins and LBS",4
97327,I really enjoy interview with founders . This course give me lot of insights to founded by venture with customers and involve them as soon as possible. Thanks,4
97329,"I found this course quite interesting, it made be consider I perspective I previously hadn't. The only drawback is that it is rather slow in places.",4
97332,Valuable not only for those who wanna start without VC's,4
97339,"A great, practical approach to growing a startup",4
97344,"The lecture / interview approach brings diversity and different views on the table. The topic of the MOOC is actually quite simple, and it's its simplicity that makes it so important - first thought for the large majority of entrepreneurs should be to raise money by their own means, ie building a sellable product and finance the business through customers. The fact that it isn't so nowadays, is the reason for so many failures and it's also why this course is so relevant.",4
97348,"Nice, quick course with action items",4
97349,"It's a good start for beginners, but I also found it useful for refresh my knowledge about this theme.",4
97352,"good course, complete in terms of basic knowlegde in evolution, so very good for someone not very familiar with all the details on this subject. However, I was expecting more information on the teaching part, and especially I think most of the lectures on it should have been like the one in week 4.",4
97354,It was a bit short but it was very clear and with useful information.,4
97356,"Nice course! Be prepared to a lot of reading but it was very fun, specially the written assignment and the resources for teaching evolution. One star out because the certificate has to be bought.",4
97357,"This is a nice short course, but it could be arranged more efficiently. It is a very important cause.",4
97359,Problems with the Peer-Reviewed activity. Perfect in the rest.,4
97360,"Relies on lots of external reading. The videos and write ups are very interesting, and the course gives lots of great links to further research, which is required to fully understand the large number of things mentioned in the videos.",4
97363,"Good overview of evolution. I appreciated the videos discussing how to best teach evolution in the classroom. The instructors assume you have some science knowledge, so if you do not, you may find some vocabulary and topics are not explained as well as they should be.",4
97371,"Very interesting, love it. Just a constructive criticism: it would be better if the actual content and the ""how to teach it"" could be even more connected. There are several evolution courses out there with different levels of deepness but, as far as I known, is difficult to find courses on ""ok, how to talk about this in class"". You should include things that ""how to avoid the trap of starting discussions with religious people and if you enter one of such, how to deliver the msg without going into a fight... and anti-R.Dawkings approach"". Or another nice topic could be ""how to counter-attack usual/frequent anti-evolution arguments in class"" and so on. I mean... I would like to go beyond the content and be even more ""for educators"". But please, don't get me wrong, the course was awesome.",4
97376,"This was a fun & educational course, designed for folks with not much biology or evolution background. A few of the lectures explained things poorly -- I would have been confused if I didn't have a lot of background knowledge. Overall, a good experience.",4
97380,"Basic, but good.",4
97385,"Not bad, but would be better if the course could explain more on the details.",4
97387,Fascinating and inspiring!,4
97388,"The material is very, very good!I am not very confortable with the professor as a lecturer, though. He is very distractig. At the end I opted for just reading the transcripts instead of watching the videos.It is slightly annoying that the References are not properly quoted sometimes.",4
97399,good course!!!,4
97402,Vey informative,4
97408,i guess it was great - but so technical and hard!!!,4
97423,"This is a great introduction to the fundamentals of music production, while you won't end up as a pro after completing this course, you'll have basic knowledge to work your way up!",4
97431,I Really Like this course... I got a lot of knowledges about the strategys,4
97436,"The materials provided are awesome, but the peer graded system does not work properly given that not everybody commits to giving feedback.",4
97439,It's the most effective course i have followed on line. The simple language get you involved in every single detail of the matter. Will encourage anyone to give a try to this course and the next thing you'll know is that you have increased your knowledge.,4
97442,"Great material, even though more profundization required.",4
97458,Very good course. But the videos could be condensed in larger and more elaborated movies.,4
97462,Teacher is a little harder to follow and less coherent than others in the specialisation. Still good.,4
97466,"wonderful class, giving me clear picture about 6 aspects of strategy implementation (Goals and metrics; organizational structure; culture; communication; resistance and risks; power and informal networks), also very important analysis with state / substantiate / actions.",4
97471,The contents and structure of the course was very good. I enjoyed taking all the sessions.,4
97472,Transversal view about different implementation areas,4
97481,Video quality had some issues.,4
97485,Nice and pragmatic! Some very interesting real use cases :),4
97486,"The content is outstanding. Very clear instructions and very informative, but it suffers from the ""tragedy of the forums"", if you have any question or is struggling with the content, you are by your own.",4
97493,"In my opinion, this course is so simple but yet an effective learning tool for those individuals who are a beginners in the field of terrorism and counterterrorism studies. Even though, if it is not your field of study, this course gives you a beginners look on how things actually role in this field and gives you a sense of satisfaction along with deep and clear understanding of this body of knowledge than what the mainstream media shows. This course have given me and think it will for others, an incentive to do something about these issues mentioned in the course.",4
97506,"Great, in-depth on topic.",4
97511,"Interesting course, supported by a good lecturer's team and interesting delivery method.For those who know nothing about Terrism and Counter-terrorism, it is a fast and efficient way to know more about different field of studies, and interesting to understand what are current biases surrounding the notion of Terrorism in our contemporary world.However, the course remains perhaps too generic, and would require more details, especially on crucial topics such as policies (Having examples or working on how to approach policy design may be of great value for the student to understand these challenges, but also for the Leiden University in order to capture inivative approaches.But again, generally speaking, this is an excellent course, with good pace, added value and interactivity.",4
97516,Well laid out and thought provoking content.,4
97519,Need to have more up to date data. Need more guest lecturers.,4
97535,"Fantastic course, comprehensive and easy to follow. A good introduction to the field.",4
97540,"A pretty good course. The last week about foreign fighters didn't seem to flow as well as the other weeks (possibly because it was added later due to recent world developments).The course referenced many scholarly articles and sources, sometimes including those of the professor of the course. There is no shortage of scholarly reading material.However, some of the reading material came from websites that demanded registration after viewing the document the first time. This wasn't often, but there were a few (under 5 throughout the course) quiz questions that referenced these articles.",4
97546,"This was a great course! It's like a big summary of this discipline, because it would take a lot longer to study it in depth. The videos are interesting with some graphics to help us out. There is a transcript for every week and I used it every time. The only negative point would be the style of those transcripts; the way they are presented. The paragraphs are not in line and there's no real sections in the text. It makes it harder to read. Overall, I'm really glad with this couse and I must say the online community was definitely an asset.",4
97551,Wonderful course especially for beginners. Very much informative easy to understand. Videos are very interactive and keeps one engaged. Would like to do further courses in this area.,4
97555,"Interesting course but:1) The transcripts for each week are appalling. Here is a copied and pasted example: ""Separatist groups remained active in almost 90% of decapitation cases where only a third of ideologically ideological organizations such as left wing and right wing organizations. Are damaged by it. And then, in general, in 17% of the cases. So 7% of the cases, decapitation led to the collapse of an organization."" How are those that are hearing impaired meant to understand what the course leader is communicating? It took me so long to understand the transcript that I may as well have listened instead. The subtitles option reads the same as the transcript - not much good for anyone with anything but perfect hearing.2) The estimated timings for each activity are somewhat optimistic. '10 minutes' is the recommended reading time for each week's reading content. Within this reading list are, on average, 8 articles, some of which amount to over 70 pages - if each article is roughly 25-40 pages on average, and there are around 8 articles, how will this reading activity take the student only '10 minutes' to complete?Apart from that, I did really enjoy the course!!",4
97558,"Due to the new wave of attacks in Europe, I believe the subject of this course is pretty important. Therefore, it would be great if Prof. Bakker could review some of the lessons given that are out of date.",4
97559,It's a great course to go through,4
97562,Very good courses for someone who want to understand the basics ofTerrorism and Counterterrorism. Only thing I would suggest to improve the course will be to be more up date with the latest event on terrorist attack in Europe.,4
97572,A lot of information and very well presented. May need some updating to reflect the quickly changing landscape of terrorism. Thanks for a great course!,4
97573,"Great course, very interesting material. I found that the course material did not match the quiz material, though I was not seriously bothered by it. I learnt a lot and will continue to follow the theory of terrorism and the practice of counterterrorism.",4
97579,"Excellent content and nicely delivered. Would have liked some more variation in the delivery - show us videos, problems to solve, more details for example on Munich massacre - detailed deconstruction of the act of terror. Found it difficult with the tests that involved ""check all that apply"".Recommended course.",4
97583,"Excellent course for understanding studies and policies about terrorism, its origins and the ways for understanding it.Terrorism is not about killing people; it's about fearing people too.Maybe, the course which based on the writes of Mr. Bakker and one of his books could think us a commercial or promotional purposses, but It's a great, really great, course and way for understanding actually world we're living, and an excellent way for naming many things which happen all of us.Information is another fact power will release us from fear.Thanks.",4
97585,Great course. Good introduction on a pretty complex subject. Well brought and great articles included!,4
97587,"This is an interesting and well structured course. In addition, the discussions between the students are stimulating.",4
97594,Really interesting and opened my eyes to understanding the world's perspective on some elements of terrorism,4
97597,"This is a great overview of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and identifies the many flaws due to lack of knowledge policymakers still make in dealing with this phenomena. The rigor of the course is challenging but not impossible. I like that a section on Foreign Fighters has now been added to further enhance the course. I will use this knowledge to apply to another topic I am researching - gang dynamics and gang violence, which I believe shares many similarities. My only criticism is of the final, which I found to ask several questions about some obscure facts and did not truly test for the body of knowledge in my opinion, hence the 4 not 5 stars.",4
97603,"Good fist MOOC experience. Pity the google hangout wasn't up but never mind. Would prefer more questions in the videos to check I'm listening attentively.Would also like to see a list of all the reading material in one place rather than per lectiure. Then I can go to each web page and save as epub usiing the crhome dotepub extension and copy to my ereader.Anyway you can streamline that kind of admin task would be appreciated. You ought to spruke ways to read the web pages, because reading it on a laptop or even tablet is a bit tedious. Also with the PDFs, some info on saving them as resizable PDFs would be appreciated.Course content was good and I like the coursera front end.Need someway to manage tthe growing library of reading material that accumalates not just with this one course but if you do multiple MOOCs over time,Thank!",4
97606,"Really interesting, reflexions and work with so many différents people on an attractive and complex dom",4
97607,"I would like to give 4.5 but it is not an option. Mainly because the course is good but sometimes Professor Bakker fails to hold my attention, due to lack of fire in his lecturing style. Whilst I know lectures cannot always be exciting , no matter how keen one is on the subject, I feel that some of the more tedious course material would be absorbed better if presented in a less monotone manner.",4
97609,Very Insightful and transforming,4
97612,Awesome course.Everyone must take it to understand holistic view on terrorism.,4
97614,"I have just begun this course (completed week 1) and I have to say, I am impressed with the course and how well it is put together. I am a grad student in the states and have been through many classes that were not nearly this informative, up to date and intriguing right out of the gate. Impressive!",4
97624,A very useful course which provided a whole new aspect for you to view terrorism at different angles!,4
97627,A highly informative module giving you an overview of the scientific methods used in studying terrorism and counterterrorism.,4
97640,"It was a good course, however, it seems that the recording was from the earlier course. Which I don't mind, however, some of the comment wasn't relevant, so it was a bit weird.In terms of content and how the course run, it was beyond my expectation. The list of literature provided were quite extesive and strategicaly chosen.I wish there's a whole syllabus that we can access in the beginning of the course to prepare for the assignment.",4
97647,"The course is good and offers some interesting insights into the current state of things regarding terrorism, as well as a glimpse in the mindset of the terrorists and terrorist organizations.",4
97652,"Excellent course, give us a great idea what is the studies about terrorism and show us how many we are far from a scholar research here in Brazil.",4
97665,"While making the case that theory and practice do not much up, more could be said about current practices, both effective, and non-effective.",4
97667,Very informative and engaging!,4
97669,"Very objective, theoretical and empirical point of view of terrorism. Very clear explanations and very interesting lectures added about the subject. Very recommendable",4
97672,Good course for a general understanding of Terrorism History.,4
97681,Thank you very much for awarding me with a verified certificate of accomplishment. Indeed the course was a wonderful experience.,4
97682,"Fantastic course. Though the message is clear, some statistic numbers are a lot of out date.It's been an eyeopener for me in many ways.",4
97694,Interesting course. Able to achieve more in-depth understand on Terrorism and Co,4
97703,"I found this course scholarly and informative. The presentation was clear and the arguments carefully researched and well balanced. It changed the way I think about terrorism - responding to anger with anger is counter-productive and doesn't really address the root causes. Thank you Prof. Bakkar for sharing your expertise and insights with a wide audience.Some quotes from or interviews with former 'terrorists', or from members of marginalised groups within Western societies would have given us a perspective from the other side of the debate. Student colleagues may have been able to add this sort of thing.",4
97709,"Very interesting. May need permanent updates, for instance through short addition video lectures.Course transcripts are really useful, in particular when translated!",4
97710,Informative and well presented.,4
97711,"A lot of reading is needed which, on one hand, is beneficial to the students but on the other can be exhausting as well. Anyway, I had a great time and gain a better perspective on terrorism.",4
97716,Very smart approach of such a difficult topic. Thank you!,4
97717,"Great course, just one little problem : the ""anglo-saxon"" oriented theories on wich this course is based (nothing about the french scholars and studies, although France knows a lot - and a lot more than US scholars for example - about terrorism and specially jihadist terrorism that we unfortunately know since the middle of 80's. Some names : Gilles Kepel, Olivier Roy, Mathieu Guideres). Some assumptions about history of terrorism are factually wrong too: Narodnaïa Volia was not an anarchist movement, but a nihilist (Tchernytchevsky, Netchaiev) one. Militants came from russian aristocracy and their ideology was based on the education of the peasant people of russia when anarchists thank that the revolution would come from the workers and the new proletarian class. And anarchy came first from France (Proudhon, Fourier, etc…) and moved after to Russia. Finally, the role of PFLP in the history of terrorism is much more important than PLO (new modus operandi - plane high jacking and hostages, collusion with left-wing AND right wing movements) : of course I don't talk there about political influence but about history of terrorism, movements and modus operandi.Check out the great book ""Histoire du terrorism"" - Gilles Ferragu, Paris, 2014.Anyway i enjoy very much this course. Many thanks from a parisian student !!!",4
97731,Good course with details on certain topics. It will be better if we could have the slides presented for download for future reference. The amount of time the slides are show at times is insufficient to copy down all the notes.,4
97740,A well structured course for acquiring the fundamental knowledge on business strategy.,4
97741,The final project gives a deeper insight and understanding of how to apply the strategist's toolkits in creating valuable competitive position for an organization. Great Professors,4
97793,Very much enjoyed all the videos and the lessons learned. Have already started to try an use some of the techniques and concepts I learned.,4
97799,Thought provoking!,4
97809,good course for developers who think to launch their product in creative manner,4
97811,Good course for beginners in design thinking / collective intelligence methods. Very good and enjoyable videos,4
97815,"Well structured, Easy to understand through clear concepts and processMany Illustrations with real-life examples",4
97823,"This course was incredibly interesting and opened my mind to thinking about life and problems differently! But the lectures were very conceptual and I felt myself waiting for the professor to go deeper into detail on the tools themselves and applying them to real world applications. A class that I can point to as a great example of this is the ""Agile Meets Design Thinking"" course from Darden.",4
97826,I would like to have more participation on the forums,4
97831,"Really enjoyed this course. It had a management stance, which for me as a product designer was insightful. Clearly presented.",4
97833,The course give you a good idea about what design thinking is and shows some interesting cases. In my opinion the course is sometimes too academic. It would be better if were more practical,4
97839,Nice course! Great approach to the methodology.,4
97840,"I think the professor was great. I did not like that the whole course evaluation was in just the five last days with a pair review, it should have quizes form the beginning, that help you grasp the concepts in a better way. Quizes might be related to how to act in hypothetical situations...",4
97844,Great Course,4
97848,"Final assignment is targeted at people who have the power and authority to make large decisions or try these methods on projects, which may not always be the case. Otherwise excellent materials and good video lectures. Found the information very useful, and I actively recommend this course to others.",4
97849,It was useful to apply concept on daily basis,4
97850,A very nice approach to applying design thinking in any business field. Recommended,4
97852,"The content of this course was written well, and very clear. It was a good overview of DT and the Professor is very knowledgeable.",4
97854,"A great beginner course in the world of design thinking. One note of caution is that it underplays the concept of ""wicked problems"" and newly minted students are in for a rude shock if they tried these techniques in such situations. Consider this course your first guitar lesson, and like learning to play guitar, you will need a lot more practice to be proficient...",4
97858,"The course Material its great, its very clear and complete. There should be more practical lessons that complement the theory, you may get a bit more experience with small practice exercises that ilustrate the concepts taught in the course",4
97861,Great course. I did some design thinking courses but this one was the best.,4
97866,Thank you so much. Great effort. If the videos can be shorter and focus more on the tools that would be great.,4
97867,"Topic is very interesting, however I think that there should be a strong way to share more information from the University to the participants such as readings, more videos and more forums to create a more dynamic and even more interesting environment.",4
97870,"Excellent lectures, adequate reference material. Very solid foundation course on design thinking. Only thing to make it better is to add more exercises and additional reference material.",4
97872,Very good! The course could be a bit longer to exploit more examples and tools!,4
97874,"This course is great to get to grips with the design thinking methodology and tools. Down side is that you only get feedback on your work from your peers, not from faculty.",4
97878,Short and crisp course on design thinking - a good crash course and introduction to a few design thinking innovation tools that can be applied in practice almost immediately after the course is completed. practical but it can do with some more case studies and deliberate discussion questions every week to keep the discussion board focused and engaged,4
97889,"Very nice course, it requires a bit of practical experience with the tools",4
97891,"Lots of good material.One think that I would suggest is.. a video with main steps of each of the 4 tool.. not a detailed video or steps, but a baseline to follow. maybe with an study case.",4
97894,"Design thinking is for everyone, the problem is people haven't realized. Until we have a number of people who understand and are ready to follow design thinking processes, it would be waste of a great concept. We all need to use DT in our everyday lives.",4
97899,"Very helpful, very professional staff and content.",4
97908,"Interesting course with well-organized lectures and graphics. I enjoyed the diversity of case studies, and especially hearing about countries other than the US and organizations other than large corporations with big budgets. The practice grading of the final project was well done and illuminating. It was effective in helping me understand the grading criteria better.It would be helpful if the printouts were 1 slide per page, as on the page the type is small and difficult to read. Small, weekly assignments such as posting a reflection question in the forum could be helpful. One guest presenter spoke too quickly, so I was thankful for the transcript.It would be nice if those auditing the course could also participate in the final assignment w/ peer feedback.",4
97912,Great intro to concepts and critical assessment of mainstream business methods.Some of the concepts introduced need more discussion on drawbacks or common abuse by designers.,4
97917,"Interesting approach, content & delivery. Sound examples & study material.",4
97920,I am two weeks into the course and really like it. The ideas and concepts mentioned are quite profound. And hope to apply them soon enough in both my personal and professional life.One additional thing which would really like seeing in the course is use of questions just to ascertain our mastery over concepts. Something like the other course which I am taking concurrently -- Think again: How to understand arguments. Where intermediate quizzes ensures that learners are understanding what the intention is followed by 'Share your thoughts' questions to express your views and discuss specific course material with other learners. I feel this mix of quizzes and sharing really helps in learning the course.,4
97923,I love the way the course was structured and how Professor Liedtka taught the class. She has a lot of knowledge to pass which is so invaluable to today's organizations. This class provided a great intro to design thinking and how we need creativity and a more human centered approach in today's organizations. The only thing I wish we had was supplemental material to download to help enhance the learning experience.,4
97928,"Very interesting course, but a bit short though - it just covers the surface of design thinking and some of its tools (very well done).",4
97931,A very nicely designed course. Would recommend this course for everyone!,4
97938,Great course. Learning a new way to problem solve and think in an innovative mindset is something we all need to succeed in this every competitive world.,4
97939,Its a good course for beginners and provides some good insights on how to change the thought,4
97941,Simply great!,4
97948,I found the course useful as an overview into the process of design thinking. The content was delivered in an engaging manner and the examples and case studies were memorable.,4
97953,Really enjoyed the course as a refresher and baseline for Design,4
97959,"Very inspiring course, I will definately use it in my work. Money well spent!!",4
97962,"Great course! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve. The case studies were relevant and interesting, and the guest speakers were good as well. I wish discussions had been a little more structured - it was kind of a free-for-all which led to a lot of off-topic nonsense to weed through. After the second week, I really stopped checking in because it was too time consuming and that's a little sad. But that would be my only suggestion for improvement.",4
97965,Could be better! But is good and very useful.,4
97971,"Interesting course that clearly describes design thinking. Some of the lectures are really excellent, although some did not meet my expectations. My only other problem was that at times I felt more like I was watching an advert for the course creator's book rather than learning about Design Thinking.",4
97973,Good course! The flow of the modules fit perfectly.But I wished they uploaded the lecture slides and the templates for the design thinking process.,4
97975,"There should have been more knowledge testing as the course progressed. The first week and last week model didn't help me to incorporate the progress, and I grew disillusioned just listening to the video. I even had purchased the professor's book, but found the course differing significantly from the book. Lost interest is it progressed, but completed it.",4
97980,"Nice Course, right to the point. Good use of some of design tools. Probably will be better if the course has more in depth info and more tools but is really helpful.",4
97981,A good beginning to help structure the thinking process,4
97983,"The lectures where nice, but the course was too short, the last exam was not quite good. As i have no chance to try out all these techniques at work, I had trouble to remember where I had to use something similar. Was lucky to find one",4
97984,Awsome course involving how to organize and implement innovative ideas into an organization.,4
97985,Short but very powerful course on highly effective thinking techniques targeted at business professionals,4
97990,Good Insights..,4
97993,Its best MOOC for Design Thinking!,4
97994,"It's a very good course, I think it can be structured in a better way, also it doesn't explain a lot of innovaation process, rather, it gives you an overview of the tools and best practices. If you're looking for a suplement of your design thinking knowledge this is it.",4
97995,Nice Videos. I think the class should have evaluations ( at least one moment where you could check your theoric knowledge).,4
97997,Some quizzes and more than one assignment would have been more challenging.,4
98004,This is a good class to get insights on the creative process and to add tools into your toolbox for developing ideas and how to potentially form a great idea from a challenge by providing a solution.,4
98005,This is a great overview of Design Thinking and how it applies to any business.I would highly recommend that participants read any of the books published by Professor Liedtka as it provides many interesting examples which reinforce the concepts discussed in class.,4
98015,"Great Explanation, and very useful to modify certain mindsets. I think that the book should be complementar to this course, eventually with more detail?",4
98020,Very good structured,4
98029,"Really great introduction to the principles of sustainability. A lot of reading was required, more than I expected out of an online course being taken for pleasure, but that being said I enjoyed the content and learning about this topic. Videos combined with the reading made everything very straightforward and easy to understand. My only critique was that some of the test questions were worded in a confusing way and/or didn't provide an explanation as to why one answer was correct vs another, however I understand the challenges of not simply providing the answers to questions given the course format.",4
98038,"For an introduction course, the syllabus is thorough and topics are well explained. Video lectures are well put together and engaging.",4
98041,A great course to know some sustainability basics. Learned a lot from it.,4
98043,Easy to follow and informative. :),4
98051,"I thought this course did a fine job of breaking down foundational concepts from the field sustainability in an understandable manner. The right combination of coursework, readings, and lecture for me.",4
98068,"It is a very good course,It gives you an abstract about the life around you.",4
98074,"Great, informative class but way too many quizzes.",4
98081,"A very comprehensive introduction, well structured and narrated. Video lectures were interesting and easy-to-follow. I liked the fact that TED talks and other video sources were used in the syllabus. Also, the course book is well written. My only addition to it would be to include more solution-based topics.",4
98082,I would like to thank professor Jonathan Tomkin for teaching this wonderful course. I learnt a lot from him.,4
98093,excellent course in terms of contents and information.simple and well presented.,4
98102,Good course material. I am learning lot of new things.,4
98109,"Lots of good ideas in here. More focus on planning g would make it better, though.",4
98110,Very good course,4
98118,Quick course on the foundations to be applied on a daily basis in the classroom. They provide with useful information and videos on how to develop from a beginning teacher. I found the course a bit too quick and not going too in depth with certain topics; but overall quite good.,4
98120,"In this course, you can see HOW to start a school year by setting up the rules and practicing with your students at the beginning of a school year. Students would know teachers expectation and act accordingly by the rules, otherwise they would receive punishment. Involve students in setting class rules if possible. I learned a lot from this course.",4
98122,More programming assignments would have helped understanding the topics covered in the course better.,4
98133,This course is really great but the programming assignments need to be updated.,4
98137,The explanation is detailed and clear. But the missing star is because I hoped the course would have programming assignments using popular language as python.,4
98138,Good survey of techniques,4
98140,"The videos could not be too longer than they actually are. If this change, could be done, the student or user could have more time to dig into the assignments problems and even read more textbooks related to the main topic.",4
98144,The course is interesting and you can learn a lot. The professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines. However the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context. The programming assignments are great and I would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works.,4
98156,"Great course, lots of useful information and the practical application is laid out with case studies. Too bad you have to pay to participate in the assignments...",4
98157,"The course is a very nice introduction to the whole specialization. The structure of the course is very well developed, contains quite a number of use cases that give illustrations to conflicts and possible resolutions. The professor(s) of the course invested quite some effort and time to it.",4
98160,Every easy to follow. A gentle start to recognize conflict issues both within yourself and colleagues.,4
98163,Great intro to conflict resolution.,4
98165,Interesting,4
98168,Nice course. Informative,4
98170,So helpful. I learned a lot.,4
98173,"its relatively a good course, although i expected the analogy to be more of a conflict manager.s perspective rather than being in the saddle of a party to the conflict. However it still helps in conflict resolution",4
98178,Good course,4
98182,Great course. I appreciate the work that went into it.,4
98183,"I really enjoyed the course. While i loved the case studies, i found the presentations inelegant and not on par with the quiality of the case studies at all. I hope that this can be improved in the future.",4
98184,This course provides a great introduction into conflict management. The assignments really allowed me to reflect on times when I was both successful in dealing with a conflict and when I failed.The only drawback is that the concepts are presented rather linearly.,4
98185,It is good organized and structured. Interviews are very interesting. Business cases too simple. I would recommend to make the first impression of the subject.,4
98186,highly interesting...,4
98195,Very good class,4
98200,"Helpful introduction to conflict resolution. I appreciated having the various categories and causes mapped out. It makes it easier to talk about conflict once you've internalized the terms of the categories: interpersonal/intergroup/intercultural, values/economic/power, etc. Looking forward to the next installment of this course.",4
98217,I liked this course very much. Best part of this course was assignment.,4
98231,"It's a very interesting course. demands study and it has some real life examples that may be really useful. Nevertheless, it could work on more actionable tools for the daily management.",4
98232,Excellent teacher,4
98238,"The content is very relevant to understand Marketing Analytics. The course is presented through a good enthusiasm, humour at a good pace.",4
98241,"I found this was a well-organized fundamental course, despite my slight disappointment that I wanted to gain more knowledge and concepts on some other analysis methods. If you look for analytics course that focuses more on tool or skill, this is not the one.",4
98246,"Very interesting, very interactive course. I have learnt a lot of new concepts in marketing analytics and it accentuates my willingness to continue my learning in this area. Thank you for the great content!",4
98257,"Good intro course to marketing analytics! Professor is a little goofy with his squash, but it's endearing after a bit.",4
98262,Excellent overview class! Highly recommend!,4
98271,While slightly difficult the professor did a fantastic job of adding humor to make the class more engaging. He started with the general principles of the course material to give us a basic understanding and then followed it up with with the reinforcing technical knowledge of the equations. My only complaints are the information comes at you very quickly and when complex requires rewinding several times to understand. Also I wish some of the work was actually linked to some analytic software to get a real feel for what the interaction would be like in real world situations taking the information directly from the dashboard and implementing it into a strategy.,4
98275,Material could be more detailed.,4
98278,Good Topics and learnt the unkwon,4
98279,I enjoyed the topics studied the assignments were helpful in reviewing the subject of lessons taught.,4
98282,"Was good... I would like to see more ""Analytics""",4
98299,Great One Melbourne and BNY Mellon.,4
98309,it was a great experience.,4
98312,"Good explanations of material, instructor and instructions are easy to understand. A lot of focus on state/gov't regulations that could be more condensed.",4
98314,"This course lay down a solid foundation for the virtual education specialization, on which you can build a great practice in the field.",4
98315,"A lot of concise and informative materials, a lot of additional resources for each class, a big inspiration for my work and self development!",4
98316,"I thought the introduction to the vocabulary to this form of instruction to be interesting. Although, I did struggle with some of the quizzes and had trouble distinguishing what they were requesting because I felt they needed a glossary of all the terminology. All in all a good course.",4
98317,"The course provides a good basis for understanding online instruction. The videos were informative, though I recommend reading the lecture transcripts first then watching the videos as the video slides were basic and didn't really add to the lecture's organization.",4
98321,interesting introduction,4
98322,Very well planned. Could have more interaction with teacher.,4
98330,Give clear understanding about virtual teaching.,4
98344,"The course has helped me understand the role of satellite in current communication systems, be it the television, mobile telephones or even the internet, and its possible role in the future. The lectures are basically in French with English subtitles and transcript available. However, it would have been much better if the lectures were in English.With regards to the course structure and content, a good focus on Internet through satellite was placed which is a good thing. However with regards to distribution of content, the last week had maybe too much when compared to other weeks (more than 3hrs of video, other weeks have 1hr or 2hrs). Overall, a good course for beginners who have interest in space and communication.",4
98348,Great course for first level into the subject. Hope it will be offered in English next time.,4
98349,It was straightforward and well structured to allow someone with no (technical) background to follow.,4
98353,"It is a good course to understand Satellite communication from system engineering point of view.Course content is well arranged to address Commercial aspects of Satellite communication, Application of satellite communication for different services. It also includes expert talk which gives insight in the Satellite communication for career point of view.",4
98354,"The syllabus is well framed, understanding the wide audience, the format and the duration. Wish the course was in English, it would have star rating from me. Thanks!",4
98356,It was sometimes repetitive as I knew quite a bit of the course (I'm a student in electrical engineering) but it's an excellent course for someone with no previous knowledge of telecoms and satellite,4
98360,Only if they speak in English,4
98362,I think whole course was well explained but sometimes I had a hard time to get a key point in videos.,4
98368,"Interesting, insightful, well explained, practical.",4
98384,It is good in general.The instructor is thorough and provides lots of information and useful templates. I feel sometimes there are missing links in the explanation. The work load is fair and the exercises are helpful.,4
98393,"Great course, it explains the basic Agile concepts and clarifies how to create good user stories.",4
98406,I thought the course was very informative and a great foundation for the new few courses I plan to take. I only wish there was a better summary after completing each week. Better material to study vs a very long document to review.,4
98409,"The course material is invaluably helpful for anyone looking for a new approach to innovation and provides learners with a ""method"" or path for what often appears as magic or intuition. Assignments are a little bit too easy to complete imo and could be made harder to deepen our understanding and make information stick for the long run.",4
98416,"A great course to start. IT bridges between Design Thinking and Agile. I found that very valuable, especially for Product Owners who need to understand what ""Pre-Scrum"" activities are required/helpful in their role, i.e. it doesn't make sense to define what you want before you know what you need.Some of the videos have a bit of lengths, if you're already familiar with the topic. But that might be part of the didactics for beginners.The Quizzes sometimes seem to be a bit 'awkward' - i.e. maybe they aren't very obvious for non-native speakers while they are for native speakers? It's often littel details, or rather the tone of the sentence, that seems to make it the right answer.The access to templates etc. is great although they are available in the internet anyway if you know where to look.The skits remind me the TV distance learning for English in the 70ies in Germany. I find the funny but not as usefull as they could be. But I like the idea.",4
98418,"It would be nice with more than [Ted the HVAC tech] to clear things up, he is hard to relate to if you have another kind of software you want to develop.Othervise i really like the methods and the videos, the teacher is easy to understand, he has good points and is good at explaning his material.",4
98419,Recommend this course as a good introduction. User Stories is most valuable part.,4
98437,"Good content, a lot of work loaded in the quiz of the last week, beware of this.",4
98439,"Excellent intro to using Tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, readr) to manipulate and clean data in R. Occasionally the readings and the SWIRL homework don't quite match up, but it's not a dealbreaker by any means. It was definitely worth my time overall.",4
98444,This was a quick an relevant intro to the getting data and conducting basic manipulations,4
98448,Really enjoyed the way the course was presented.,4
98452,"This is a good introduction to R but I do wonder if there could be a little more content, particularly in week 4.",4
98454,The material gets progressively tougher but I never felt totally overwhelmed. My only feedback is for the mentors to be more responsive in the forums - if we're posting it means we've already thrown everything at the question and still couldn't figure it out.,4
98461,"Excelent course to start with the basics of R language. It gives a modern introduction to R programming avoiding traditional topics like loops and conditionals keeping them for more advanced programming topics. It also covers almost all tidyverse packages with a shallow introduction to the most common packages.I have acomplaint. The dataset for the final quiz was outdated, I managed to pass the quiz guessing variable names.",4
98462,"All in all good stuff. A couple of comments:Swirl grading should be a little more flexible; sure cut is more succinct that nested ifelse's, but there's more than one way to skin the data-analytic cat in R, as I'm sure y'all are aware.Also, I recommend more emphasis on data tables. I use them exclusively due to the dramatic performance improvement over data frames. And in my brief experiments, dplyr and tidyr commands worked on them too.This first course was review for me. Nonetheless I definitely learned a few practical things that will up my data science game (which can always use upping).",4
98465,"Course is good. However, some of the packages discussed in the examples, such as ggplot etc. should be discussed in more detail.",4
98466,A very nice introduction to the R programming environment. I learned a lot and it was fun to do!,4
98467,Could have been better. Expected some interaction/videos from the mentors.,4
98477,this course is a introductory level on the R usage!,4
98478,"very well, structure, the quiz was admirably hard, but satisfying to work through and solve. you made me think outside the box, excellent",4
98482,+: I reached my goal for the course and now I understand a bit about R. I succeeded to pass within much shorter time than anticipated course duration. The course certificate is posted to my Linkedin profile.-: No human mentors on the course discussion forum - all questions answered by other students. Automatic tests in swirl are too restrictive and do not accept perfectly correct student solutions slightly different to those anticipated by the authors. Week 2 assignment is much different from the reading material. Nothing taught about charting in R.Overall comment: I think it is good value for money.,4
98507,The material is good and the professors quirky way of presenting is interesting to me at least. I'm enjoying his lectures and am able to follow his examples.,4
98517,"Interesting and very special course ,because of it qualitative nature.Though this also adds the assessment problems.I would give a 5+ ,if not the assessment part.",4
98518,"good; but not as good as the other modules in the specialisation; the instructions for the assignments are a bit too convoluted, clarity would be added not by adding more information, but by reducing the text.",4
98526,"Very enthusiastic lecturer, which made learning that much more enjoyable! The course content is fantastic. My only comment is the grading system for the assignments / how the assignments are designed - in my opinion the grading system could be improved to reflect efforts and correct submission done by students.",4
98529,Wish I could have more interactions and discussions with other students. Would help clarify notions,4
98541,"good course, well thought through.some of the lectures didn't quite get the message across clearly and some of the assignments didn't quite measure what they intended, but overall i was much impressed, thanks.",4
98545,"Clear videos's, structure is missing sometimes, but great examples",4
98550,"A very good course, although I think there are a couple of improvements that can be made. I flagged a few comments on various areas of the class.",4
98551,Very encouraging to go further on qualitative analysis.,4
98559,"it was a lot of work and there were some errors and issues, esp. trouble with peer review. the professor was dynamic and encouraging. content and most activities were very helpful.",4
98573,"Very good for an introductory course, clear explanations and exercises. looking forward for more courses in medium level",4
98575,"Great course and a very friendly professor :) However there were some mistakes here and there, which are annoying because you do not expect a professor to make such mistakes. Furthermore there could be more up to date, data. Especially data on energy use etc should not be from the year 2004 if we are in 2017. Overall though a biiiiiig thank you!",4
98577,Excellent course teaching the fundamentals of thermodynamics.,4
98581,"Excellent overview of the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. I gained insight into how power is generated across the world and became more fluent in working with concepts such as work, enthalpy, entropy, total internal energy, specific heat, and others.",4
98582,A useful course for anyone in chemical engineering. I enjoyed the material. Its well structured. Would be nice if Professor Wooldridge gave more example problems.,4
98590,Course is great and very useful for thorough understanding of Thermodynamics. But Exergy and Second law efficiency was not discussed. It should also be included,4
98598,"This is a very interesting and rewarding course. It would help if the format was broken up a bit more. Perhaps with some video of power plants, turbines, etc. I enjoyed the ""excursions"" to see the jet engine and internal combustion engine. More like that would liven the material up a bit.",4
98619,Great course by two great economists.,4
98626,THANK YOU!,4
98629,"Having completed my MBA, I wanted a course which can help revisit basics. While I am certainly able to do that, I see lot of points getting answered just by watching the video...Must have course..if you are planning to do an MBA soon or are curious about project evaluation...",4
98631,Should have discuss some of this material earlier in the course as introduction.,4
98640,Two professors gave very clear instructions in the course. It's much easy for foreign students to understand the course. It's a little bit essential againt the topic decision making because of the major of content is basic of financial management.,4
98642,Material is what I was looking for to model decision making in a business/project setting. More practice would have been useful and extra material such as e-books or articles.,4
98655,Practical approach and gotchas to consider for doing data science in real life,4
98657,Good summary on experimental design.,4
98659,More real world examples are required,4
98664,Some of the material here was repeated from other courses but overall I felt this was my favorite course in the series. I particularly appreciated the real life examples of what can go wrong with data collection and suggestions/best practices for how to handle that. It gave me a lot of ideas for how to deal with some uncertainties I was facing in some of my own research.,4
98673,A solid course with lots of practical advice.,4
98674,Short session need more handson excercise,4
98675,Dr.Caffo is really well-versed with his field but I feel like concepts should be given more concrete examples so that they seem more interesting. Respect him all the way!,4
98676,"good course, but focus more on inferential analysis than predictive analysis",4
98680,"Is good to have some data science background to enroll in this course, overall still good to learn and get the hint of how real life data scientist life is.",4
98684,Quality of this course is better than the rest of the specialization.,4
98691,Good concepts - apply to anyone new to data science.Lot of good 'read further' links and materials. Learnt a lot.,4
98693,"great approach, thanks. A few typos, but otherwise great.",4
98694,"Again a course with depth in content but the presentation of the course could improve , it seems a bit patchy and pre-reads would help.",4
98708,Pretty useful course,4
98709,Very practical views,4
98714,I really enjoyed the comparison of what is ideal vs. what actually happens when it comes to data science. This was a very practical course and gave insight into what to expect from data science and analysis.,4
98715,Very nice overview of what can go wrong in a data science project and what to pay attention to.,4
98719,Great introductory course. The content covers current topics such as the Water-Energy-Nexus.,4
98723,A very interesting course to understand what is happening in the space of Water Management and Policy at International level. A good mix of theoretical frameworks as well as practical case studies.,4
98725,Through this course I was given a lot of information on water management policies throughout history. Sometimes the practical applications were difficult to visualize in a real-world context although there were many case studies shown (maybe because being from the U.S. we have a less politically complex system). A strong emphasis was placed on international laws that are relevant today. If I end up working within the water sector in the U.S. I expect that this knowledge will help me put my work into a broader perspective and help me find innovative solutions to problems. The translation of the script from French to English needs more work. Sometimes it took me longer to understand concepts due to poor translation or spelling errors.,4
98728,"It has a very interesting topic to know about, I only wish they could fix the subtitles to a more organic English",4
98730,"This was an interesting introduction to water resource management. I found it very useful to learn about the institutional regime, when having to face a multisectoral problem and the methods to address it. I particularly enjoyed the fact that there were numerous case studies discussed such as the Nile basin or the Mekong basin. In order for you to improve the efficacy of this course i would suggest the following measures:a) a synopsis of the main laws and directives regarding the protection and management of water resource in the last course.b) Further analysis on how to deal with certain general problems such as the case when a country upstream pollutes the waters that head to the country downstream, that you mentioned in your last video. I would like to see more examples of management of such a conflictThank you",4
98732,An interesting course. Videos were in French but read the script in English to understand,4
98733,A highly empowering course in terms of Water management,4
98736,"This course introduced me to new valuable concepts, that I find useful in my daily work. I liked tha clarity of most of the teachers. The case studies served to understand better the concepts presented. However, I would have liked to learn more about the situation regarding water resource management in South America.",4
98743,Great Course,4
98745,"Great course, but can be tasking for English speakers",4
98749,"Muy buen curso. Very nice course. Loads of interesting things to learn. Maybe some compulsory readings would be nice and will help structure the content of the course. Still, very very interesting and quite mind blowing. Recommend it for sure.",4
98775,Excellent course and teaching lessons the examples are according the videos and the teacher has a lot of patience explaining everything with details.,4
98776,"i do not understand why do i need in the videos see the face of the lecturer? i rather see the whole screen of code / slides why do i need to see him talk?in every site of videos like ""pluralsight"" etc u do not see the lecturer.concerning this course.. i was a bit disappointed i thought it would give me more profound knowledge on node. but it was cool.",4
98785,one the best backend development courses on the web . covers a lot of topics . and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates (a little) when it comes to the more advanced techniques.,4
98786,Very good course. Features well explained.,4
98788,Very applicable and lot of insight into new NodeJS Territory,4
98793,Great course!! i learn a lotvery professional and simple teaching.,4
98802,Nice course for Full stack.,4
98816,"Very good explanations about each topic, some times instructor is explaining basics to get more knowledge on topic. Excellent. Thanks for opportunity.",4
98817,Quite easy to understand!,4
98823,The direction of the content is correct. First node and then his wrapper Express.,4
98826,Enough material to make this a two course. Feels more crammed than other courses but invaluable coverage.,4
98836,Good enough to be an intro.,4
98837,great course for node beginner. Let's continue to create some great course,4
98843,"The course is challenging, but the professor is really awesome.",4
98845,"This was a good introduction to the topic, although a little slowly paced for my tastes, but I am a long time professional programmer, so I have much more background to draw on than many of the students. I started with this course, which encouraged me to go back and take more from the sequence. I recommend taking them in order.",4
98857,Great course for anyone interested in web development,4
98868,Pretty Good,4
98874,"very great course with lots of new concepts also not very fast like another courses ,lots of examples there to try",4
98877,I liked it as a way to start developing a nodejs backend.I wished that it would have gone a bit deeper in some topics.,4
98879,"It's a good course that covers a good amount of rich material in a short amount of time.Wish there was some more explanation on certain plugins we are using outside of just 'this is what you do'. Course files would help quite a bit when completing assignments, especially with the amount we are modifying our local projects.",4
98887,great introductory stuff to node js,4
98892,A good introductory course spanning full-stack server side development. I liked the structured flow of lessons and excercises.A great minus though is that this course has little to none focus on testing. While in the middle of this course I lack insight into testing strategies with node js.,4
98907,good course !!!,4
98917,"Great content, I do not suggest to take the course in Spanish, there are some translation issues that can make complex the understanding.",4
98919,Great course. Very interesting and engaging.,4
98922,Slow and soft Work,4
98923,Great instructor!,4
98948,Seems tough...though interesting !!,4
98950,"Learn a lot of new knowledge from this course. knowledge points clear, assignment workload OK. This is the good place to learn Active Record and Action Pack.",4
98955,Very nice one. may be not the one for a beginner but help to gain some basics,4
98960,Useful course for beginners to Rails world.,4
98966,Quick and easy to understand lectures. I was able to pick up active record and action pack quickly!,4
98972,"Great course for understanding Active Record and managing data in a rails app. As someone new to ruby on rails, I found some details were glossed over, and some explanations were vague. However, the assignments were very well structured and filled in any gaps I had from the lectures.",4
98975,"Good overview, though sometimes hard to follow if you're a complete newbie",4
98979,"Well explained content, though at times the presentation felt a little slow. Solid coding assignments that do a good job of reenforcing the course materials. A couple small topics weren't explained clearly but overall it's been a very informative class. Thanks for the knowledge!",4
98981,"Great course. It open ed up my eyes to how simple it can be to generate a workable MVC web application without having to dive too deep into the working of the application,",4
98983,Good tips for the double AA.,4
98992,Very good course.The professor explains a lot from the framework and other concepts of web development.Very worth it!!,4
98993,"Not as strong a course as the first course in the specialization. The lectures glossed over some things, while the assignments were a little repetitive. Nevertheless, a solid class on using rails with relational databases.",4
99001,"Smooth pace and each assignment related to further one is very helpful for understanding course material.while I think partial or helper should provide 2 or 3 extra example code in extra reading material to know when to use partial, when to use helper.",4
99011,"Good course overall, wish more topics were covered but it's OK.",4
99013,"Great Course, Great assignments and pace. Loved it.",4
99035,Digging deeper into Active Record.,4
99037,Great course to get you started into ruby on rails,4
99046,"Hi, The course is a nice introduction to the wind energy.The exercises are well balanced and sometimes challenging.I would to suggest a final exam where you have to use all the knowledge learnt along the 5 weeks, and perform a pre-project of wind turbine and install it in wind farm. This way, by doing your own design the concepts are seens as a whole.",4
99050,"it was good, bery illustrative. But it need to be enhansed in some ways.",4
99052,"This course is really Interesting, i am so glad i did this course.",4
99058,"Overall, the content is good and will give you an idea of what wind energy is and what wind energy concerns. The homework was really useful and well-designed. Four-star is due to some unclear explanations of certain concepts.",4
99061,"Decent course, good overview over the subject. Sometimes the instructors could have done a better job at tying the specific topics back to the high-level perspective..",4
99067,It is very good .i have learn lot of new thing in this course .i already working with wind energy industry .it is very helpful in future .,4
99070,"great course, a lot of information, very good topics teached by excellent professional",4
99080,"good intermediate course that goes a little below the surface, and offers more than the absolute basics.",4
99085,"This course gave me a very nice overview to different aspects of the wind turbines, which is necessary for everyone who wants to work in this field. It would be better if this course continues with some more courses at higher level, focused on different subjects with more details. Probably for the future courses.",4
99086,"Very useful and practical course. The teachers introduced the basic knowledge related to wind energy in every area. Plus the materials introduced out-of-class, I have a overall view about wind energy.",4
99093,Interisting course to get a first idea about wind energy,4
99098,"Excelent Course, plenty of usefull and interesting information",4
99099,Superficial but a good introductory course,4
99100,I hope the next course focuses more on electrical part,4
99107,The course was very good and the concepts were explained well. But I felt the material could have been more in-depth on the subjects.,4
99117,very good course for Engineers,4
99124,Good introduction. Would be better to go a little bit deeper,4
99125,Very good introduction to wind energy basic concepts.,4
99127,"very interesting overview of wind energy. Not detailed, just an overview",4
99128,VEry informative and excellent course.,4
99130,"Really good course that handles all aspects involved in wind turbine energy generation projects. Really good choice for people interested in renewable, with no previous experience or knowledge in wind turbines. Designed for novice to intermediate users.",4
99133,"It is a good course for all people who want to know more aobut this resource. In opinion each chapter could be a course in order to make a especialization and, about all, one course dedicated to software (wasp... windpro...) would give 5 stars. A good introduction course, i hope it helps me to find a new job... :(",4
99136,"Excellent course. I suggest that in a few quizzes you were asking to get the numbers off the slides in the video. It is very difficult to read the numbers off the video. Can you instead add the slides in the quiz PDF file? All the information required to answer the quizzes should be in the PDF file.The course material was very good. The problem sets were very good too because of real life data. The rigor of courses was average. I can understand why you do not want to make the course more rigorous. However, it would help advanced engineering students to go through a more rigorous course.",4
99144,"Quite mathematic, but interesting and helpful.",4
99145,This course covers many topics of wind energy with not so deep materials.,4
99149,"Very good and informative, the instructors are apparently new to teach in front of a camera, they will be better in time. I look forward to an advanced course from the same team.",4
99150,"Its an excellent course for a beginner to understand the Wind energy. Emphasis on basics of engineering helps to build & connect to broader understanding during this course. Would have liked to see a bit more explanation on few other aspects of WTG like Foundation, Tower structure, Gearbox, Safety systems etc. But thoroughly enjoyed this course.",4
99156,great introductory course for the engineering and analysis that goes into extracting power from wind.,4
99166,"Enjoyed the course so much, planning to do it again later this year!",4
99169,Great introductory level course for undergraduates.More emphasis on commercial application with basic phenomenon of fluid flow and structural mechanics given in the course which could have been upgraded to 2 weeks more of special lectures.Overall a nice experience in solving problems and undertaking tricky scenarios in assignments.,4
99171,"Excellent course, but not so easy for beginners.",4
99173,A pretty good introductory course but not much more. I really hope to see it followed up by a more advanced version! Thanks for all the help!,4
99182,Very interesting course and well organised by DTU.,4
99201,"Very interesting course... but very exigeant! One evaluated subject per week, it's hard and if you don't give the necessary time to complete this work, you'll lose your time and waste money!",4
99203,"Please we need pdf printable ""booklets” of slides (no headshots “and use PALE backgrounds) under downloads below the video screen. I love MOOCs that do this for us to help integrate knowledge. Thanks so much. The course content is very good - I have taken bricks and mortar forensic classes as well as a Forensics MOOC out of China and yours is comparable. But please the downloadable slides? Thanks so muchcom/"",[g,=�o��",4
99212,"This is a very good course, I have really enjoyed taking this course, and I learned a lot. I have already put to use what I have learned in this course, into another course I am taking. The only criticism I have of this course is the grading system. The peer review grading of the papers lacks a lot to be desired. People give you arbitrary grades without giving any feed back. You can submit a graduate level paper, and be graded off by someone with a high school education. I feel this problem needs to be corrected before I take another course from Leiden University.",4
99213,"I really enjoyed learning from this course. It was diverse and exciting. The assignments were interesting, and makes the student feel as though you are truly an osteo-archaeologist who needs to 'solve the mystery' of the skeleton. The only downside of this course is the peer-reviewed assignment. The peer review is done by multiple-choice from 1 to 5 for five 'aspects' of your submission and many 'peers' do not leave any comment to provide feedback for improvement. So, if you didn't pass the assignment the first time, you might not have a clue what it is that you should improve for the second submission. Apart from the fact that you are reviewed by peers (= not specialists) who might be wrong themselves, it is very annoying that you are not able to learn from your mistakes. Perhaps this course could improve on this point by making it obligatory for peers to add a comment.",4
99219,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class! I've completed about 6 courses so far and while I've found all of them very informative this is the first one that I was sorry to see the end. Maybe Professor Waters-Rist and her team could conduct another Osteoarchaeology class introducing techniques not covered in this course. Regardless, great job and thank you so much for allowing me to learn more about this fascinating field!",4
99221,"The course has been very informative, the mystery cases we had to solve challenging.The topic and how the team approached it was great, but there have been some downsides too. The transcripts were full of mistakes as done with a voice recognition software and obviously not double checked (which is bad for non-native speakers like me), and some of the material given in the mystery cases would have needed some further explanation on how to interpret them. Especially for the ones without any previous knowledge - like me - there should be more information or a help desk. Peer review is another issue. I am still not quite sure what I have done wrong, as there was no feedback. And, sometimes I really didn't know how to give feedback myself, as I didn't know if I was right or wrong with my analysis. If relying on peer review only, there should be solutions handed in after you have submitted so that you can learn from your mistakes and are able to review the others correctly.All in all I have learned loads within these 5 weeks and I will definitely come back on another course. It has been fun and challenging!",4
99228,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and learned a lot, though there were some technology 'glitches' to overcome.I would recommend that the administrators, for future courses, ask students to upload their assignments as PDFs, as this would enable non-Microsoft/Open Office etc. users to review the assignments directly in their browser, rather than having to download the files, convert them, then dispose of them :)",4
99249,"Good. But presentation is not satisfactory.However, thanks a lot for this course :)",4
99331,"The course is really well done but unfortunately it's related to Angular v1.It is very useful to understand how Angular2 works, so i recommend it!",4
99355,Grate course for those who want to learn single page web applications.,4
99368,Nice course that enhance my skills,4
99372,Great Course.,4
99396,Very well done course,4
99399,It's such a awesome course for beginner. tutor is also teach very flexible way. you can learn more in angular if you register it. Thankx,4
99429,"Awesome course! Really helped me understand the Angularjs framework and single page web application, in general.",4
99435,I would give 5 stars if the pace was not so fast... week 5 especially have large amount of information to process compressed in short period of time.,4
99440,"This was an absolutely amazing course. The material is great and the instructor is great. I am only disappointed that the release of the Week 5 course material was so significantly delayed that it prevented me from finishing the course. I finished the first 4 weeks very rapidly, with perfect grades. Then we waited so long for Week 5 and even when it was finally released the assignment was not yet available, so my life got busy again and now I won't get my certificate :(",4
99462,where are the source code???,4
99468,"I enrolled in this course based on the description, which mentioned that we will build a fully function web app at the end. That literally means, at the end of the course. I was expecting to build the web app from the beginning of instruction all the way to the last video. Instead, the code to the web app is on github. The instructor gives very clear explanations for interpolation, directives, expressions, etc and shows what the code looks like in a javascript file. He also does a great job demonstrating how to write and test dependency injections. This course is geared towards beginners who have never see or touched AngularJs and not for those who already have the basics.",4
99492,"Superb course and out of the world instructor. Yaakov's love for cookies and 'vegetables' keeps me going.I wish the modules were released faster so that can do the course at my own pace. Eg: today is a weekend, hard to balance with hectic day of work.",4
99521,Explanations are under the hood.,4
99560,Learnt very good tricks about placement of objects. Missed some design patterns or game specific algorithms.,4
99562,"As a woman, I learned a surprising amount of stuff I never knew before",4
99563,Useful and practical course,4
99564,I enjoyed the course quite a bit. What would really be useful is more opportunity to work examples or problem sets. The quizzes and knowledge checks don't really give me a sense that I really know the material,4
99566,"This course teaches how to use spreadsheet to do some predictive modelings. Although no depth in math, but for me, some practical skills and functions are introduced.I just give 4 stars only because the overall content is still kinda simple. I though I could have learnt more with this price.",4
99571,the quiz shall have more hands on task and the depth of the contents is not enough. thanks!,4
99573,"I think its oa good course, however, the XLS examples could be better and more complete (?) did not find some functions. German English Exec translation is a bit anoying - bit worried how that will work in more complex courses...",4
99577,The course was well blended and covered depth about models which can be seen in a business work place. However there should have been practice exercises before the quizzes to understand the topics better.,4
99585,"Quick, easy, learned some nice tips even-though I am a heavy excel user.",4
99588,"good, but need excersices which students can apply all the concept",4
99604,"The content and pacing is great after week1. Wk1 was a bit elementary, introduction and all. Overall, learned some new Excel tricks so it was worth it.",4
99609,"Completing this course helped me improve both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in MS Excel, discover exciting new tools and technics for modeling. Thanks a lot!",4
99624,It was not very informative,4
99629,Great if you are looking for the basics.,4
99633,"Sometimes, when I worked the spreadsheets out, the data differed from that on the examples. The items in the course were good and built up well. Some more details would have been nice. The instructor went over some spreadsheet steps quite fast.",4
99642,"Good course. Not excellent, but useful nonetheless!",4
99643,"Some of the explanations are not clear, and the knowledge net is not clear as previous chapter. But it is still good for me overall!",4
99644,"Pros: Very good information and methods for running real life business models. The course provided the spreadsheet modules which allowed you to tinker around and learn them. I consider myself a power Excel user and I picked up some very good new modeling methods. Very concise.Cons: I did Week 2 on my lunch break. Some questions on the quizzes were a bit vague.

99657,"I like the course but currently it has some issues. First and foremost problem is tests. There are some questions that allow ambiguous interpretation, some questions require to know the information that is discussed later in course and so on. Also the lectures are quite short.

This course is my first step as a learner in Coursera and it helps me to learn the fundamental skill that I need for my thesis, which is about CRM mobile application.

99946,"I liked the course, however I'd like to give some feedback that might be useful to you:I was surprised a bit how short the course is. When I read this ""4-8 hours of videos, readings, and quizzes"" I thought that there will be 4-8 hours of videos _besides_ readings and quizzes. So this one is a bit misleading.Despite of this I liked the course. It gave me a lot of tricks and tips. However I don't understand the final 96.4% either. Maybe I missed something because after the last assignment the result has gone away in less then 1 second. As far as I know all my assignments were 100%.The design of the videos is a bit ""spartan"" :) I finished a couple of other Coursera courses (HCI, Gamification etc.) where the videos were much more delightful. This white background, black text is very disappointing.Anyway: Thanks!",4

99955,"Good. but this is just kind of manual. We must train ourselves to follow this tips. Every time we got failed that we didn't know how to train us.

100415,Really liked the supplementary materials provided in the course. Also liked hearing about research from various researchers.,4
100429,"Understanding Research Methods MOOC by University of London helped me out to get extensive knowledge on the basic fundamentals that a researcher should have and should look into. I thank the Course Instructors Dr.J.Simon Rofe and Dr.Yenn Lee, SOAS,University of London for preparing this informative MOOC.",4
100435,It is Great. Thank you!,4
100436,THANK YOU FOR THE GUIDANCE.,4
100438,"The course gave a very good introduction to what research is about, how to plan your research, and the basics of doing research. Good discussions with faculty members from different departments are shown, and they are quite rich. In my opinion, some written course materials summarizing the key points would have helped a lot to consolidate the key points. Nonetheless, I enjoyed doing the course!",4
100441,Very good for an introduction to the basic ideas of research and why it is undertaken. Enjoyed it very much!,4
100443,"Interesting course, provides a good insight for beginners. Wish there were more assignments and multi choice quizzes.",4
100448,Should be a mandatory class before you have to do a research project.,4
100451,"This was a great introductory course. I particularly appreciated the text book chapter being included as it was a really useful resource. Compared to some other Coursera courses (quantitative and qualitative research methods) there were many fewer lectures and resources. That's why I rated it a 4/5. I'm getting more out of the other two, but this was a fantastic introduction to get me thinking.",4
100453,I like the first E-tivity where we were asked to do the reading and listen to the video then come up with our own research question. I wished the rest of the course had continued along the same line where we can create a possible framework of what our research would have looked like by utilizing the ideas developed during the videos and readings.,4
100460,Great Course,4
100462,"Great course, I managed to refine my research question through its assignments, and got a better idea of how to go about creating a good literature review. Have bookmarked most of the readings for future reference.",4
100465,very helpful!,4
100484,"This course is a good introductory course on how to perform research and is well designed. Although the intended audience are students of various branches of study, the reading materials that are provided in the course concentrate more on social sciences. This is something that I as a computer science graduate feel hard to comprehend. If reading materials that are provided in the course address a general audience then it would be great",4
100490,This course was basic yet covered many important elements for research design. It helped me to better understand the parts of design. The readings were relevant and the assignments were thorough enough to solidify main ideas. The videos were interesting. I would recommend the course for beginners.,4
100495,A very fruitful effort and a nice MOOC by Univ of London allowing many many people/researchers across the globe to learn about state of art research methods which are usually not taught at MPhil or PhD levels.,4
100497,"Good course for anyone starting the journey of research. The course gives you an overview of the whole process in simple and easy way. Research work is challenging, however, this introductory course gives you some comfort when you hear the research scholars.",4
100499,"It's a really good course to learn general parameters of research. However I think the E-tivity 3 wasn't clear some people did a summary from the reading, some others answered the questions from the reading and me tried to do a connection between the videos and the reading. These misunderstandings can have impact in the evaluation from the partners",4
100508,Great set up with attainable and realistic assignments that are relevant and thought provo for a new researcher.,4
100513,Good course indeed.,4
100519,Peer review evaluation for assignment work is a great way to foster collaboration and new ways of thinking.. what one reviewer might write could be varied from the next reviewer thereby the course adding a lot of value.,4
100526,"Great introduction to research methods for anyone contemplating a research masters of Phd. I haven't studied for a while, so found the course content particularly useful. Course is taught through a combination of videos, readings and weekly assignments which are peer reviewed. Weeks 2 and 3 of the course are particularly useful.",4
100528,It's an amazing course with wonderful thought provoking activities!!,4
100531,"As a guest writer for over 2 years and writing 70+ articles, with no prior formal training, I found this to be very refreshing to understand key concepts of journalism, especially on fairness, accuracy to promote credibility.This is a good course for those who not only beginners but people who written before and want to hone their values and concepts in journalism.",4
100535,Well structured course and excellent distribution of content and variety.,4
100537,"very engaging, and has shown me that credible content and engaging content do not have to be seperte from each other.",4
100547,"The course is quite interesting, but I have not given it a 5 star because the quality of some videos is very poor.",4
100549,This course is to the point the lessons are designed so that they can be accessible and they're broken down into smaller pieces so that they're not too much . the exercises are interesting since you have to keep in mind what you want to do with journalism yourself. They help you to organize this idea you might have in your mind or think about it.,4
100550,The course is great for beginners into the filed of learning to be reporting. I am happy i signed up for it though it was a bad time at work to focus on the course but I did. I look forward to completing the remaining courses required for specialisation. Thankyou coursera and the Michigan State University for the opportunity.,4
100558,Awesome opportunity to update your journalistic skills.,4
100563,A great place to start for blossoming journalists. This will teach you basic skills that you utilize many times in a journalism career.,4
100564,Awesome course on ethics of journalism and also describes how to gain the TRP news channel or websites etc. sensationalize the news,4
100570,"I liked that it focus on new media, however I missed some text material to support the classes. Some minor mistakes on the exercises still need to be fixed. Some videos could be better produced, but the content is very good and I understand that it is also intended to be view on cellphones, so it was good.",4
100571,Great,4
100581,I am still taking this course and I am really excited to take the other courses in the specialization. The topics are covered with in- depth analysis and I am very much satisfied with course content.,4
100594,real business scenarios for growth and also pitfalls ..excellent and focused approach.,4
100598,"Really enjoyed the course guys - thanks very much for investing the time required to offer this to the masses! The videos were great - brief, succinct lessons to discuss valuable, applicable tools for optimizing growth strategy.Cheers,",4
100608,Superb Initiative ... highly brief yet informative ... thank you for your support ... cheers,4
100611,It was a very good course to learn and know things about Social Media. I am not pretty sure about Peer Grading system though.,4
100617,This four week course is useful. It nicely captures the details of social media planning in an easy-to-understand learning model.,4
100622,"Thank you, it's a good course. I only wish I could take quiz without purchase a course. I don't need a certificate but I'd like to check my knowledge. That is what quiz for.",4
100624,"Structured beginner course for those who have no background in PR/Social Media. For those currently working in the domain, you'll find yourself skipping through parts of the course as you most likely have already known the stuff. Nonetheless, it provides a framework and examples to take a leaf from!Unfortunately, I didn't purchase the course hence unable to submit the quizzes + graded assignment.",4
100630,"Enjoyable course, final assignment was a bit time-consuming but a good way to apply everything learned.",4
100632,"Very informative, I had a bit of trouble with notetaking though, sometimes info you needed was all over the place, alot of stop and rewind but still a good course",4
100636,"Very informative and good explained course. I have learnt valuable things, thanks to Mrs. Loh! The only thing i would complain about are the uncertain and a bit vague instructions for the assignment. It should be stated clearer f.ex. which theories are meant and a more explicit way of instructing the editorial calendar, f.ins. a template or something like that. Nonetheless a very valuable and good made and lucid experience!",4
100641,"For peer review: I wuold add the possibility, by the valuated candidate, to express a counterback valuation on the person who assigned him/her the vote, relative on the efficacy of the suggestion and the consistency of the judgement on his work.",4
100649,"Too easy, no direct feedback. But a good refresher, though",4
100663,This course on Business Writing is very helpful. It has helped me to gain basic knowledge on Business writing. This has also made a good impact on my work and produce better results with positive outcomes.,4
100674,"Thanks you very much for teaching this course!You taught this course well. First, you introduced the vital principals of good writing. Second, you taught scaffolding, a useful tool to organise. Third, you taught techniques for revision. Lastly, you link course to design and presentation, a natural extension of writing in business world today (how i wish to go back to the old days when there are no presentations).I found the videos slightly too brief to let the idea or technique to sink in. This can be augmented by additional reading material. Also, to allow techniques become second nature, it will be even better if there are more exercises. A option to do more exercises can be a good idea. You can consider putting this into a book!by the way, my scaffold below lol-principals-scaffold-techniques for revision-it links to graphic design and presentation-more examples and practices",4
100683,Excellent course- good writing tips for Engineers & Scientist.,4
100685,Excellent course to learn the basics of business writing.,4
100700,"Very useful to improve business skills, well structured and practical.",4
100722,I feel like the courses have been too close to the information you can get through their linked website. I think this is overall a very good introduction and was very helpful.,4
100727,"Very interesting, good balance between theory and field technical info",4
100731,Interesting and perspective course,4
100735,"Pretty good, worth doing to learn the ins and outs of this promising technology.",4
100749,"Absolutely brilliant course, excellent content. Only problem is that it is impossible to get help if you need support.",4
100764,A good introduction to the Organic Solar Cells world.,4
100770,"The course is great and the instructors very very knowledgeable. I am grateful to have been able to take this course. , but in the recorded session in quite a few places, the voice either fades away or is muted. It feels like we are missing some important stuff.",4
100772,A few more technical aspect input will make the course better....,4
100774,Really liking it though am still in week one :),4
100777,"I would give this course a five based on the content it provides, but it lacks in three key areas. First, no forums, really? This is how we learn when we have NO instructor or TA support. They also lack workable calculations. Second, there was a GLARING error in a quiz that no one caught, showing a near complete lack of understanding of energy conversion. Third, the quiz engine has had a number of errors in the calculations. specifically in formula formatting. These are advanced systems that clearly need more testing. But all in all, this is GREAT content if you want to learn about organic (polymer OPV) solar cells.",4
100778,"Very good course overall.There was a problem with the formulas in several quizzes, though. One couldn't get the app to reflect a formula properly, which resulted in the questions being qualified as wrong.Otherwise nice, interesting courseCongrats, and thanks for sharing your knowledge folks!",4
100779,Excellent course to understand the course from scratch on Organic solar cells . Generates huge interest and builds great curiosity to find solutions to some of the limitations that are there with photo voltaic cells..,4
100787,"Great introduction to the state, opportunities and challenges associated with Organic Photovoltaic systems.",4
100788,Great introduction to a very promising technology!,4
100790,I like this but there is quite a bit of data and info to cram.,4
100794,"The course gave me a good, in-depth understanding of OPVs and how further developing the technology surrounding them could help solve the energy crisis. The material was thorough and the quizzes were challenging without being frustrating and encouraged you to learn more about the topics discussed. My only problem was that I was unable to access a community forum so a few times I was stuck on an assignment and had no way to find out information to help me. Instead I just had to guess and work through it alone which wasn't horrible but I would have like to have been able to discuss it with other people taking the course. Overall a good course that has gotten me very excited about OPVs and the future of solar technology.",4
100796,"The most valuable insight was at the end.We can be so focused on efficiency of solar conversion that we forget it is not the only factor in producing a useful product. I know this but the specific example embeds the insight to better use it in other situations.Overall the course gave a good overview, though it was a mixture of the very simple (calculations) and difficult (the explanation of the polymers) that needed more pointers to appropriate further reading.Useful to know that the effect of cell shadowing in the series cells has a small effect on output. I hope the project gets funding to continue the research.",4
100798,Maybe I missed the pre-requisites - I was unable to complete some of the questions correctly because I did not see any examples of how to answer the questions calling for calculations of formulas.,4
100801,Too much formula based. Needs to be little more interesting.,4
100804,FOR THE SOLAR LOVING PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD !!! LOVIN IT !!,4
100807,This course is really great.Enjoyed learning organic solar cells. Thank you for such a wonderful course.,4
100818,The majority of the lecture videos were engaging and the structure provided you to move at your own speed.,4
100825,"Very well organized, lead and makes you apply all the skills you've acquired on all of the courses in real life example! Enjoyed while working on the Capstone!",4
100827,"It was a great learning experience. If I may, I would have like if I had additional guidance while developing my financial plan for the project. It was very unclear about how to go about setting up the financial values etc. Some extra help would have been appreciated.",4
100828,Good course. Accounting course was the best,4
100834,"Peer review at times leaves a lot to be desired, esp geography specific biases. I would request that my final capstone submission be reviewed by course staff. I got very low scores whereas I think I did a good job on it covering all required domains extensively.",4
100860,"Very much intellectual, educative and effective.",4
100866,Evaluation tests are blocked.,4
100867,"Great Course, maybe you could have the sildes for download so you can study them",4
100869,"This is a great introductory course to project management. The material is delivered very well and the material well chosen. The only negative I have is that some of the lectures are quite long, compared to other online courses I have done and I think would have benefited from some mini quizzes during the lectures to keep the student engaged and ensure that the material stuck. In the past I have worked as a project manager on software projects and I wish I had taken this course before starting the job. It would have helped a lot.",4
100873,Great course.,4
100876,Course material is very good. And overall experience was nice. Learned about basics of Project Management. Thanks a lot.,4
100879,"very good introduction, lot of concepts, lot of recommended tools... a bit more examples and practical work would give this course 5 stars, even if it takes more time to complete...",4
100882,I found the course very nice. Perhaps it would be yet better if the tests were more diverse.,4
100885,Some key pont from the test are not that clear coming from de presentation.,4
100887,Good start in the PRJ Management world,4
100895,"Good and interesting course on the basics of project management. Videos are very clear and the information is good accessable. It could be stuffed in 1 week but spread it out over 4 weeks is better to let it sink in. It may be interesting to add a quick overview of other management styles, for example, for projects with very high uncertainties and different types of business.",4
100906,"The course was quite interesting and provided lots of literature sources for further reading. The instructor was lovely and pleasant-to-listen. The content was very easy to understand and pretty diverse. However, I was not satisfied with the fact this MOOC can be finished by passing 4 simple tests in order to achieve the grade. I definetely wanted to practice the knowledge deeper in the weeks' assignments.",4
100913,A very easy course covering the basis of the Project Planning. It was a nice introduction to the subject.,4
100921,This is helpful course for those who love to do project.,4
100923,Kindly include a provision to submit assignments on project management,4
100924,"Great review of the ""skillset"" necessary to become interested and far more involved into business as a PM. Great work from the instructor!Congrats to you.",4
100927,An overall excellent course. 4-stars are attributed purely because of the limitations of when a quiz can be re-sat (twice in 7 days). This elongated the duration of the course.The material learnt within the course has been immediately applicable in my job - with success.,4
100929,Great course even for a seasoned Project Manager. It was a nice reminder of old concepts. I also got to learn more about new ones. Looking forward to more Coursera courses,4
100932,Highly recommended,4
100933,"Great Course, It gives you a complete perspective of how can anyone plan and execute a project efficiently and effectively.",4
100935,Excellent course for the beginners.,4
100938,This is a good fundamental course for the engineers like me who did not have any experience in the project management. I wish the course could include more examples to help us to understand better. Many thanks!,4
100939,"i like how the course covers metrics to track project tracking and how lecturer walks you over how to do plan projects in MS project. I feel like i can plan my projects better with the knowledge I've gained to create WBS. However, I do feel that at times the professor superficially covered subjects that i'd like her to delve more into. For example, dealing with complexities and ambiguity as a form of risk. The least she could have done is supplemented a useful article. She also doesn't talk about PERT, but implies it in her risk variance lecture (e.g., in her Tornado Chart). I also noticed that she condenses the 5 PMBOK phases into 4 by amalgamating Monitoring and Control with Execution.",4
100944,This course was very useful and I got basic knowledge of project management.,4
100945,much professional knowledge,4
100949,that is good course,4
100950,Well simplified and organized course getting you familiar with planning concepts and practices.,4
100955,Great course very helpful,4
100961,"The end went a little too fast with the description of the different tools that can be used to deal with variation. Overall, a great introduction.",4
100971,Good course to understand the basics.,4
100977,I am just at the Beginning but the course seems so well done and engaging.,4
100983,"The course is very well designed and the instructor is very clear and engaging! Moreover, a lot of useful tools and techniques are shown during sessions. Case studies could be improved, starting from the quality of videos and contents.",4
100987,"Great courses, it's just a shame we have no PPT.",4
100992,"I like the course but I have a problem:Within the task and figure that I passed but within the ""Tasks "" section no. And I passed the rest of the work and I still do not get the course certificate. What should I do?A lot of peoble have the same problem.",4
100996,This class was a good overview of the topic of project management with an entertaining and well spoken teacher. This videos and content were engaging but not over whelming.,4
101004,This is a good introductory course to Project Management.,4
101007,I found its contents to be very useful for my business.,4
101014,Great course - really interesting and a great introduction to project management. :),4
101018,My great 1st experience with Coursera. Recommended to my,4
101023,"Great course! For a know-nothing person like myself, this course has given me an opportunity to understand one of the most interesting and detailed-oriented subjects to learn. Definitely recommend!",4
101025,I rate it 4.5 stars,4
101026,"Very engaging teacher, smart subject matter, well done",4
101027,Excellent coaching by professor Yael Grushka Cockayne. Its explained in simple language that any one can easily understand. I happy with the way course moves and enjoying studying in my leisure time.Ashokkumar S,4
101030,"It is a very good and intensive course of project management. Some pieces of information have been provided little bit balled, which made me make mistakes in quizzes. However I enjoyed all the stuff. Thanks a lot!",4
101031,Exceptional course with the content being simple and effective.,4
101036,"Very well structured, content well explained and extremely relevant for someone starting Project Management.",4
101041,"This was my first online course and I like it a lot. The course was well structured, well taught and covered relevant aspects of project planning and project management. It made me think about things I or our company is not doing (I'm not a project manager but impacted by it). And it gave me some tools to improve on individual and on company level. Everything was very practical and insightful. The cases helped as well and I liked the YouTube material. If there were topics that I would like to have had more information, then on Agile Project Management, as this becomes more and more important in my industry. And then it would have been helpful to get more insights on how to estimate time and especially budgets, knowing that this course is not about financial or ressource planning and understanding that these aspects vary from company to company and from project to project. Nevertheless it might have helped (me) but the course provided everything to figure it out anyway. Overall I can recommend this course for a solid base and inspiration in project planning and project management.",4
101046,A really good course. I especially like the practical supplementary lectures on MS Project and Excel. Would be better if the assessments took on more challenging formats than just multiple choice quizzes.,4
101053,A good course on PM and the concepts were well presented,4
101055,"Thanks for this great course !!I am looking forward at having a more advanced one :-)Regards,Ludovic.",4
101059,Very interesting and easy to follow.,4
101064,"A very good insight into the basics of Project planning, easily executable strategy and MSprojects intro was eye-opener. Tried on one small project and was able to feel the difference before the course came to an end. Thankyou very much. Some more information and detailing required in project execution(week 4).",4
101065,Good course for anyone like to learn management of projects and how to start it,4
101070,Content is really well tailored and the course is well spread over the 4 weeks. The material is good and the explanation is good.Tools provided do the job.,4
101075,"The course is well planned with very good backup of Videos. All videos are very informative, to the point and easy to understand.I rate this course 4 star.Thanks",4
101080,"Interesting and important course, so useful and rich in info.Thank you,",4
101083,"Quick and concise. Both a benefit and a boon. There are some concepts that would be awesome to have additional reading resources on. But, still a great course.",4
101084,An informative and well-run course. I has never really thought about project management in such a concrete and analytical way.,4
101093,Topic was good and up-to-date,4
101096,Interesting course. Wish there is more hands-on.,4
101100,Very interesting and thoughtful stuff!,4
101101,"Great experience, esp. the peer review.",4
101104,Pretty good :),4
101114,"The Capstone project was on a very interesting topic, however it did not really allow much utilisation of knowledge from the course and was lacking in it's relevance to the application of data analytics. If this area of the project is addressed, it would deserve the five stars.",4
101125,"If data could be shared, it would make the capstones project more practical.",4
101128,I think that to reviewed by classmates is nbot the best way to get an education. Anyway - thank you,4
101131,Nice MOOC. Nice Last course. AR Track is very nice.,4
101132,"This is it! This was the last course in the Robotics Specialization. I must say this was the most interesting course in this specialization, there are 2 tracks available to choose from: a software one and a hardware one. Needless to say I chose the latter. I think pretty much anyone doing a robotics specialization should opt for this one if they have the means. It is nice to simulate different scenarios and learn different concepts through them, however, nothing beats the joy of building something by yourself and witnessing the fruits of your hard work, it is really rewarding!My main and only complaint about this course is related to the grading system for the hardware track. It relies on a system of peer reviews by 3 other students. Sometimes the results might not be fair, and you will need to resubmit your work because of that.",4
101144,"Amazing course, but contents related to expansion can be improved.",4
101145,High level but useful basics.,4
101153,"The course is good and very informative. However, the quiz at the end can be made a bit more interactive and opinionated.",4
101165,Very well articulated and to the point. Thank you!,4
101166,Short and Solid,4
101171,"The material taught in this course is great. It focuses on how to launch your idea using the lean start up, business model, etc. If you have been reading some books, you will find some of the things mentioned to be familiar. You will also learn how to build your team, and navigate through difficult conversation, such as equity division. You will learn on what to look for in hiring key management, and professional services.Unfortunately, some of the points mentioned may not be relevant to countries outside USA.",4
101177,"Starts off slow, but it soon becomes quite interesting and informative. Some parts were quite vague though so don't expect anything too in depth.",4
101180,I really enjoyed this course. There were ideas that really helped me defined my idea. I love the presentation. I would suggest breaking some of the longer modules into smaller parts. Add another Quiz on the third and 4th lesson. I do love this specialization. I am going to keep going.,4
101186,Course very well done!Would be of a greater value adding a lecture on what are the differences among legal corporations and which form is preferred by VC.,4
101189,This program plays an important role to my start up's knowledge. Thank all professors for it,4
101190,Nice course on details of different issues to be addressed while launching startup,4
101195,Very good course.,4
101211,I really enjoy this course since the learning materials mostly came from real life cases and it offer many insights regarding growth for private businesses,4
101224,"This course introduces very interesting concepts, the Professor is very entertaining and the Syllabus is very clearly structured. Thank you!",4
101229,"The teacher has a very engaging style (I am actually sad to see that there are no newer courses than these two by Ed in the UVirginia catalogue), even though his choice to base everything on cases, although providing interesting material, dilutes the takeaways in his lessons.The teachings of this course are interesting and extremely useful for everybody analysing his or her own business assessing if it meets the requirements for growth and the direction in which it should grow.",4
101230,"Great Prof. Great Course. Learned a lot with the most efficient way. Made me good to think over my business, my goals, my opportunities. Thank you a lot!",4
101236,Teacher was energetic and invested in students' learning.,4
101246,"Very good content. The pace is a very slow in my sense, but other than this good one.",4
101247,very informative and clear. Thanks!,4
101262,"I gave 4 stars only because there is always a space of improvement, as I learned from this class.Great class!",4
101265,The instructor is very energetic and the case studies teaches valuable lessons.,4
101304,Good project enjoyed playing with the Scala.ja,4
101305,"A bit sad that actual full working solution is not graded as it invovled generating files on disk, which is compuation intensive...",4
101310,Overly theoretical in my opinion.,4
101311,The material is very simple to follow. I hope to get more hands-on practice in using the concepts introduced so that I can more easily relate them to everyday life but also further internalize and understand them.,4
101318,"Good level of detail and math for application use, though not for theoretical analysis.",4
101320,"This was a very informative course. I personally would have liked the course to be a bit more intensive on the math side, but I can understand that the entire target audience may not necessarily feel the same. I think that the course could have gone in depth for other kind of models such a monte carlo, markov chains, probability trees as well. Apart from that the course was quite good.",4
101332,Great,4
101333,Great course for the Business Maths and Statistics Students.,4
101340,"Good overview. However, much of this information was even more basic than I had anticipated.",4
101344,"The information in the course seems appropriate for an introductory level class and is presented clearly and in an understandable manner; the theoretical portion of the course is solid.Having said that, the course could do with more exercises and practice tests in which you can apply and understand the formulas, how they are used, and why. The arithmetic component of the course felt glossed over and while that was not the focus of the course a few extra exercises could make things clearer and would not be a burden.Fundamental knowledge of probability/statistics will help you better understand some of the concepts in the course, so if you have the time you could try checking those subjects before, or even while, studying this course.Didactically, looking at the instructor's face for long periods of time gets tedious after a while, but this is just a minor issue.",4
101347,A very good introduction about the different models.The only negative point is that it might be sometimes too theoretical.,4
101348,Have certain degree of difficulty.,4
101352,Good intro in the topics.,4
101358,"it's really good subject , it helps me to have a plus of knowledge",4
101362,The course is overall great. Maybe a little simple for a STAT major. Thank you!,4
101368,It's simple but could be a way to refresh my memory.,4
101372,Iam learn very useful think about a quantitative modeling,4
101378,great course,4
101381,"The is an excellent course. However, in the event someone takes the quiz and passes with only 1-3 questions incorrect, that the answers be displayed so that the student can rework the questions in their own time. Please note that the answers will only populate if the quiz is passed. That way those who fail will have to go back to their notes and review, without having the correct answers provided to them.",4
101393,videos are very informativeEnglish is very simple and easy to understand,4
101394,"Thorough introductions on Fundamental concepts is provided that builds upon further advanced applications with practical examples. All in all, a very useful start to the course !",4
101396,"Great Course. However, It is a little too basic for me.I think It best fits for someone new.",4
101399,This course has a great over view of these subjects. I the course as a refresher as well as additional insight into regression topics. I liked the course and I would advise this to somebody else as well.,4
101411,Great course,4
101423,The instructor is exceptional at taking complex concepts and using examples to make them understandable. There is a lot of information so reviewing the videos within the different modules may be necessary. You will get a lot of good information and understand how to practically apply it. Very useful.,4
101427,"A very very basic course , i will suggest using it as a refresher rather than anything else .It is however very easy to pass and get a certificate .",4
101432,This is business and financial modeling. There were not enough examples of business related content. THis hindered my ability to comprehend function and modeling concepts as well as I would have liked.,4
101434,I love how the lectures are constructed. Even at the end of module 1 I feel so confident of doing well. Thank You.,4
101438,"I knew about modeling already, but this was a good refresher and it includes a minor business concepts.",4
101460,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,4
101485,interesting grasp of foundations in modeling,4
101486,"The course is informative and does its job of introducing the approach to modeling pretty nicely. It could be made more rigorous by going in-depth about probabilistic models, particularly the Monte Carlo simulations and the Markov models.I would like to thank Prof. Richard Waterman and the Coursera team for making this course available. Prof. Waterman is precise and to the point. Those who find the video lectures to be slow paced (which includes me as well ) can watch it at 1.5-2X speed.",4
101487,"Could use a lot more practices & examples. Overall, it's great!",4
101494,I am exactly looking for this course since 7-8 months recently i come across and immedietly registered .I am going through the concepts covered here. Nice and elaborative. Thank you Dr,4
101496,"Entry-level of Quantitative models development skills, good for a new comer like me.",4
101499,"The instructor is very good at explaining a wide range of notions used in business modeling, statistics and probability theory. Would have liked to get a bit more in-depth insight into certain topics but this course is called ""Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling"" and does very good what is supposed to do.The reason I am not giving it a perfect score is because I felt like the assignments were too easy and the videos were a bit too long relative to the amount of information provided.",4
101500,Good course,4
101504,Course provides a sound foundation in quantitative modeling. Instructor is clear and provides real world examples. I like that I could download the course powerpoint which allowed me to take notes while watching the videos. I feel confident about proceeding to the next course and hopefully through the entire specialization. The only reason I didn't give the course 5 stars is because I think there could be better tie-in with the e-book. I found the e-book to be marginally helpful.,4
101508,Would it be possible to explain interdependent models as well?,4
101509,"Classes had clear explanations and practical examples. I wish we had dug a little deeper in the themes, but I understand this is a fundamentals' course.",4
101512,A really good introduction to Quantitative Models. I will personally recommend it for beginners since it wraps up main concepts.,4
101518,"I found the course very interesting. My only regret is that the course was only four weeks long, as I found myself wanting to dig further into the different types of models.",4
101524,"Very practical and clear explanation of statistical and modeling concepts. Would be great to include some practice problems aside from the quizzes, but as a low-intensity, accessible introduction this course is great.",4
101535,Good Course to get started,4
101537,This course gives us very fundamental idea of quantitative modeling but advanced modeling and/or tools. It's good for entre level students.,4
101539,A good starting point for quantitative modeling. I am looking forward to taking the next courses in the series.,4
101553,"The most challenging course of the specialisation, as the concepts are fairly technical and the quizzes demand a bit more ""thinking around the corner"". Sean Pinder's videos and slides are excellent. The quality of the exam materials was not quite up to par (several issues were reported by users and fixed later on).",4
101556,Excellent series of courses. Wish I had done a specialization and had more time to do a better job.Perhaps I will do the Capstone project.,4
101559,"I really loved taking this course. It forced me to sit down and write almost every day, and I really appreciate that. I've learned so much, and I love the fact that I can learn things from fellow students.",4
101560,I'm ALREADY optimistic about my confidence and capabilities. I write down crazy ideas all of the time. This will not give me a framework for which I can have tons of fun and maybe get a show out there!,4
101570,"Very enjoyable course! However, I think that it would have been nice to have some more professional viewing of our work, since several of us were taking in this information for the first time.",4
101575,"Great course. Learned a great deal about script writing. Much of the peer feedback was very helpful and useful, but a small portion of the peers were did not seem to be very engaged or helpful.",4
101578,"The course was great in that it moves you to write. I actually completed a pilot script that I was very proud of. My only criticism of the course would be the peer review. For the most part the reviews were weak and lacking substance. I put a lot of energy into reviewing classmates works but I can't say that I got back what I put out. This may be improved with a video teaching students what kind of feedback is expected of them. Other than that, it's worth the time.",4
101582,"I found this a hugely useful course. I really liked it's minimalism and found it a great writing prompt.My only criticism was the way the feedback and critique is set up. I found it didn't encourage people to do written analysis of what they liked and didn't like. Sometimes I didn't myself because after I wrote a critique, I would loose it by pressing the submit button before the post button.",4
101583,"Excellent quality assignments. Really the best online writing course I've found. This is a teacher that knows what he's doing, and how to draw out the best of his students' unique ideas and talents.",4
101584,"Positives:-Good practice with the exciting world of script writingLearnt how to use the scriptwriting software Celtx.comSome aspects of the videos were helpful and instructive e.g. teaching us how to write a cold openAreas of improvement:-The beginner's course is entirely graded on peer reviews where one could get a range of divergent opinions on the same story, at times scathing and not constructive. Reviewers (who are purported to be beginners themselves) also at times give seemingly 'blind' grades without sharing constructive comments.The questions that you are graded on e.g. Do you feel immersed in the story? Is the story unique? are highly subjective and solely dependent on the reviewer's fleeting preferences. It would help if the questions were more nuanced and focused on the structure and technical aspects of script writing e.g. format, grammar, three part structureLessons were too short and instructional (less than 10 mins of videos for each lesson) only for certain areas; it seemed like one of the major takeaways was to keep writing which is sensible but not helpful from a beginner's point of view.Suggestions:-To maintain some objectivity in grading: Mask the general comments section when a reviewer is giving his comments as negative comments from other peers could influence more negativity and vice versa.Give some guidelines on reviewing to prevent the grading process from turning into trolling.Would appreciate more helpful lessons with deeper content!",4
101600,"This course is a great introduction to the art of script writing. You'll gain an understanding of basic script formatting, get in the habit of writing consistently and have the benefit of your script being reviewed by peers.",4
101602,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It gives you an excellent regiment and list of characteristics that would make your pilot and potential series desirable. My only real issue, which makes it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the student feedback is somewhat limited in that not all students really understand how to give notes. Often times they are very vague (""good effort, write with move consision"") not offering enough particulars to know what you should be looking to improve. But that's the inherent limitation of a course offered in this format. Not a reflection on the curriculum itself.",4
101605,"Well-paced course that encourages you to write, and sets reasonable deadlines that are so important for procrastinators. Don't agree with the statements that reading scripts and watching films won't help you as a writer, as I've found doing both extremely useful in learning to analyze and write more efficiently and effectively. Enjoyed the sessions, got some good feedback, and am continuing to work on the subsequent episodes of my new series.",4
101606,"I really enjoyed this class. I would say that it is a lot of work in a short period of time. Also there were some issues with the peer review process. For example not knowing the criteria we would be graded on before submitting the assignments, many students unable to get enough reviews to move forward especially if they had to revise their assignment. Hopefully, this will be worked out for future versions. Overall, it was an interesting process.",4
101609,"Quite good introductory course on script writing, enjoyed writing my first pilot episode of my series",4
101614,really really nice and helpfull.,4
101621,"Very interesting course about Spark, it covers a lot of key concepts!",4
101622,Good introduction to Spark. One thing that I didn't like was use of simple Ints and Strings instead of types.,4
101627,"Taking into consideration that this was the first edition of the course, I can say that it has been a nice journey. I am glad about the fact that Heather managed to expose a bit of the Spark internals and not only talk about querying data and how easily this can be made by using Spark (as most of the Spark oriented courses consist of).In addition to this, I could listen to Heather all day long - she's a great presenter and has wonderful teaching skills.However, the homework has outlined some neglected aspects of the course:- vague description or requirements- not strongly related to the presented content (the lectures outlined partitioning mechanism, but the homework 2 did not require it...)- not so meaningful feedback, except for some tests failing/passing - I would have expected something like you did ok, but your job took longer than expected; check out this and thatOverall, it's been a highly expected course and it was nice to get a broader outlook on Spark. I hope that there will be more courses (and more detailed) related to Spark ecosystem in the near future.",4
101628,"Great course, I learned a lot through the course. However, some of the lectures are quite long and could do with being broken down in to more smaller segments.",4
101630,"Gives a really solid overview of the foundations of the Spark programming model, where it came from, and how latency affects this model for a distributed cluster. Explains well the key differenced between RDDs, Datasets, and Dataframes. Thought the videos were unnecessarily long and could do with ""sharpening"" them up a bit.",4
101632,"Learned Spark APIs, internals.",4
101633,Would be better to have more and shorter exercises.,4
101638,I really liked the content regarding Dataframes and Datasets.,4
101640,"Informative. Although, it a week course on architecture of Spark (especially YARN mode), explaining Spark Jobs, Stages & Tasks would be nice addition. Thank you for sharing knowledge and a wonderful learning experience!",4
101646,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums.Still the course was good -- I would do it again!,4
101647,"Quizzes in the lecture videos would be nice. Also more, but shorter videos would be enjoyable. Programming assignments very nice!",4
101655,"Very good course, but it needs more details and examples.",4
101662,Good course ! But does need more programming assignments,4
101674,"Nice course, could use little fixes. Sometimes practice goes ahead of theory",4
101675,"Took a bit long before the course actually started, but when it did, it was a great course!",4
101680,"Dr Heather has done an outstanding job to create this unique material with a fine combination of theoretical and practical aspect of Spark. She has covered almost everything from basic to complex, but there is some area which demands more time from the creator for its explanations. Since this is first time launched course and definitely going to improve itself in upcoming days. I enjoyed this course thoroughly. It helped me, cementing my basic concept of Spark.",4
101696,I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course. What I would improve - reference material from upcoming weeks should be organized (or at least added as recommended reading) if it helps the current week assignment.,4
101701,"The structure, focus content of the videos of this course are great. The assignments are so-so. They do practice writing reasonably realistic Spark jobs in Scala, but it is hard to draw the connection between the more theoretical videos and the very practical assignments. Also, the assignments are hard to solve due to being poorly specified and there being hardly any helpful output from the auto-graders used to evaluate assignment submissions.",4
101704,Assignment Instructions need improvement in terms of clarity.,4
101718,"The video speed is way to fast, this woman is speaking really fast, first as i slowed the video down at 75% was its ok.",4
101729,Excellent in depth explanation of RDD and the API.Heather is super informative and the material is being passed in a practical and explanatory way.Hopefully there will be more courses like this one about Spark Streaming and Machine Learning.,4
101735,Really helpful for understanding requirements and mindset of a startup,4
101741,This is a an extremely helpful course. Just having an idea and how to actually step by step execute it was very well taught and having to do each assignment on your own and experiencing it was a great learning as well.,4
101751,"The course content and all assignments can be looked though in one day. Everything really useful will appear in the MOOC 2 and on, as different tools will be given.",4
101758,"Excellent, the best introduction!",4
101760,"it is a good basic course. It is not so complicated, it is interesting",4
101767,"Really just an intro, but seems like a good one. I feel prepared to dive to the next level.",4
101769,I enjoyed it really,4
101770,"The content of this course was pitched well for a beginner in social media and marketing and provided a great overview of what to expect from the rest of the specialisation. The resources were varied and interesting, and came in a variety of formats to be accessible to as many students as possible. The quizzes were well-set-up. Some of the wording of the assignment was difficult to understand (and this from a native English speaker), and the range of answers I reviewed for my peers reflected that this was not just the case for me. It was fascinating reading what others were using social media and digital marketing strategies to leverage - the variety of industries and subsectors represented in the cohort was amazing!",4
101771,"Excellent introduction, with good speakers and slides.",4
101775,"Very clear introduction describing the different layers of the Social Pyramid . Starting at the top with Social Networks with their shallow discussions of everything to the bottom layers of though leaders & virtual communities with their focused discussions of specific topics and their ""Passion"" or ""Trigger events"" main focus.",4
101776,"It was a bit repetitive in parts that was a irrelevant such as what we're gonna see next Mooc, but not repetitive in the actual content.",4
101779,Very interesting theory-oriented course. You are give the main tools to dig deeper into the science of digital markets in the future. Explanations are clear and concise. Recommended.,4
101781,"I would not take this class as a stand alone course, but am excited about what it may be setting up for the classes to follow. The instruction in this course was pretty basic and not difficult in the least.",4
101788,"It's good, is the beginning to understand social media in a simple way.I learned interesting information and sites in this world of social media, however I think the should introduce you in a more personal way, give differences between taking this as persona or as company",4
101789,"This course is good, it was a bit repetive in the beginning and the most interesting content was late in the course, I would reccomend you to buy this specialization, I think next part will be even better",4
101803,"Nice introduction to tools , social media coverage.",4
101818,it's very beneficial and contain many references,4
101820,"The course is excellent and the professor Randly Hlavac´s lessons are pretty interesting and interactive. Besides, the tools he share are the best in the market. Thanks Northwestern University for the opportunity.",4
101823,A good hand-on course to initiate you into the world of Social Digital Marketing.,4
101826,Thanks!,4
101828,"Great course. I would like more on how to use Hootsuite and Klout. Also which one is better?? I am finding them a challenge to use. I like to search for my own content as I find the suggested content boring...and often not relevant to what I am looking for. I can't understand why I cannot cut and past links. So, like I said a primer on how to use these sites would be good.",4
101832,"Very in-depth and in-deep into Digital Marketing. Great Lecturer, Great Job",4
101834,"This course was definitely introductory. I felt that most of the class just brushed over some general topics while letting us know that what he had just mentioned was going to be covered in the next MOOC. It was very helpful, however, and got me started on using the basic tools for Social Media Marketing so I'm excited to really dig in during the next courses.",4
101836,"I read lots of articles about online marketing and social media marketing before I took this course, but This course gave me new insights toward social media marketing and the changing environment of media and marketing.",4
101839,"I really liked this course and learned a lot, but can't help but wonder why there isn't more emphasis placed on two of today's most popular social media networking sites, Instagram and Snapchat. I would really like to learn how to better use both of these networks for marketing.",4
101842,"The content in this course was invaluable and I learned a lot from the instructor videos, guest lectures and assignments. It's already changed the way I am doing business.My one complaint is with the grading system - and this is on Coursera and not on the course. I can't understand first why a peer graded assignment is considered late when I submitted it on time, and it's not my fault that others hadn't reviewed it yet. Similarly on a quiz, there were points given for answers that were supposed to be skipped if you had done the assignment. Therefore, the highest grade you could get on that quiz was a 57%. While passing was a 1%, it's still averaged into my final grade as a 57%. That doesn't make any sense at all.",4
101844,I like this course very much. Valuable materials and insights.,4
101854,It's a good introduction to social IMC.,4
101856,The course gives great insight to Social and Social Media,4
101873,This MOOC bring many relevants social media issues and offers very good insights about how to handle with market demmands.,4
101885,I like this MOOC because it gave me a complete and clear picture of Social Media Marketing.,4
101893,"Pleased with the topic covered in the first MOOC, bang on what I expected. looking forward to the next MOOCs on the topic. hats on to Pr. Hlavac for his resonsiveness on",4
101895,"A little light on content, but has valuable resources for my wife's home business.",4
101899,"Very useful. I did not give it 3 stars because I heard some repetitions over the lectures (e.g., about the social pyramid).",4
101913,A very good introduction when you are a total learner in this field! For those who already have some expertise it is good to up to date!! I did enjoy it despite my lack of time :-),4
101914,Good introductory course to social media.,4
101920,"I really enjoyed this course but it really is more of an introduction to the rest of the specialisation.A lot was repeated over and over which seemed a little tedious at times but in actuality, it made sure I really understood and clearly processed the most important information.Looking forward to the next course!",4
101944,"This section is great for absolute beginners, and I would highly recommend it to anyone new to social media and social marketing. It seems necessary for it to be this straightforward to set everyone up for the more advanced material. Most of this was review for me, but I learned some interesting, fun facts about social media usage and data.The project was peer graded, which normally I enjoy, however, one of my peer assessments said my assignment was missing elements that I specifically made sure to include and address. There was no way to really dispute this, so I feel like my grade on the assignment wasn't fair. That said, I didn't have a bad grade, but I put a great deal of effort into my proposal and making sure it addressed all of the necessary points.Otherwise, very informative and enjoyable, and the class participation in social media is great.",4
101967,Very good and practical.,4
101968,"insightful , gives a good brief of the use of social",4
101974,"I love this course and the instructors. I am learning so much. The only thing i would change is to make sure papers from peers are marked in a timely manner. I have marked three papers, and have not had a single person mark mine. I hope this will not affect my ability to certify for your specialty, as i am really enjoying my time here.",4
101975,Thank you for those great insights,4
101977,"I liked a lot the course design, but I kind of felt the need of more study cases.",4
101988,"I enjoyed the course material and instruction, I'm looking forward to the next section. Thank you",4
101990,"The course offered packaged, essential social information in a way that wasn't overwhelming. I enjoyed the pace of the course as well. I would recommend this course for future students. The content was beneficial for students I will teach in the future as well.",4
101996,"It is very interesting but realy an overview. It seems that the main information is on the next moocs of the specialization. If you are looking for a standalone introduction to marketing, I would recommend searching for another course.",4
101998,"It was a little short, but packed with good and practical info!",4
102000,Great Introduction for Social,4
102005,Great class to start in on overview of social marketing.,4
102006,I learnt a lot...Kudos to NW University and Randy Helvec,4
102009,This course is engaging with actionable insights.,4
102012,"Very interesting course, with many description but not enough examples that why I give only 4 stars not 5.",4
102014,"Nice Course, though felt more like precursor to the other courses in the Specialization though.Lot of great advice and tips.",4
102015,I definitely learned some things but some of the videos focused a fair amount on what we will be doing in the future rather than providing information now.,4
102020,"Nice course, but too many unnecessary words around the necessary core of the course. And I don't want to Tweet all that Tweets.",4
102022,Really interesting,4
102025,Very interesting and great way to learn the basics of marketing of the new ear.,4
102028,Very interesting class with a lots of learning regarding the change of social media nowadays.,4
102029,"This is a great course for novices, but even as someone with a couple of years of experience managing social media, there are still gems in this course. There are some amazing statistics about the importance of social media (very helpful for anyone that needs to demonstrate how critical it is for your organization) and I also loved the class assignment and thought that it was very practical.",4
102034,Very good basic overview of social and how it impacts all businesses.,4
102040,Really enjoying this mooc so far,4
102046,Awesome course. Exams could have been a little tough to pass....,4
102050,"this is very basic and clear about social. it helps me understand about the fielf of social marketing, some concepts, such as social network, virtual community and characteristics of these are essential for making social plan.the exercise seems easy but practical, it is good first step for leaning social marketing. hope to learn next course",4
102052,"The course offers a good insight on social media. However, there are constant references to what will be done on the next MOOCS of the specialization, which gives the sensation that they're advertising themselves, and you are only listening to a mild introduction.",4
102057,A little simple but a good way to kick off the SEO course,4
102065,A really good course for having more knowledge about SEO,4
102069,"It´s a good point os start, but it is focused on theory and history of SEO, it needs more practice information.",4
102070,Good overview! Especially week 3 contains great information.,4
102075,great basic understanding (mostly theoretical stuff),4
102078,Great course for someone whose starting out and no background of SEO whatsoever.,4
102085,"The syllabus is very comprehensive, and every module is practical and applicable to real life cases.",4
102087,"The course is very good. I gave it only 4 stars because a large part was about selling me SEO , preparing me to a job interview etc. I thought that was not necessary.",4
102098,"Nice introduction, with particular focus to Google algorithms history",4
102102,"Excellent intro course ! I would've liked more focus on hands-on exercises, but it provided a great overview and foundation.",4
102103,"Good overview of the SEO. Not diving into tatics, but into strategies. Very useful tips for beginners on how to find a job.",4
102108,"Informative, but can get boring.",4
102109,Quite good for the beginners,4
102113,"This course offers good knowledge of the history and evolution of search engines, that allows you to understand nowadays solutions",4
102118,More insight about SEO tactics and SEO history. The breakdown of topic into sessions were well-defined and easy-understanble for amateur like me !,4
102124,Excellent teaching. I learned so much,4
102130,good and very useful,4
102136,"I definitely feel that this course offers a wealth of material with regards to the basics of SEO. Some of the quiz questions were a little confusing, but overall, I'm very pleased with the course and will be taking the other related courses to complete the specialization.",4
102139,"Very interesting course for everyone, who wants to try themselves in SEO and learn more about it.I put 4 of 5, because I hope, that in future there will be subtitles in other languages, except English. It would be much easier in understanding for people from no English-speaking countries.Thanks a lot for new for me information and good luck!",4
102146,Good introduction. Thanks for the Background Information.,4
102148,Its a great start point with great emphasis on introductions to whats to come!,4
102164,"The course was awesome.. Truly, I have learned about the introduction of the web and the birth of search engines, followed by their progression and development through out the modern era. Thanks to the Team.",4
102171,"If you have time, it is a good course to start to understand how SEO works. If (like me) you work and don't have time, it can be a little too much useless especially in some parts of it.",4
102176,"A good course having history, evolution, and career search in SEO.",4
102179,Good intro to the topic. I suggest reading the suggested books and blogs to fully appreciate it.,4
102180,Very well laid out course material and instructor is awesome ! Thanks for putting this course.,4
102183,A good course and helps in better understanding of SEO.Great for beginners.,4
102191,"It started slowly for someone who already put some effort into learning things about SEO.Starting from week 2, it was great and gave a good overview of the topic.",4
102192,Really To the point and easy to understand. Very good teaching faculty.,4
102195,I enjoyed this course and feel like I've learned a lot about the history of SEO. Ms. May did a great job with the presentations and her explanations were clear and concise. I found myself bookmarking and saving many of the links she shared as resources.,4
102199,I really liked the structure and the content of this course but I didn't like the assignment questions. The questions went into too much detail instead of questions about understanding the topic. All in all it's a great course for people who want to get into SEO!,4
102203,"The course focused too much on careers in SEO, and the required personality traits. SEO is part of many other career streams, so spending 1/2 of the course on SEO as a career was a complete waste of time for me. Did enjoy the historical walk-through of the GA algorithm, and the point to refocus on. Thanks",4
102205,Good overview to get started. The part on SEO as a profession is far too long. Otherwise an exccellent course.,4
102207,very nice and practical course,4
102208,Very informative on the history of Seo.,4
102213,Very good introduction to the SEO industry. It either gets you interested or not.,4

102236,It is a good one but needs to more practice and training.,4
102238,Learn another hand gesture PLEASE,4
102239,I audited this course to get relevant information for my career and it delivered. Thanks!,4
102247,Good introductory course take you through the evolution of search algorithms and what they were designed to optimize/penalize. Also introduced some good online resources. Looking forward to the next course in the,4
102251,This is one & only course for someone wants to learn the basic of SEO.,4
102255,A good course with a lot of information and valuable insight!,4
102257,"I recommend this course to the immature SEO learners. It helps to establish a fundamental understanding of how SEO has evolved over the past decade. The second half of the courses emphasises on the algorithm updates, explained in a very clear manner with the assignment being well designed.",4
102259,Great introductory course on SEO! Good foundation of the basics and feel confident about moving on to the next course!,4
102262,very nice beginner level course and gives you a lot of knowledge,4
102273,This is a wonderful Course to understand the Basics of SEO. A person who don't know anything about SEO can learn many things. (Not recommended for those who have good understanding of SEO Basics before),4
102276,"Weeks 2-4 contained good information about how Google searches for websites, and a quick outline of how Google's algorithms calculate which sites get ranked. Week 1 was out of place, and a poor introduction to the rest of the material.",4
102282,"very informative, thanks!",4
102284,"Good introduction course, but I hoped that there would be more assignments. Completed course in 3 days",4
102289,Good Course on introducing basics of SEO,4
102290,Interesting introduction with SEO's job functions and history of search engine.,4
102296,Good course,4
102297,Some of the terminologies just popped up without any explanations for what they mean,4
102307,Great course about Basic Search Engine Optimization. I learn lot of useful thing through this course. Thank you coursera.org for create such of best online education platform.,4
102308,"Good, thorough and informative description of SEO",4
102316,"I liked the course contents, especially the Google algorithm evolution and the assignment to do an SEO analysis.I felt the first week content related to the jobs in the field of SEO was a bit long and could have been shortened since many aspects were repeated in the ""consulting/agency"" and ""in-house"" roles.",4
102320,"This course was encouraging and well structured. Thanks a lot!!One less star, because the way lecture has been delivered could have been more conversational instead of one way. Like the way Udacity delivers.Plz don't mind :P",4
102328,its nice introduction to SEO. its give you an insight to SEO industry.,4
102341,"Very interesting and enjoyable. There is much to contemplate in this rich dense course. I think I'll do it again and extract even more now that I've been through it once. I find the material consistent with my own practice of mindfulness meditation, and with my studies in psychology.Thank you for a wonderful and stimulating experience. I am recommending it to family and friends so we can discuss this matter in greater depth.",4
102362,"A nice course to take on a hard subject of Mind, Moral Truth. Found it enlightening thanks all the team for bringing such a course out to the world.",4
102369,Interesting course. I would have liked to have more on meditation but otherwise it was ok.,4
102378,So much information beautifully presented!,4
102383,"This is an excellent course. It's very thought-provoking and provides insight into meditation--a subject that eludes many people. The course needs more quizzes to help students learn and remember the knowledge taught in the lectures. It also needs a better evaluation scheme--the two essay-only evaluation form does not do enough to test student knowledge. Test are needed. A better evaluation scheme would weigh testing and essays, for example, 60% testing, 40% essay.",4
102386,"Interesting perspective, and good tie in to modern psychology as promised.",4
102394,The content is great but it would be great to have a booklet or something writing in addition because the teacher style is very much conversational.,4
102405,It was a brilliant course. we get to learn so much to improve ourselves. i enjoyed it. :),4
102406,Thank u so much....,4
102412,"Wanted to know Buddhism, how is it different from Hinduism. Thank you for the course.",4
102417,I think the content is awesome. It could be a little faster and more objective.,4
102431,spiritual food!,4
102434,Insightful and well structured. A few more videos of experiments and theories besides Robert Wrights would be a good idea. Overall makes you think of the different perspectives available in this world.,4
102435,It got a little confusing towards the end; I wish Robert took a little more time on those topics.,4
102445,I liked it very much. An accomplishment diploma would have been ok.Thank You!!,4
102448,Fantastic sauce of information and nice subtle humor.Really interesting material but kind of a depressingly sounding lecturer. Looking forward for more courses from this lecturer and more of blooming of joy in his voice in future lectures.,4
102449,Enjoy the course,4
102456,"This course was great as an introduction to Buddhism and the basics of psychology behind it. It can definately be refined, but I deeply enjoyed it. I can say it changed the way I use my mind.",4
102467,"For those interested in what Buddhism has to offer regarding the mind, but without any of the religious aspects, this is a good course both for information as well as for being thought-provoking/stimulating. The online environment enables contact with people and materials which might otherwise be beyond reach.",4
102468,Interesting introduction to Buddhism and psychology. Dr. Wright does a good job providing examples of how modern science supports Buddhist thoughts and ideas. He also invites a wide range of fascinating speakers from Buddhist monks to psychologists to weigh in on the subject. The quiz questions and essay assignments were a bit too easy.,4
102480,"Interesting, and more grounded than I was expecting from a class focused on meditation. Well done.",4
102491,"interesting, but monotonous lectures.",4
102492,"Thank you for Sharing This Knowledge to everyone, I am really enjoying this course and have learned a lot already from this Material, I am really looking forward to keep learning more!",4
102495,"An interesting supplement to my Zen studies and practice. While somewhat speculative in some parts (largely due to fact that the brain's complexity makes full understanding just a little out of reach even today), the course is clearly built upon the foundations of rigorous science, thousands of years of Buddhist inquiry and common sense.",4
102506,thank you,4
102512,"The course is extremely rich and sophisticated. I had taken it sometime back but after attending the 10 day Vipassana, I came back to take it again and it made much better sense. Prof. Wright is superlative in knowledge, neutrality of view, and of course humour. However one thing I'd recommend is that it becomes quite a challenge to follow the course after a while given (of course) the subject in hand as well as, importantly, the delivery style. I wish it had visual/ pictoral supplements or some other ideas implemented to make it penetrate better!",4
102520,"Very enlightening, I would recommend this course.",4
102523,"Good work, crossing science and buddhism.",4
102531,"Easy to follow , real life examples",4
102536,Very inspiring to understand my own religion，thanks a lot to the scientific contribution in this particular area。,4
102540,"Very nice course, very interesting. I really liked the professor's specific sence of humour in examples he makes. The course was a little boring because of a lot talking about things already talked and understood, lots of specifications for people who might argue or disagree, or might feel offended.",4
102553,"This course is a wonderful nexus between east and west, between science and religion, between intuition and reason and between all those dichotomies, the false ones and more! It is just a shame that discussion forum moderators have become petty tyrants given censorship powers. At least, that was how it was last time I was bothered enough to try to get this stuff. One star subtracted, but it should be more given discussion is the only way really to do philosophy. Only one will do though because I guess it is a systemic problem and that it probably doesn't affect those of you who aren't borderline trolls who imbeciles easily mistake for the bad kind.",4
102560,Well articulated and structured.,4
102569,I loved the informations they're giving us and how the professor,4
102572,Very interesting topics are discussed in this course. I walked away with some new thoughts and ideas about modern science and how they compared to ancient teachings. Well worth the time.,4
102588,"The course goes a long way in proving what it sets out to prove. However, it would have been good to hear from some people (I am sure they exist) who dispute the stipulated thesis that modern psychology confirms that accuracy of the Buddhist analysis of the human mind.",4
102595,I would re,4
102605,The ideas are a little stretched but nevertheless a fun and enlightening course.,4
102651,"It was pretty good for most of the time. I found the professor engaging and interesting. He was an effortless speaker who never seemed bored--you could tell he was passionate, but did not alienate students by using too much jargon or academe-speak. I sort of fell off of the course toward the end mostly because I felt much of the material began to repeat (or at least became extremely predictable). Overall, really great course.",4
102661,I love opening my mind up to new concepts and ways of thinking. It's challenging and keeps me on my toes.,4
102670,"Concise and full of interesting ideas - a great introduction to many topics that are worth exploring, and think through.",4
102713,"The second half of lectures were a little confusing, but nothing that a rewatch can´t solve!",4
102733,Easy to follow format and easy to work in to a busy schedule.,4
102742,"Very interesting course. Good depth into the subject matter, a bit more enthusiasm from the professor could go a long way into making the course a bit more vibrant.",4
102754,"An awesome course on psychology, for both newbies and students, but also an excellent introduction to Buddhism. I'm just perplex about the view of evolution as an entity that (seems to) shapes biological and psychological features with the purpose of obtaining advantages.",4
102758,Excellent narration by the Professor. A little trivialisation here and there is presumably for native audiences though it may seem irreverent to Indians like me. Linkage to Evolutionary Psychology is illuminating.,4
102760,I learned a lot and loved the dogggies and the professor's sense of humor!,4
102773,Buddhist lite but very interesting to consider evolutionary psychology. Excellent contributors to the course content.,4
102780,"Lectures were interesting, fun, and...dare I say...enlightening? Though I was initially put off by having to write papers, I did see the value in it as I had to review the written transcripts of the video lectures and work to assemble my ideas and arguments for the essays. I would definitely take another class by Prof. Wright, Milo and Frasier.",4
102786,The course was very interesting.Thanks!,4
102796,"A very rebellious upstream swim against natural selection and the Buddhist Neo's heroic effort to Nibbana! Drawing parallels to evolutionary and social psychology, Robert Wright takes you in an inward journey that brings to clear focus the origin of suffering and the prescriptive teachings of Gautama the Buddha to overcome suffering by embracing your true self. If you are looking for personal mastery, this is for you. If you have intense cravings, this is for you. If you are afflicted with compulsive behaviors, this is for you. If you are thinking ""what the heck is all this"", trust me, this course is for you.",4
102798,I don't like the idea of writing 800 words essays in English though.,4
102808,"The lectures are great, and the material covered is awesome. I do not own a copy of the accompanied textbook, but I imagine that this course would be even better if I did.Sometimes the homework sessions felt a little contrived - but I am fairly certain that this was just an artifact of making them peer-gradable.",4
102822,"I like this course very much, I dropped out once because some of the homework questions are not quite obvious for me. After refer to other material, I survived the course. Frankly speaking, I am still not familiar with most of the contents. But this course displayed a vivid picture of MCMC. I will keep learning the subject in the future.The discussion session is too quiet, maybe I should have asked more questions.",4
102834,Great course!!! I've learned a lot. I don't give 5 stars only because sometimes professors were not so clear speaking.,4
102837,This is so useful for network communications and mobile communications as well,4
102838,"The transcripts are not actually same, so its difficult sometimes to get what speaker is saying as accent is hard to understand.Content is good but its not depth for engineering students",4
102843,I very much enjoyed the course assignments.,4
102844,"It is very interesting and a very wide approach of violence, from theoretical grounds to practical applications. I would have prefered a little bit more information focused on the latter, especially regading intervention and prevention. Otherwise, great.",4
102848,Good general overview. Only wish it was longer and could cover material in more detail.,4
102852,"This course provides a very broad understanding of violence prevalent in the United States and globally. Statistics and critical self-reflection points are provided throughout the course. If you're looking for a course to challenge your views of violence or, simply, to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter, this course is for you.",4
102853,Excellent course. It makes you analyze yourself own thoughts and ideas about violence.,4
102860,Excellent Starter course for Core data and networking.,4
102867,"The course needs to be updated to reflect API and third-party service changes, but the JSON material and (especially) the core storage lesson are well worth the effort.",4
102868,"Good course, but not that much network and not so much security. Nevertheless, good course with useful techniques and explanations.",4
102871,Thi course covers up the basics of networking and security for iOS applications using Objective-C. It's a great course if you want to understand the basics and want to implement in practice some of these topics. I just wish it cover more cases and more apps. But for that this should be a course more longer than it is. Nevertheless it's a great course.,4
102877,"Great material, a bit confusing to follow on certain assignments where there's live code writing, troubleshooting and turning off/on of the recording.",4
102879,"I expected more information about security,",4
102881,Great course with a lot of examples on integration with social networks and secure transportation layer.,4
102891,Great,4
102893,Good course; very interesting. I would like to see the professor grade the course papers or at least review them instead of stric,4
102896,"Great course. Really good for those who want to be managers/leader, and those who are already leaders. Lots of reading required, but it is OK.",4
102899,Well organized and good lessons/presentations!I suggest to insert more exercises/assignment to increase the student's skills!,4
102906,"good course, poor slides in pdf",4
102917,"I was studied about academic writing but did not finish, still reading on recommend references. Academic writing tells about communicative what is the objective of the essay who is your audience. Academic writing looks about the flow and writibg style. It avoid writing in short form like can't and ensures vocabulary.",4
102919,"Has plenty of material, the activities are most of the time very useful. I spent a lot of time reading the AWELU material and other web references, that were extremely valuables for me; however, the videos sometimes are not very productive and slow paced and some activities came very often and were not needed.",4
102927,"Good introduction, but too few concrete examples.",4
102930,Enjoyed the Foundation of Web Development. For the next iteration of the course I would suggestion going over in more detail how HTML and JavaScript should be linked with using JavaScript validation. This was something many learners struggled with and the provided resources missed some key things beginners would struggle to grasp.,4
102931,"Good course, comprehensively covering key concepts involved in Web development. Although It does not touch server side development, but provides foundation to pursue advanced courses in web development and design. Thanks Coursera.",4
102933,"I did learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and plan on learning more on my own. I enjoyed the course overall but felt like it should have been longer and more introductory for those of us who knew nothing about programing concepts.",4
102935,Over all the course was very informative and easy to understand for a beginner.,4
102943,The evaluation forms of the last two milestone projects are quite burdensome for students to grade by item.,4
102983,"Helpful introductory, but should place more emphasis on the ools you could use to perform SEO Tasks.",4
102985,Great course I do wish the tools were introduced or at least downloaded in this section instead of fundamentals.,4
102989,"This course is sooooo much better than the intro course, which I am happy to say i was refunded for. This one dispenses useful and practical information right from the start. My only issue now is that I'd like to get the full specialization, but I'm not paying for that first useless course (sorry if that sounds harsh, just being honest). I highly recommend you make the first course optional or free to people who take the remaining courses and want to receive the specialization.I'm rating 4 stars because I haven't finished the course yet so want to see how my learning will be tested in the end before forming a final opinion. So far it's just been a few questions, but I like the way they pop up at unexpected times during the presentation. Keeps me alert :)",4
102993,This course is very good. It would have been nice to have the slides hence four stars.,4
102999,The course materials are very good for anyone who wants to get into SEO. I only gave 4 stars because I personally dislike the quizzes. They don't focus on what's important but rather on small detail questions that don't really matter.Other than that it's a great course! Most of it you can find in books too but with videos & the community it's more fun to learn on Coursera.,4
103035,"Excellent content, but I would prefer the assignments be evaluated and rated by experts, not the colleagues.",4
103053,"I found this very useful for the beginning with SEO. There are lots of the areas to deepen, but for general understanding it was really convenient.",4
103066,"One piece of improvement is to stream line the peer graded assignment. I noticed a slight disconnect between the writing prompt and the grading rubric particularly around the implementation of metrics to track success of content improvement initiatives. What would be wrong to use the grading rubric as a baseline for the writing prompt that can be used as a guideline for student to follow when drafting his response. This would save a lot of back and forth between submitting a blank sheet of work in order to see how the grading is set up, then going back to adjust the original work to make it fit the grading sheet.",4
103090,Great content and ideas. Thank you.,4
103091,"It was a pretty good course with great take away. Some of this take away might seem obvious for some people, but it's good to absorb them from an expert in the area!Some of the videos still need edition as they invite you to watch a video which is not embedded in the video, then the teacher starts talking about the video.....To enhance the course, I would recommend to correct the above and perhaps inviting other experts for some interviews to show to the audience.",4
103096,"This course really helped me to come up with a great weight loss plan. I know the hard part is still in front of me, but I feel more confident now than I ever have embarking on a weight loss journey.",4
103098,Good concept and such a true message. Hard to realize and for sure finally the only way to get slim and stay slim,4
103099,"The content was great and I found it very helpful, especially the actual scientific studies that backed the information. I was greatly annoyed at the requirement of having to purchase the course in order to do the homework and peer projects. I have never had to do that before and I have taken quite a few Coursera classes.",4
103103,"I don't know if something as personal as weight loss should be a peer reviewed class. I didn't pay for the class so I wasn't involved in the peer review process. But in other classes I have taken and participated in the peer review process has shown that there are some who make it their goal to be as critical as possible, whether for the right or wrong reasons.",4
103107,"Thorough, gives you good tools to make a plan.",4
103115,Great Course to know more about soil management as well as sustainable farming. there are tonnes of great examples and best practices that can change way of soil management as well as farming.,4
103125,"The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions. The topics are covered by providing plenty of background explanation, though I found the repetition way too much at times. I would have liked to see the English in the slides, transcription of the videos, and most importantly, in the quizzes, proofread - at times, the seemingly small errors made it hard to understand what the quiz questions were about. A good introductory course all around. Thanks for your efforts!",4
103128,amazing it was my first experience but it was amazing,4
103132,Great introduction about the topic.,4
103149,seems like an excellent review on the functioning of the brain at the axon/dendrite level.,4
103159,"The course was fantastic!I just like to see more details for each of human senses.For example for the vision, speaking, hearing, listening, emotions.I know some problem are kinda solved and people got Nobel prize for that. It could be more interesting if you could tell us which problems are not solved yet and if become solved there would be a Nobel for that.In general, I love the course and the teacher! Thanks",4
103160,Excellent course content and teaching style. I would like to thank Prof. Segev and Prof. Nelken for introducing me to this exciting domain.,4
103166,"I just watched the videos and didn't do any of the assignments. I had to skip the guest lecturer because I couldn't understand him, so that's the only reason I took off one star. If you are ok with reading what you can't listen to, then it would be 5 stars for the lectures.",4
103176,"Broad overview, many historical aspects and some time dedicated to new discoveries. As a total novice in the field I found it really interesting. Sometimes the assignments aren't focused on understanding but at memorizing (useless?) details.",4
103189,a very clear an simple lecturer,4
103191,"Intense, interesting, very passionate professor. I have to admit I felt at times quite challenged, but overall a very satisfying course",4
103193,"Lections are good except it was quite hard to listen the guest lecturer. The material was interesting, but the form and the way he said the information was difficult for me.Quizzes are not very informative, and sometimes seem to be too tricky without any value to this trickiness.Big thanks to Idan for this course.",4
103197,a bit labored at times which makes most lesson longer than might otherwise be.Patient teacher who is keen on his subject and tries very hard to teach in great details,4
103212,too more recapitulations/ but very good lextures,4
103215,very simple teaching with condensed materials.thank you for all helping us to watch and participate in this course.only one point that should be taken in consideration. why i cannot obtain statement of accomplishment even i pass all exams. why there is only statement with verification,4
103219,i am not a guy who goes well with mathematic equations besides that this course is really valuable. God bless,4
103220,"I found this course to be extremely engaging and taught in greater depth than I have initially presumed. My first plan was to finish this course in ten days, but I realized that it would be a waste to rush and try to finish it as planned instead of grasping better the information so beautifully presented.Mr. Idan Segev is a great teacher, one that I wished to have had in my biology class. Although the mathematical and physics aspect of the course were a challenge for me, after some individual study and great help from the discussion thread I can say that I got a good grasp of what this course had to teach.As a 11th grade student, this course opened my eyes in regard to the latest technologies, international projects, and ideas pursued by world-wide scientists. I plan to apply for a degree in Neuroscience, and what I have learned here only strengthen my desire to do so, which I can not thank enough for.In the future, I am looking forward to new courses about the beauty of the brain and I genuinely hope that Mr. Idan Segev will decide to make other courses such as this one.",4
103222,Quite organized and easy-understood! It's really helpful~,4
103226,I like this course.It teached me something I like,4
103237,"The teacher is humorous, and teach me something useful to my life.",4
103246,Very informative. I have learnt a lot,4
103247,This was an informative class and I learned things that I am using to help shape my professional outlook.,4
103266,"I learned a lot of useful information, thanks",4
103267,The teacher talk much about his own experiences.,4
103269,"It's a good lecture! I learned a lot skills from it. If it could be a litter bit shorter, I will feel more comfor",4
103276,pretty good,4
103279,This course contained excellent invitations to open up tinkering-type thinking and hands on work. I appreciated the connections between tinkering and art. Working through the course activities increased my confidence and understanding.,4
103289,"It is a great course for introduction about identifying social entrepreneurship opportunities. They show you some organizations, what they do, how they were created and so on through interviews. They also provide links and interseting documents where you can get additional information. It is also good because you can interact with other students, their projects and ideas. I miss a few things like giving you tools and social business plans but I believe that they will come in the next courses.",4
103290,I believe we could have had more analysis information,4
103296,The course was ok. Some of the answers in the practise quiz were wrong.,4
103303,Good introduction if there is no knowledge about Human centered Design. I think it could have more practice about the topics we saw.The explanations of the professor were very clear and understandable.,4
103311,"We were presented a totally new approach to innovation and entrepreneurship, which was very interesting and inspiring. Prof. Shlomo Maital provides us with an impuls to go through an experience and transformation stages (as per Gilmore and Pine II).Mr. Professor ! Thanks for spending time with us and sharing your knowledge and wisdom.",4
103321,the course is an eye opener and highly inspiring.,4
103324,Professor Shlomo Maital is brilliant!,4
103333,"Although some aspects were repetitive, I do enjoy learning from the many stories of creative problem solving.",4
103339,"as i've gone through the first week of the archived version of this course , i felt that Prof. (Emeritus) Shlomo Maital is doing his best to make the course unique , when they lunched the paid version i immediately applied in it because it suits me and because i have confidence in the content",4
103341,The course is over loaded with extremely long videos. Otherwise it is an excellent course.,4
103345,The course is very interesting but sometimes is too fast on difficult steps,4
103349,A general brief about how you can make calculated and broad assumptions on the tock market. Not a specialized course but is helpful in getting the basics.,4
103360,The course was pretty good. Also the examples used while explaining various concepts were very helpful while trying to understand.,4
103361,"A little bit shallow, but beginners-friendly",4
103367,"The course is related with language and logical analysis , so it's a little hard to learn because my English is very poor.",4
103376,No complaints. This course revealed im more interested in the interpersonal dynamic of influence and persuasion vs the logic of arguments.,4
103379,"I found this course to be very interesting. I certainly gained a better understanding of arguments, my own shortcomings and steps I can take to improve/put into practice. Thank you.",4
103382,Very engaging lecturer for what could be a very dry subject.In depth analysis and examples,4
103395,"Weekly quizzes instead of just the final (that actually counts for a grade) would be very helpful to me, but it was a great course and I learned a lot!",4
103402,I loved the course and I want to take the othe,4
103412,"An excellent course, but it is hard going (took me 3 attempts to get through the final quiz!). Recommend for anyone interested in how people present arguments.",4
103414,One splendid course ! I thoroughly enjoyed taking it and look forward to the next part of it.,4
103416,Thank you so much to my Professors. I've learned a lot.,4
103424,"Interesting course. It seems to me that we have been learning to play scales before going into music, or learning the names of the letters before learning to read. I wonder how much of all this word by word analysis is useful in real life, real arguing. It is interesting, but it also adds to the difficulty and prompts abandon of the course. Like having to memorize the Periodic Table of Elements before going into the wonders of Chemistry. The Suzuki Method in music or the Silabario Matte (to learn reading in Spanish, starting directly with basic words like ""ojo""=""eye""), show that starting with structural analysis it isn't the only way to learn things.",4
103425,I do enjoy the course through interaction with other participants and like to express my sincere gratitude to Coursera and Duke University.,4
103427,"This is one of the better courses on Cousera. The instructors are passionate, the material is challenging, but well explored and it is one of the most practical courses on logic as it talks about how to form and interpret practical arguments.The only real downside is lack of interaction from mentors/ta's in the forum.",4
103446,Good But slowly repeated times,4
103447,It is may which coming to Doctor way.,4
103450,A very fascinating and enjoyable course! I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to take the first step in learning about cybersecurity.,4
103455,I learned the psychology of implementing security systems.,4
103456,"Excellent course, well explained. Not too much things to learn at once. Ideal when you want to start. Would be useful to have also a slide deck next to it for the review and exam preparation.",4
103463,"would be nice if you could see the questions and answers after you take a quiz or exam, that way its easier to lean where you went wrong on a question.",4
103464,Nice course with more important info,4
103466,"Best course to learn about usable security, If you are familiar with Human Computer Interaction then easily can related the security issue in between Human and Machine.",4
103474,"Covered many topics which are complementary to skills i'm improving or I wanna improve. Also, usability is always something relegated on software engineering so it's valuable to find a course to learn more about it.",4
103485,Very Good course,4
103489,"Instructor was easy to follow, made clear points with today's technology examples and kept me engaged during my time.",4
103499,If there were some Powerpoint slides in the course memorising would have been easier. Thanks a lot.,4
103500,Good Course. But has many generic stuffs. We will get to know about most of the security details that we come across our day today life,4
103505,Jen covers the material well but it isn't the most technical,4
103511,"A totally new insights to security. Since I am a Software Engineer student this concepts are going to prove invaluable in my future tasks. Great tutor and Coursera support, love it.",4
103515,It is one course which should done by each and every one who is using the computer as it talks about daily security problems and this course will let every one aware about how to keep there password and at what duration User should Change there password to keep there System Secure.,4
103516,"I like it, but i feel that sometimes need more examples o dynamic",4
103522,Very useful content that can be used in our workplaces,4
103525,"Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about. Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam, its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind.Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic. Some questions on quizzes weren't explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week. Other than that, a solid course.",4
103526,"This is a basic overview of security issues and user input for web sites, etc. It focuses on design, usability and other issues that affect how people interact with security log-in and other issues.It's a good foundation for looking at your or other's work and knowing the best way for the computer to interact with a user.",4
103527,"this course is cool but not hard enough i think, it should cover more materials and it should be harder.",4
103529,"I think this was a very well-thought out course. In my opinion, it was well presented, contained very useful information, was accessible to someone with a limited background in cybersecurity, and used plenty of real examples to back-up its claims. An area that could use improvement is testing: some of the quizzes provided questions that seemed hard to follow, particularly the ""choose",4
103530,Interesting topics and some very good case studies. But overall I found the course a little repetitive and lacking technical depth.,4
103533,"Great course, with really well-explained and interesting classes. A minor problem was the audio issues, but nothing that would hinder your learning.",4
103536,"I'm not a cyber professional, but I deal with a lot of security issues just as a part of the job. I'm also researching new hardware methods for cyber security systems. I found aspects of this course to be useful to me. Enjoyed the",4
103540,Very interesting and a different approach to make security acceptable to users. Currnet technology allow that,4
103543,A really good course in usable security. A little more of assignments would have been better,4
103545,I just completed the course. This course is recommended to beginners like me because I learned a new perspective to cyber security. It is exciting to see the psychological aspects in cyber security. I would have given more rating if social engineering is explained too. This is just an introduction to the course and may not be appealing for people already in the field which should be expected anyway.,4
103547,Extremely practical lessons that can be applied at work immediately.,4
103549,"Very clear and organized, I will certainly make use of what I learned when writing programs or designing software.",4
103551,"iTS Okay. a few things seem a bit hokey. the interviews etc. But overall, not too bad. Good learning points.But will I pay for this. NO. Mainly b/c its hard to translate it in to a tangible value. No employer will say, OH, you took this class. Let me give you a job or promotion or more money...",4
103559,Great course with a easy way yo learn about Usable Security.,4
103561,"Doesnt meet my expectations - it is all about ""Usable"", but not about ""Security"" at all.",4
103562,"Very informative, easy to understand and gives a clear understanding about the overall concept on usable security.",4
103564,I missed more pratical exercises about it.,4
103565,Gives different perspective on the Cyber Security field.,4
103572,Easy to understand and quick to study. Good general intro to UE,4
103577,It was very well designed and organized but some parts were superficial like module 3. I think it needs more details and explanation.,4
103579,"It's a very basic & foundational course. But very good for someone who's never learnt or done anything in UX before. The course material is simple, breezy and satisfying. I came away having learnt few new things. And the professor kept insisting that this is only foundational program and more advanced material should be pursued elsewhere. I recommend this course to all beginners of UX.",4
103584,This is literally the introduction. It covered things i mostly knew. But its a good starting point for those who have no idea about the UX industry.,4
103586,Great Intro course that goes over most the general concepts of UX design. It's a good starting place to get your feet wet in this field.,4
103587,Very nice introductory knowledge.,4
103592,Good beginner level course - useful for those interested in getting an early understanding of the field of UX before they decide on whether this field is right for them or not.Having said that the course has been kept easy to understand and quick...,4
103594,It's a good introductory course,4
103605,"It is a fundamental class, quite easy to understand for people who don't have any background about user experience.",4
103607,"A good simple introduction which also lists some useful resources. Well presented, logical and clear.",4
103608,"A very very basic but complete introduction for anyone who just wondering what UX is, or who want to structural his/her own practice in a logical and systematic manner.It also shows ideas if you want to understand deeper.Took me one day to go through the whole course. FYI.",4
103616,It is very useful course,4
103617,Explaining each and every steps was good. I feel it would have been better if some visual elements in the course material which will us to understand faster than the current teaching practice.,4
103620,It seems to be good introduction to get to know basics of UX. I would it be a little bit more attractive and enjoyable but all in all it's good as first step to UX.,4
103624,It was a good introductory course. I am giving 4 stars so that the design cycle goes around again and make the course more effortless and enjoyable.,4
103631,"It's a good introduction to UX Design, especially if you don't know anything about the field. It gives you the basics and the lingo that you will encounter in this field. It would have been nice to have some practical assignments, but overall really good start.",4
103634,"A bit short, did help with structuring the UX process but I feel it was very very basic so probably more suitable to people that just start their journey in UXland",4
103645,Thanks!,4
103647,This course is a very informative & comprehensive course for Beginners. it covers the foundational aspects of UX design. Thanks to Dr. Rosa I. Arriaga & Georgia Institute of Technology.,4
103649,An Informative Introductory course.,4
103650,"Fast and practical. When I wanted to learn the basics of UX, this course gave me all the important elements I need to understand. Plus, I was able to start sketching right away and implement my ideas at work.",4
103651,"I would LOVE to give this course 5 stars because I absolutely loved it. However, one small thing that drove me nuts makes me give it 4 star rating. I am a big type A personality and I wanted a perfect 100% grade. For this reason I take very, very detailed notes and studied very hard. When I was taking the tests, all of the answers came to me and I knew they were right without question. Then I would get marked wrong some answers at the end. For example, there were several questions relating to the 4 phases of the design cycle. These should very easy answers as the question was usually ""What follows after the 'alternative design phase"" which is an easy answer, ""prototyping"". Regardless it would be marked wrong, and it was absolutely impossible to get 100% and I encountered this issue on about 3 questions. I would encourage you to make sure your answers are properly programmed into the response bank",4
103658,I think this was a 5 star course in 2015/2016. The course should have been updated to get 5 stars in 2017.,4
103659,Nice content. Gives a overview of the smartphone technologies. Recommended tutorial! Thanks Coursera and Yonsei University for this course.,4
103660,The course could have more content.,4
103663,Very detailed course touching on many concepts and topics in mobile technologies . A vert good course for beginners in this area to give you just an overview without going into too technical or workings of the detail and technologies. Excellent thank you.,4
103666,awesome this only world i have . i have learned great,4
103668,Course could be a little more challenging but it is pretty much up-to-date and very well presented,4
103670,"Amazing Content for newbies , I do recommend these for business leaders as well.",4
103680,It is a fantastic course. I loved it. It fits my interests.,4
103681,Great for novices.,4
103682,Interesting and fun to learn,4
103685,Well information,4
103687,I found this course enjoyable and easy to follow along with.,4
103697,"Good intro, but the quizzes could be more challenging.",4
103702,repeating slides,4
103703,A very basic course for smartphone technology. For a laymen its good choice to cover all basics but not for a technical person.,4
103704,Well presented seemed a little weak on latest Android versions. But some info on tablets was a nice bonus. Definitely recommend to anyone trying to understand smartphones and the differences between Apple and Android versions.,4
103705,Very good about smart phone,4
103707,Good if you want to know in detail about the smartphones development history and lots of basic things,4
103708,This course is informative and helpful to get the basic insight in smartphone technologies.,4
103715,A brief introduction to all the need to know's about smartphones from day 1 providing enough detail for any audience. Would definetely suggest taking notes or watching again for people new to the concept. For me a good review of every smartphone technology. Thank you,4
103723,although the teacher must be using android phone but it does not influence its a nice lecture,4
103724,"Information in this course is thorough and comprehensive. The material is entirely composed of the specifications, release and feature development, and comparison of Android OS and iOS. The instructor shows slides and reads the slides in their entirety. There is no additional information the instructor provides that is not already included in the slide content. The teaching is not very stimulating. But the instructor does cover the material completely.",4
103728,"This is an excellent course to get some basic knowledge about the iOS and Android history, when and how this systems developed their unique features, or how that influenced products in whole. Yet, quizzes are a bit boring. They require you to actually know history of evolving features tied to exact dates/versions.",4
103730,Good course,4
103747,I'm not sure who this course was aimed at since there was a heavy use of technical vocabulary to describe many things someone with that level of vocabulary should know. I already knew most of the course material but I learned some new things as well. It would have been one star less but it being a short course which only took me a few hours to complete made me enjoy the experience more,4
103751,"Thank you a very good overview of all the features and history of smartphones - iOS and Android.Some explanation of some of these features would have been usefulAlso, please consider Microsoft as well",4
103755,Nice overview with detail on smartphones. The course cover a lot of detail and history of the OS's but can get a little monotonous over the different stages of the OS. Sometimes felt like just reading features. Overall I liked the course and thought it provide a very nice overview.,4
103768,"Not as powerful as Part I, but definitely a must for business people and entrepreneurs. Very interesting subject and great professor. Take growth to the next level...",4
103778,Very interesting thank you.,4
103789,"it's nicely designed, but it would be great if the course designers have their input in evaluating our projects and most importantly updating the material to the latest swift version as this is the whole purpose of why one would register in this course.",4
103791,Great Course for learning Swift,4
103792,Great intro,4
103795,"A good course for wetting your feet in the world of app development. I'll this course was enjoyable and I learned many practical skills. With that said though, for someone completely new to programming I could see this being tough, and there were a few times instructions were slightly vague. Also with it being an outdated version of swift, switching to the latest version isn't seamless. All in all, I enjoyed the course for what it offered, and would suggest it to any programmer looking to pick up this new language.",4
103797,Good course to learn the Swift basics.,4
103800,Nice to start programming with swift.,4
103804,"Good pace, comprehensive introduction to language. Makes it easy to get started learning Swift.",4
103806,Solid course with beginner information about swift programming language and some small projects in swift.,4
103822,"I am enjoying the class. I'm taking it simultaneously with some of the others in the specialization, which is I think the right decision. It's a great quick intro, but it's definitely not ideal for newbies to programming.",4
103825,This course has good interactivity),4
103827,"It's very interesting and useful to learn for Swift programming. And through this course, I realized what objective oriented programming is.",4
103830,Pretty good basic course. Not that good as classic Scala Functional Programming (being simply awesome) but still good.,4
103838,"Nice course, with rather fast pace!",4
103852,"The course is overall very useful and I learned a lot, although a component of self-learning is essential to succeed. I think it would be ideal if the peer assignment would allow more shades in the grading, other than ""Yes"" or ""No"".",4
103856,Required things about the swift programming language needed for iOS development is present in this course,4
103858,"The course is good, but in my opinion, it's too basic for people who are already developers (in platforms other than iOS). Hopefully the next course in the serie will be a little bit deeper.",4
103861,This is very well course that tell you how can you programming in Swift. It's interesting.,4
103874,"Since it is an introduction to Swift programming I believe it should contain more information about particular topics, not in depth but essence of course. You have provided a official Swift Apple documentation, so I'm wondering why this short course if It's necessary (read not necessary to know everything for beginning) to know everything about Swift language.",4
103875,"Pleased with the course. Well described all the videos and very understandable examples as well. Although no example codes were given so that's why I give a 4 stars. But I highly recommend it. I had a background in Objective-C and I was wondering how to start with Swift, and I think it was a good way to start. Thank you.",4
103879,"I liked it, everything is well described, clear and helpful.The last assignment description is not clear. The Peer Review reviewing criteria is not clear as well. It could be understood by many ways. They should enhance the peer review instructions.",4
103884,"Although I've programming experience, this course's assignment is not easy to complete.I recommend to study Object-oriented language such as Java or C++ before taking this course.",4
103890,The content is absolutely amazing. What I didn't really like was that the last assignment was a curve ball to me and most of the other students in my class. There was very little preparation to it and thus took a while to understand how to get started on it.,4
103892,Too easy.,4
103893,Nice easy introduction. If you've already got a programming background.,4
103895,"This is a well designed course that is clear in what it focuses on to give you a good foundation. That said, there is so much more to learn.Make sure you look at the final project after each module to get an idea for all the opportunities to apply the optional materials. You can still pass without doing using the concepts in the optional sections but there is time to get even more out of the final project if you prepare and explore.",4
103897,Course is good but the early weeks need to be more challenging. 70% of the work was in the last week.,4
103902,"This is a great starter course, the Reading Materials are a great way to learn directly from the source with a clearer understanding thanks to the videos. Thank you!",4
103906,"Great course first of all.One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures. The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift,which are really useful, but they are not comprehensive enough. So for most of the students, I believe, will have to do a lot of self-studying to finish the final project.But still, the final project is challenging and interesting. Swift is not a hard language to learn, so after went through all the lectures and read some books on Swift programming, I was able to finish the project.",4
103908,"This course is good to start with Swift programming in IOS. this had help me a lot, while not having much time to devote. I appreciate this.",4
103910,Not much interaction between the instructors and students. Course videos were very helpful.,4
103911,Good Course! This class is for people who know how to program (intermediate to advance software programmers),4
103925,"i had no idea of swift, or even not much idea about oop. Got good idea of swift.. assignments can be improved.",4
103926,A great introductory course to Swift!,4
103928,Good Course. A bit short but goes straight to the point.,4
103929,Awesome course with great explanation,4
103938,"it's nice intro to swift, but i recommend that you'd add reading the swift book from apple as people go through the course, even as ""to understand more"" option, thanks a lot for the course.",4
103940,Nice course but a but a bit hard when you have no programming skills. In fact I do have some programming skill and found it hard to follow. I would also add more exercise to do than Quizzes.,4
103941,"The videos were a bit unfocused, but over all I learned a good amount about Swift, and appreciate many of it's design decisions.",4
103946,Good compact introduction.,4
103948,"Was pretty good overall. I feel there was a lack of in-lecture questions in the first few videos. That aside, great course.",4
103949,"Quite fun, easy and quick.But I already had some object oriented programming knowledge.",4
103956,"Nice course, but would be better if the examples were thought through before demonstration, rather than do it extempore.",4
103969,"Classes were entertaining, but sometimes a little messy.",4
103972,Hope next courses will be more detailed.It is hard to understand some things without experience.,4
103983,"Unnecessary with the Swift vs Objective C session, did not provide any value - otherwise fairly good basic course",4
103992,"Good way to start learning swift. I hope other concepts will be explained in the next courses, but I have to say this course is held very well.",4
103998,Awesome basic course,4
104019,good course,4
104024,"Great way to learn about subtleties of working with global teams around the world and excel in these environments. As well, the details and how to leverage the power of crow",4
104027,"Good explanation of concepts, would be better if add more interaction",4
104032,interesting course. Leaves you wanting to read and learn more about social computing.,4
104034,"Great course, but a bit short.",4
104037,"I found the course very interesting. The weekly assignments were a great challenge, but lacked reference to some reading on the subject.When I went quiz I've found that most of the questions had to do with concepts that weren't covered in the videos. I think that this courser should have further readings about these concepts.",4
104048,Very useful and thought provoking course.,4
104049,Loved the course! Will definitely try to get my hands on further material to study more.,4
104052,Gotta watch how the test questions are formulate as it can be overly deceiving......,4
104053,the assignments wasn't that good,4
104054,THE COURSE IS GOOD.,4
104057,Good course. Especially enjoyed the crowdsourcing lectures.,4
104058,"I think this course was inspiring and motivating. I learned a lot regarding the social computing, learned about websites I haven't heard till now, l found more about exploring and searching and the utilization of internet tools. The only reason I gave this course 4 stars is because one of my assignments (week 2 that is), did not get any reviews....Thank you for the experience!",4
104066,"I had benefited this course a lot ,interviews were great ,a lot of insights .Really good",4
104067,"The course was a great introduction into the subject of strategic planning and execution. I really appreciated the very high quality course replication, clear speech and sufficient detailed slides to accompany the subject matter.",4
104082,"Great materials, variety of speakers, lectures,examples and models !! Thank you.",4
104084,Broadens my view of how to solve public health problems involving multiple stakeholders and actors,4
104085,A very hands on approach to systems thinking that introduces you to modeling software for real life use.,4
104088,"Every one in charge of leading, coordinating, managing public health activities, especially at higher level &/or in developing countries, must take such training. Because this helps any one to avoid rigidity in using his/her authority or helps understand what effects might have their decisions in the community and starts to think contextually plus systematically.Every one is not right or wrong there should be a check up mechanism in order to converge every ones perspectives included in the system and at least respected to minimise later on resistance for the success our ""good mission"".",4
104099,I enjoyed this course very much. I rate 4/5 because I would liked a broader explanation on how to translate Stock and Flow Diagrams to mathematical models.,4
104105,It was a nice and informative experience. It was a good introductory to basic concepts and skills which base the way for further reading on the subject.,4
104112,"While focused on the subject of public health systems, this course is also a good experience for anybody who is simply interested in the benefits of systems thinking and the applications of causal models. While there are a few hiccups in the course content (a couple files not available as of Mar 2016), the overall experience here is excellent. The instructors break down each topic into understandable elements and provide excellent real world examples. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this course and recommend it to others.",4
104115,"Very comprehensive as an introductory course. The content is very actual and the lectures' flow is objective. Also, I liked the quiz inside the lectures as they helped in retain the subject. I have some hard difficulties with the mathematics as I'm very rusty with the mathematics (more than 30 years of rust). I'm from the compute science area so I would like to see more practice in algorithms. However, I would like to congratulate the Stanford University and Cousera teams for the course. Great job.",4
104117,"A very good introduction in social and economic networks.I recommend this course to everyone that wants to learn how networks are formed, understand the basic concepts and get an intuition on the possible networks that he/she could form.The professor is talking clearly so you won't have a problem in understanding him.One thing that was missing for me was in Week 2 when he was talking about ""eigenvector centrality"", for me the most objective measure, the explanation was really poor and you could never understand the concept based on what the lesson offered.",4
104120,The course is vast. The Professor is to the point and doesn't lack knowledge in his field.I'd recommend this course for anyone interested in Economics. Loved it.,4
104121,"A bit tough, but really worth the effort.",4
104128,"Very complex topic, very well presented. The materials are great! Would have been better to made mathematics pre-requisite clearer.",4
104135,"It's a quiet complex topic in general terms. It is well covered, but In my opinion there should be at least an exercise per video, explaining something similar to the in-video questions. It should have a demonstrative part rather than just talking about it and showing the formula.",4
104142,I found significant improvement of my grammar after having attended.,4
104150,"The course is well structured and quite informative. Instructors bring in real life situations to use different tenses, this is helpful for the learners as it is relatable. The only draw back is that our work is corrected by the other learners and that correction is final. I scored 98% in the final assignment as the other learners assessed it and they didn't give me the correct score. I wish I could appeal to re-check it!",4
104183,"Well planned and with exciting activities, the capstone was a great final step for the course!",4
104194,Simply Awesome.,4
104196,Excelent! But I miss the interaction with the teacher.,4
104197,The teacher guided us to the basic of game world design. Give us the material of how to design the game world.,4
104198,"Very useful to develop worlds and enviroments, not only for videogames, but for all kind of media.",4
104205,"Good course content. However, the classes feel a little short for such a long topic.",4
104214,Contents were short and great but some tools and practicle s/w should be introduced in it.,4
104223,"Very intresting and fun, learned a lot. I just wish there´d be more examples of finished designers worlds and how they look like.",4
104233,"Even though it is a great course by itself, I have to look at it as a part of the whole specialization, and in that context it's just a little bit more abstract and undefined than the previous ones.All in all, great course and fantastic specialization for now.",4
104235,"In general the course was really good, I just had the problem that some points weren't as clearly explained as I wished them to be. It's a bit hard to follow up, since sometimes the examples are not what is asked for in the homework and there's nothing to compare your work to, so the student as well as the grading peers are not always sure what is important in the assignment. Add some more examples and explain them directly, I think that would help a lot. :)",4
104237,"Very good and informative course. I liked it mostly because of how it explains the ways one can create the video game world we desire and what must be taken into account. I already had prior knowledge on how to create a video game world that was consistent, but this reinforced what I already knew and took it a bit further. Very recommended for those who are beginners and want to learn how to create a world that feels real and is consistent throughout a game.",4
104241,"The course focuses on a number of critical aspects in video game world design, such as artistic direction, spatial and ""physical"" rules, and movement considerations; and it teaches a few methods of planning them. That said, the presentation of these ideas and methods feels less organized than the others in the course. That said, all of them are useful, and if the exercises/submissions don't quite lead up to as organic a whole as the others, it makes up for it by covering bases with varied approaches.",4
104248,"Compare to Last Course in this Specialization this course lacked the good pace through the assignments, they were out of pace or out of tune, and also there were mostly general talks more than tips to make the student get in to the flow and create a better work, All in All it was Great but compared to the course before it, it had issues :D",4
104249,"The teacher is a litlle abstract. Maybe he would improve himself if he would give more tangible things, as methods.",4
104256,I really enjoyed the course.Opened my eyes for many things that I didn't gave much though while design my games.,4
104264,"I had good assignments, but less content than I expected.",4
104272,great and informative course :) really enjoyed it,4
104275,"i really like the material, i feel that i learning the basic of video game development",4
104280,Interesting!,4
104284,"This course is totally recommended for developers and architects no matter the programming language you use.In my opinion, the only thing that I missed was a project for the penetration testing week.Contents are very well teached and the interviews were awesome.",4
104285,"Learnt a lot. Quite a lot of background required esp. if you've never debugged/analyzed memory locations/ of C programs before. I'm a web developer and write php in my day to day, with a little experience in C++. Being able to read C code wasn't too much of a problem. Very hard, however, was figuring out how to use gdb properly to analyze/ debug -- to calculate the distance between two memory locations, for example. That wasn't something I cared to anguish over.",4
104289,Excellent intro course with 3 semi-challenging and fun projects,4
104290,"The course is great but it would be better to have it over 8 weeks to diffuse the amount of valuable information in Week 5. Also, charts should be numbered for easier references in discussions.",4
104296,tres bon merci beaucoup,4
104318,Very good course. Very good introduction to some interesting concepts in software security. Well explained. Maybe introduce more practical exercises. They could also include references to places where you can practice the concepts learned. For example repositories as vulnhub and others are sites where you can put into practice exercises. It however is a course that is very well explained ...,4
104327,"This course on software security was very informative . This is the best place to start off for a beginner as it not only covers the technical aspects of security ,but also talks about modelling threats and identifying adversaries and their capabilities.I however was slightly disappointed with the testing methods of this course.I feel that most of the testing should have been on the basis of projects and a project should have been included every week .But, all in all taking the course was a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly enjoyed all the projects that were given.Looking forward to taking the next course in the specialization!!",4
104331,Could have gone more deeper in some of the topics which were covered at very high level. Overall a good introduction to the subject matter.,4
104332,"This is a tough course. Tough because I had no experience in C or C++. My background is dot-net and visual basic. It's been study C++ 5 hours a day and take the course 2 hours a day. I made it. The professor is spot on when he says a C++ background is needed. But I made it.If you have the required background you'll find it's a good basis for understanding the multiple vulnerabilities in this code, what they are and how they work. (You better understand stacks and heaps and pointers real well)Worth the time and the effort. Cheers to University if Maryland for making it available and to Professor Hicks for his hard work.",4
104333,"Some parts of the course were more advanced (Program Analysis), while some briefly touched the topic (Penetration Testing). Web Application Security was almost there, while Low Level Security was just right!Keep up the good work, recommended +++++",4
104340,"Awesome! It would have been nicer to go deeper into the practical, pen testing part, but I enjoyed this course anyway.",4
104368,"A great course, learned a lot but due to not being in a position to purchase the certificate OI could not submit quizzes or assignments, such a shame as I could not get feedback",4
104379,"The course material and the instructor's lectures are excellent. However the quizzes are programmed incorrectly--marking wrong answers right and right answers wrong too often.I gained a few skills that I now put to use when writing songs. The course also provided some insightful information on prosody, phrasing, and a little bit of history. It was definitely worth the time I invested in doing this course.",4
104394,"I liked your course. It is very thorough, but the stories and acting parts get a bit cheesy. I would have appreciated a course more finely tuned to serious learners. It seems geared towards high schoolers.",4
104429,Great course with helpful information. Thank you!,4
104431,Nice and interactive,4
104435,"Great, I just didn't like editing old stuff - I'd have preferred them asking for separate writing and reading lessons.",4
104437,"Is a great Course with excellent teachers and a great approach for everyone, using all the types of learning for all the types of learners.",4
104463,"Really liked the funny, old professor who gives most of the lectures. Good info.",4
104473,"Covered a broad range of religious beliefs about the afterlife. Solid overview of Darwin and evolution as well as good videos e.g. Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris. The videos of actual classroom delivery with students provided a realism to the online experience. Both profs. were excellent teachers with the necessary skills to handle sensitive topics.The course could be improved by more clearly written assignments. The content of these assignments was appropriate but the word structure was too vague and in some cases disjointed.Excellent course. Well done Rutgers.",4
104486,Very Informative and logical. Loved Prof. Daniel Ogilvie lectures,4
104491,Very interesting and rare class!,4
104494,I enjoyed the course. It gave a good historical look at the foundations of religion. I'm looking forward to Unit 2.,4
104502,Amazing course touching areas where I also often debated with myself.,4
104503,I sincerely appreciate the enormous effort and encouragement of Prof. Daniel M. Ogilvie and Prof. Leonard W. Hamilton. A sincere hug and my gratitude.,4
104508,"A new course with new material. The course is in the beginning stages of evolution, just like the human psyche. Perhaps someone will refine it in time but it is a very good course, especially considering nothing quite like this has been presented before.",4
104514,A very interesting course.,4
104518,"I loved the beginning of the course and the information about Darwin. I may agree with Dawson, but I find him too darn smug. I once watched a documentary about intelligent design, Another scientist told him how lucky he was to have such fame, wealth, and good health, He asked him if he died and found a God,what would he think? Dawson's answer was and I'm not exactly quoting but he",4
104528,"This was the most challenging of the five courses as there are quite a few statistical principles to grasp along with some fairly lengthy equations for a non-maths type like me. Enjoyed the course and the content along with its delivery. If there is one thing I would suggest is that there was too much repetitive spreadsheet work in the assignments which became a little tedious. Overall, a very good course.",4
104539,Entertaining way of teaching a complex subject,4
104542,"very interesting, challenging, but I find it hard to understand the intonation (highs and lows) of the ph",4
104547,It is interesting.,4
104555,"Great course! It covers many aspects of web development and it is really helpful that you can see a complex application being created line by line. The only issue that kept me from giving 5 stars is the assignments. Frankly, they are too simple! They don't give you the chance to repeat the techniques shown in the videos and comprehend these complex and for some of us new topics. Many thanks!",4
104561,"Very good introduction to Meteor. Should be updated to newer Meteor version, lots of things have changed in the official guidelines in the meantime.",4
104569,"This was informative, but there were some issues with the final project that could have used some more guidance.",4
104573,"The final project for this one was difficult but within reason, as it should be.",4
104597,Great course!! It's really useful.,4
104620,"Best course in the specialization so far. Well thought out and explained. The course still has the same problem with quiz questions being at times obtuse, but overall it's a really good course.",4
104622,Great cours !,4
104624,Great Course,4
104628,"Enjoying it, but missed out a bit before...",4
104634,Course was a fulfilling refresher course. Presentation was direct and easy to comprehend course material. Only downfall is the lack of a course forum for participates to communicate with others to get further instruction in areas of need.,4
104636,The course is not free but qualitative and quantitative.,4
104639,A nice effort. good if more interactive lessons,4
104641,Very clear and concise lessons. I learned so much. But I wish there were lessons for graphing trigonometric functions.,4
104644,"This course is very good!!! My only complaint is that this course only has a ""reading option"" with a handful of short videos. The short videos are EXTREMELY helpful because I learn from both hearing and seeing. Thus, I learn best when I see the problem being worked out.It is 10x more helpful to me when I SEE the problem being worked out AS WELL AS HEAR them explaining the process. I watched the videos over and over again to grasp and excel in the concept. However, with two hours of just plain reading assigned... I found it harder to grasp. It didn't show the problem being worked out... although it does EXPLAIN the process. I just feel as though at the very least there should have been a listening option/text to speech option, or otherwise have the readings broken up into videos.",4
104645,i am not understanding the the materia,4
104646,I have enjoyed this course.,4
104649,I saw a few typos and missing translations in the English transcripts. One minor issue in a quiz/test.,4
104650,"I found the course very helpful in terms of vocabulary and grammar and I will continue practicing with it. There are a few errors here and there that need to be corrected in the quizzes and such. The main issue is that while it is billed as a vocabulary course, and starts with simple concepts, it is more of an intermediate than a beginner course for someone who has never studied a foreign language before. It is more like a course for padding out your vocabulary and practicing grammatical constructions than a language learning course.",4
104664,"some lectures were very american-reality-oriented, the terms were very difficult to understand, although the information provided was very useful Thanks!",4
104668,"Course was quite helpful, but it is good for only beginners. Thanks for Offering this course.",4
104670,Amazing as the other courses. But I think too superficial on building financial projections. Information hard to find.,4
104692,"I really liked it, the teacher's explanation are clear and motivational.",4
104697,Excellent course and materials well researched!,4
104704,Great Course!!,4
104705,That's a great course with a lot of updated information about the terrorism in the world.,4
104708,Great course! The information was great. I enjoyed the format and the instructor was great.,4
104724,"This course is well worthwhile. Its main objective is make you think about ethical issues, as opposed to making decisions in a rote manner. Their argument about ethical blindness is persuasive and it helps you to understand corporate behaviors that appear to be inconceivable (Enron, Ford Pinto, etc).My hope was to learn more about guidelines for making corporate decisions that have internal economic costs or benefits, with associated external social benefits or costs. However, I was assured that this would not be possible in the confines of this course. But this course does make you hungry for more. Hopefully, this faculty will be able to offer a follow-up course in the near future.",4
104730,Great course. Fantastic lecturers and the whole approach of the course on how to tackle important decisions when there is an ethical side.,4
104735,Really worth investing time into!!!,4
104741,"It was easy to understand, it has nice rityhm to follow",4
104745,"Interesting and well structured course!Started off great, felt like needed a boost in the endOverall a valuable course",4
104748,Interesting concepts - but gets a little repetitive,4
104753,Nicely started but bit hurried up at the end,4
104757,It is good but you have to study by yourself using different material as the video contents are not enough to understand the subject,4
104758,"I think the ""homework"" exercises are a very good idea, butsince the course is very fast paced, more exercises are needed.",4
104760,"Statistics was relatively new to me, so it was a steep learning; Overall I liked it.",4
104762,Challenging course but very helpful.,4
104772,"Nice course, but need more detailed one for those new to statistics.",4
104774,"Difficult class, moving through a heavy amount of statistics material, but very useful. May be helpful to take this course more slowly and look for other online sources to supplement the lecture material.",4
104775,"For the length of time of this course, I though it did a good job of covering the topics. Luckily, I've had multiple previous courses on this material. I only wish there were more homeworks/project covering the analysis of real data with less theoretical work.",4
104780,"For starters, it will demand a lot of out of class studies. It took me three months to go through the basics in Khan Academy before attempting it - and after that it was straight forward.",4
104787,Basic statistics course....could have been a requisite,4
104794,"I would say it is good quality content and appreciate the efforts of the authors . Though it just introduces the topic , it better to follow up with more rigorous online content/book, in order to understand the topic more deeply .",4
104804,The course is useful and essential not only for those studying statistics but machine learning,4
104808,Great Course. Material much more challenging than courses in the program to date.,4
104809,"Good course. It could be more clear and deep in some concepts, especially in the final part of week 4.",4
104815,the course provides the necessary information and practice assignments to build a grasp of the topic. It seems a little fast paced and people from non-statistics background may find it a bit difficult.,4
104816,Very informative lecture and Brian explained concepts pretty well. Thanks..,4
104817,"It's not the math that is hard, it's the phrasing, vocabulary and semantics.",4
104820,Difficult one. But made it.,4
104822,"I am interested in taking the Regression Models course and took this one as a refreshment for the statistics knowledge I already had. I found the course well done and the resources easy to use and throughout.As a negative point I would mention that as the topics get more involved, the time dedicated to each one seems to decrease, to the point where both MULTIPLE TESTING and GROUP COMPARISONS are pretty much a briefing, which kind of defeates the purpose of including them on the course in the first place...I give the course a 8.5 out of 10.",4
104823,"I thought the course material was great but I think the grading criteria for the assignment should be more rigorous and check for proper methodology/application of techniques, just because I'd like to know that my approach to a given data analysis is sound and that the conclusions I draw from running tests, p-value adjustment, calculating power, etc. are statistically valid.Overall a great primer! Thanks to Brian & Jeff for putting this together :)",4
104829,GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF USING STATISTIC TEST IN R. HOPE TO ADD MORE MATERIAL,4
104834,Probably more math than required at this stage,4
104835,"This was the toughest of all the Data Science courses so far. Without the statistical inference book, the practical exercises and the swirls it would have been very challenging to pass the course. These were very valuable tools. The videos that are available when I couldn't get a practical exercise right, also helped me a lot.I majored in mathematical statistics 40 years ago, but have never used it in my whole career. But in my opinion this course explained the concepts much better than how it was done 40 years ago. Congratulations to everybody involved.I have learned so much and was really proud of myself when I passed this one.",4
104836,a basic course of inference but i think perfecto for this mooc,4
104846,"It is nice course!Amazingly challenging, thought provoking.",4
104848,Sometimes videos was difficult to understand. I needed to watch most of lectures twice. On other hand it was worth doing and I've learned basic statistics.,4
104849,"The course on statistical inference is a crash course on frequentist statistics; in my opinion the contents are appropriate for statistical inference, though most of the concepts that are taught deserve more attention, or perhaps split throughout other courses.Nevertheless, Brian makes a terrific job to compress all of these topics into a single month course which is impressive - for someone familiar with statistics it's actually an enjoyable course.",4
104859,"If, like me, you do not have an understanding of the subject matter then you may struggle to complete this in the time frame. I had to retake this multiple times and found getting the basics (From Khan) first then returning helped me finally understand and pass the tests.",4
104861,"I liked this course, and found the lectures interesting and would give them perfect marks on being instructive. However, I found that there are some speling errors here and there, and a remarkable frequency of sirens audible in the lectures (is JHU in a difficult neighborhood?), and sometimes it was hard to recover the plots from the git repository.But, more importantly the curriculum and teach was very good, and the use of examples after the theory makes it much easier to grasp difficult concepts.",4
104862,"Touches all the key concepts of statisticas inference. A bit challenging, even more if you don't have previous knowledge of statistics.",4
104870,"This was a real crash course on statistics and math theory and, giving also all the tools for data analyses. It might be nice to have more 'common language' examples, that would connect ideas of population and distribution to solving real life problems and taking real life decisions.",4
104872,Good course. Very interesting.pace is very high,4
104882,"Great course, could use some review though. Still give it a big thumbs up!",4
104885,A foundation course for data scientists! Basic statistics from University of Amsterdam on Coursera would be nice pre-requisite to this one !,4
104888,"This course actually helped me to practice and to obtain a better intuition of the most basic Statistical Inference ideas. It covers up little content, but it focuses more on the practical understanding than on the maths. After taking it I feel like I can go and take a much more math-heavy course and I wont feel lost.",4
104890,"Content was Great, difficult to understand some times. I had to review more sources to get the clearer idea.Totally enjoyed the challenge.",4
104893,"good curse, but it's hard by short time to study all lessons and practice it.",4
104894,"It is a good course, well taught. A full comprehension of the subjects however needs more work and research than what is needed to pass the course.",4
104908,"The topics from this course are very important and might be considered convoluted at times, so it is nice to see that Brian makes them actually easy to understand. Very comprehensive and has nice examples.",4
104910,It was a pretty good course with really great examples. I feel the instruction was a bit too droll and mechanical.,4
104914,This session will help me boost my skills.,4
104925,Have not taken the class but paid late in the session for the remainder of the specialization. Cannot get the 3/21 session which is what I planned on enrolling into. No help on the Coursera site. Maybe this will trigger a response,4
104929,"This course took me 3 weeks longer than anticipated, and I'm not sure it was the difficulty of the material. A lot of this information is review for me, so I am confused why it took so much time to complete. There were new topics, and I did enjoy working through the homework questions.",4
104942,Good refresher course. It'd be a little steep of a learning curve for someone new to hypothesis testing/confidence intervals in four weeks.,4
104953,"Very challenging and very valuable as a learning experience. I really liked it and fortunately I passed. I did think it was a bit too fast-paced in some places though. It is so much theoretical and mathematical stuff that it would have been all right to spend 2 months rather than 1, and learn a little bit more in-depth with a little more space for practice and assignments.",4
104954,Very good class to get a feel for statistics,4
104956,"Perhaps I'm holding the video lectures to too high of a standard set by Roger Peng in previous courses, but the videos are difficult to follow. I can see the effort is clearly put in, but all the actions going on during the videos are distracting at times.",4
104957,"Have some duplicated video, and some swirl problems",4
104959,"This is course is well written , the Lecturer notes are very handy and Swirl Lessons give us Hands on Experience in Practical Implementation.Thanks for the instructors",4
104961,This was probably the most difficult and challenging course . Had to pull out my old stats books to remember most of it. Using R to do what we used to do with TI-83's was great!,4
104962,Maybe the instructor could illustrate more,4
104968,We need more examples on datasets.,4
104969,"I wish there was more R programming focus. I feel like there was a lot of theory, and then a blanket ""t.test will cover this"" treatment of implementation in R.",4
104975,"I found this to be a tough class and had to take it twice, but it was worth the effort. It's tough if you're new to statistics. Starts easy enough but make the time to read additional references, articles, and online videos outside the course.",4
104982,"I think you can get a lot from this course, but you have to deploy a reasonable amount of time to find for yourself more in depth concepts elsewhere",4
105003,"How to Change the World is a good introductory course to create awareness about some of the most important issues of our world nowadays. The lectures, leaded by Prof. Michael Roth, showcase interesting conversations with other experts about their attempts to make positive change in the world, and the weekly assignments are a good way for students to synthesise the learning of each week.As a downside, I found very little participation in the discussion forums. I would have liked to discuss more about the different topics of each week. Also, the lectures, while interesting, were sometimes a bit long-winded, and I did not like the fact that some conversations were divided over several videos.In general, I have enjoyed the course and doing the assignments, and also reading and reviewing my peers' work. I would suggest re-editing the video lectures in a bit more synthesised and self-contained pieces, and perhaps to spice up the discussion forums with some initial threads by the moderators.Finally, I would like to say thanks to Prof. Michael Roth for its incredible effort in bringing together all the guest speakers and for making available this course for everyone in the world.Miguel R. C.",4
105005,"Very good and interesting course. The assignments could have been a little more difficult for me, but it was good tht they made you think about how you can improve yourself and how you can help others. Also reading each others assignments was really helpful and inspiring.",4
105011,Another great course 2nd best after managing an agile team. Great content and presenters with useful recommendations.,4
105016,Great course!,4
105017,Valuable experience. Well composed. Not designed for Sales and Product Managers though.,4
105018,The last assignment is hard to do if you have just pretend project not real one. But whole course is really good.,4
105026,I study this course still.,4
105035,The only thing that this course needs is more consistency/clarity using the constant with regards to state variables.,4
105043,New Models of Business in Society is a very good way to understand what is coming now in business and why and how we can achieve it. Thanks prof. Freeman!,4
105048,"Not extreme depth, but enjoyable and thought provoking.",4
105058,Good course! Ask you to think out of the box and bring some new concepts and perspectives to the table.,4
105070,"And enthusiastic presenter on a subject which I've not had exposure to - supported by some interesting short interviews.I found the sessions less academically challenging than other Coursera's - but that is probably OK because of the nature of the course.It's not an essential course in my life, but interesting and probably a good starting point for MOOC newbies. And I'll be checking back to see if the Prof appears in something else.",4
105072,I did enjoining this curriculum.,4
105081,"I felt this course was stimulating, thought provoking and challenging. The course for me was about awareness more than just passing the quizzes. I felt the interviews were especially interesting. It is my hope that as I move towards opening my own business I keep many of these principles in mind.",4
105085,"A concise and inspiring course, urging to cast a critical eye on the prevailing ""business-is-all-about-shareholder-value"" mindset and to redirect it towards a sustainable, moral, stakeholder oriented approach",4
105088,Nice overview of some newly prevailing business concepts,4
105090,Very insightful course.,4
105091,very useful course,4
105093,"There wasn't a list of suggested Reading, but It is really motivating to make the difference in bus",4
105098,It's inspiring necause defines how business should be donde now days not as an utopia but us a reality that everyone must apply.,4
105100,"I am so glad to take this course and share ""stakeholders "" as a strategy more than a theory.Thanks!",4
105104,"Very nice course. Provides inspiration than actual knowldge, but this was the professor's aim in the first place.I highly recomend this course to everyone, entrepreneur or not.",4
105112,This course presents many alternatives to traditional models of business.,4
105121,I took this course as something that would give me some additional knowledge on business and it got me looking into the sources and main themes the instructor talks about more. I have so far come away more informed than what I was expecting for sure. Highly recommend it,4
105129,"Great and inspirational course. Thank you Prof Freeman for your approach that is making us think, reflect and question the current models of businesses in our societies!",4
105131,"The content shown in the video lectures is a very nice overview of the subject but it feels somehow superficial, some more depth would be really appreciated.",4
105132,We are just beginning to tap into the Sharing Economy. This course gave me lots of valuable updates and new knowledge to better understand the change is business that is transforming the way we live and prosper at the same time as we together take care of the world around us.,4
105133,my idea about business really changedthe way of teaching is so coolthere are a lot of creative ideas in the course,4
105135,Gives a simple and clear overview of different business models and their impact on society.,4
105148,I enjoyed the course very much. The critiques were the most important part and that is where this course fell down. I only received two instead of the expected three critiques for the sanding and final critique assignments.,4
105155,I enjoyed the time spent on the specialization and felt that the lesson exercises provided some use towards helping students develop their understanding of the craft. My only real criticism about the specialization is that I feel the curriculum could be a little more intensive. Keeping most assignments limited to a 500 word maximum is very constricting. I wish there were more meatier assignments to tackle building up to the capstone.,4
105162,"The only reason this excellent course does not have five stars is because of the technical issues that are the responsibility of Coursera and the failure of some of the peers to write peer reviews according to the instructions. I heartily recommend this course to anyone seeking to kick start, revive, or tune up serious writing.",4
105166,"This course is good, but I want English or Korean subtitles.",4
105167,GREAT SIR..I LEARN IT SO PERFECTLY,4
105168,The course was good!,4
105183,It was a great course and I`ve learned a lot with him!I recommend for all student who want to get start on game design area.,4
105189,"I feel that the course was great but I felt confused on the last assignment, we covered a lot of things during the last week but then I was unsure if I should've applied that on our assignment... Also I'm not sure if it is possible but if we could have a chance to ask the teacher questions would be great. I know that there is a lot of people going this courses and maybe it is not possible but still there are things that I feel only the teacher could answer. Overall the course was good :)",4
105192,"A nice course, but there is lack of teachers participation.",4
105195,"Course materials are a little bit obvious, but I really like the original version of The Shooter and Jane's personality",4
105199,Enjoyable content and presentation but the coarse seemed very short compared to others I've taken. Not a criticism but rather and observation. If it was short on purpose that is one thing but I believe there is more to be said on this topic fundamentally and hope to see this course expanded or a second one produced.I would like to that those involved int its creation.,4
105200,"The course is fun, but as the previous part of the specialization a bit simple for what it charges for the certificate.",4
105204,Makes you think. Interesting for any developer or anyone intested in narratives as a whole. Really nice exercises and lists too!,4
105207,"I liked the course. To improve, could become more dynamic , but the teacher is to be congratulated .",4
105210,I learned good stuff. i gave four star because there could be more content some parts were written instead of a lecture. But i will recommend this course.,4
105219,This course gives actionable ideas about design characters and story lines.,4
105222,"It's pretty good, but it has some things I perceive to be flaws. First of all, this course is entirely about writing a narrative for a game. It uses the examples of Starcraft 2 and Angry Birds. Neither of those games are particularly known for their narrative, but he uses Starcraft 2 as a more heavy narrative example and Angry Birds as a light narrative example. He goes on to talk about how adding implicit narrative elements help engage the player by exploiting their emotions, etc. etc. I don't find these examples to be particularly engaging - especially the cynical cash-grab that is Angry Birds.",4
105244,"Fun, interesting, good pacing and case studies. Instructor was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and presented material well.",4
105247,"Assignments are good-intended, but I am not sure how helpful they are, as they are really boring and unnecessarily time-consuming. I do not know how could one make them better. In contrast, the videos are really good, they are worth your time even if you know your way around these things.",4
105251,"The contents were comprehensive, and the assignments helped reinforce the theory. By using pre-existing references to other works, they were tighter, which I think is useful to focus on the objectives set for a particular week. Some additional creative freedom would also have been interesting.",4
105252,"I really enjoyed this course, The only thing I would have liked to have learned more about was how to do Game Design Documents and how they are made. I would have liked to have seen more examples as well as how to do these examples as well.Thank you, I learned a lot.Sarah Prewitt",4
105255,Really nice way to know hot to present a Story!,4
105274,Nice and helpful course,4
105277,"The course covers a great deal of content, which is very relevant to day to day business context.However, the course instructors can certainly do a better job on providing clear instructions on Projects and phrasing of Quiz questions. Some of the phrasing of questions/deliverables can be confusing and often requires rigorous deciphering.",4
105285,"This course is great, but I would NOT pay for the specialization.",4
105293,Thoughtful and practical !,4
105296,The final course assignment was not defined precisely enough which led to varying interpretations among graders and reduces grades for all as a result.Otherwise a good intro course for the analytics specialization that focuses on the managerial aspects of data analytics and the communication of results.I wish that links to supplementary reading on the statistics used in the course would be provided.,4
105297,I like Professor Glady's style of minimalism in lectures but stressing the end goal of the analytics. IT was an interestingly presented and fairly engaging course. Assignments could be more difficult to encourage deeper learning of the hands-on analytic crunching.,4
105302,"Great course on topic of strategic business analytics. However, it would have been better if there were more readings and examples shown to understand the concepts better.",4
105305,Great course. well presented,4
105309,They do it easy,4
105312,"Good foundations course, some basic working knowledge of R is required so i would recommend that you are able to use the software. Statistical basics is also important to grasp the work.",4
105314,good course. Can focus more on practical aspects,4
105315,I thnik the course is very interested and very good organized and you learn some interesting things.Prior exposure with R is neccesary and in my opinion if in the assignements existed some more questions in order to spent more time in R the course would have been even better..,4
105316,"A good course, its just a little bit too short based on the content it wants us to focus. The chapter on presenting our information is funny because the slides presented contain every anti-pattern that they want us to avoid. Apart from that, a great course.",4
105319,"Interesting and industry-insightful curriculum, contains some detail technicality like use of R programming language but provides hands-on video guidance to help student catch on the technicality.",4
105322,The only problem was the lack of Portuguese/English subtitles.,4
105333,"This course is essential for executives without accounting or law as proficiencies in their portfolios. Taking this ""Three Pillar Model for Business Decisions: Strategy, Law & Ethics,"" prepare a manager to go about the business delivery with all those conceptual tools he needs to get his job done, running the business. As an IT and Music Analytics business person, I find this Coursera and Michigan University course offering essentially to making proper decisions. Problem I find though an excellent course is that the book: “ Three Pillar Models for Business Decisions: Strategy, Law & Ethics,” carries no INDEX that would help to pass the final exam quickly as time and effort is most important for us busy bodies. I could design a watch from this “Three Pillars . . . ,” course.",4
105337,Extremely informative course though the English subtitles for certain lectures were a bit confusing and the large number of peer-graded assignments were tedious to complete.,4
105349,Explanations are not always transparent.,4
105352,Good intro,4
105355,Not bad for introduction in Machine Learning,4
105357,"Too complex lectures for novices, too easy assignments for experienced python programmers.",4
105360,Thank you for this course. It helps me learn a lot of interesting about Data Science.,4
105362,"difficult for beginnersthe authors don't explain many necessary thingsit is useful only for students with the basic knowledge (math, physics)",4
105363,Some problems with tasks.,4
105367,This course is the best for people who are interested in pursuing or continuing their tertiary education in Japan. I highly recommend to people who suited above seek to join this course as the course will give you a better understanding on Japanese university structure.,4
105368,"I find this course really helpfull, as it provides many resources. Also, it made me start planning ahead for my studies in Japan, which is essential. Also, I think having the advices of people that's living there in Japan, and had to go through the same process you will have to go was great. However, I expected the course to be a little more specific when explaining the process you have to follow to study in Japan, but I understand that it changes from one university to another one.",4
105378,The materials are good. The forum is less active.,4
105380,fun and interesting,4
105387,"This course offered a lot of different information to many other students looking abroad. It gave a lot of different scenarios and ways to deal with them. Also it offered many different experiences students in Japan were having, and that was very helpful. However the way it presented the course work information was a little hard to work with on my computer",4
105399,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I think I must have virtually done it on my own as there were no other interventions, certainly in recent weeks. A very thought provoking course and all credit to the Professor and those who helped him put the course together.",4
105402,"I loved the elaborate structure, but they should provide a certificate",4
105403,"I appreciated the professor's clear and articulate lectures, together with the use of in-lecture questions to reinforce the main concepts.I may not completely agree with all of the points raised by the good professor, but the perspective he offered on historical events was greatly appreciated.I also appreciated that approaching the methods of war within different cultures would have required a much larger and longer course and so I am grateful to the professor for placing his focus where he did.It is unfortunate that my timing in participating in this class reduced my ability to properly interact with other students during the progress of the lessons, but I have to accept responsibility for that aspect.Still, I consider this to be one of the more exceptional courses offered by Coursera and credit that largely to the presentation skills of the good professor. I thank him for sharing his knowledge and this opportunity to consider a topic I would not ordinarily study in such detail.",4
105408,A different perspective of war that made me think very differently about the whole process and the reactions of people involved in any form of confrontational situation,4
105410,Good coverage and interesting lectures that provides a good history of all the warfare and on the social psychology. A fresh perspective I guess.,4
105423,Solid presentation of ideas that SHOULD be considered before entering a war -- but sadly are usually ignored in the emotions of a mindless mass moment.,4
105424,"Very well done. However, I disliked how the course itself and even the professor glorified positive aspects of war.",4
105425,A good course and very interesting perspectives. A pity Princeton does not issue certificates.,4
105430,"Although long-winded, it is a fantastic course w/fantastic insights!",4
105431,"Great Course, explores the war in its different facets.",4
105432,"A fresh perspective to see the relation between wars and our societies. The notion that wars are always bad and to be avoided is challenged, and seemingly controversial idea of wars bringing benefit to the societies (at a cost) is discussed, quite convincingly.",4
105434,I did enjoining this program. Many thanks.,4
105439,"Specified subject and well explained view on WAR. Was also able to understand what are the other factors that for war. Being a Research and explorer this was one of the best learning that I had in 2015.Thank you so much,",4
105452,"Good course, with a lot of information.",4
105453,"The passion of Prof. Centeno is contaminating, some of the issues pointed were somewhat new (I have a circle of friends from military profession) and definitely the connection of cultural basis of the society and its capacity to, and way of, fight a war is something that will change my way to see the results of these events in the future.Thank you very much for this initiative.",4
105456,really introductal course ive utilized.thank you.,4
105458,I love the idea of a sociological view of war.,4
105460,"Very interesting course. The first few weeks are little beat boring, discussing some features that are obvious, but as the course continues the questions become more untresting, especially those which concern war with politics. As a whole it is a very good course, which gives the student a broad understandung of the issue. recommended!!",4
105461,Good information. Good discussion forum. Recommended.,4
105463,"An extremely interesting course, full of fascinating sociologycal and historical topics!The only thing that wasn't that good about it was the difficulty to get some of books the instructor mentioned.",4
105491,"It is hard to take a cousre for foreigner who live abroad, but this web site & lecture gave opportunity for everone including me . It will be very helpful to anyone who have interest in Entrepreneursip",4
105492,"This course in the specialization was really helpful to me in shaping my service prototype by applying ""the wizard of oz"" move....... Thank you so much coursera and Wharton",4
105496,Very good content and expert teachers. Overall a very good experience. I expected more articulated assessment though.,4
105510,a wonderful opportunity to learn basics of entrepreneurship and The first very course is so helpful in starting the startup works. I recommend every one who want to see the change around and want to be the change should enrol for this course. I thank wharton for such a sublime initiative.,4
105512,Great introduction to entrepreneurship from 4-5 very talented professors who don't have just theoretical experience but actual experience as entrepreneurs.,4
105516,"This is an incredible starting point.The main theme of the course is dealing with the intrinsic uncertainty ingrained in all entrepreneurial ventures. If you don't know how to reduce this uncertainty, you may never make it out of the developmental phases, much less procure capital investments.This course certainly doesn't cover everything but it opens the door to what you really need to focus on. Hearing the language and the terminology is incredibly beneficial.",4
105519,Very good overview of how to go about analysing ones idees before going for them.,4
105527,"Loved it, I gave me a lot to think about and consider.",4
105528,It's a very helpful course as introduction to entrepreneurship world. It's very rich by knowledge about how take the risk to identify and utilize opportunities and get in the marketplace.,4
105545,I found this course helpful and gave me basic ideas to brainstorm on a project which at the initial phase on finding out the right opportunity.,4
105550,Truly inspirational course with real life examples. Those who are seriously considering to become an entrepreneur MUST take this course.4 stars as there is very little to do for a person who is taking this course.,4
105551,"Excellent content, in-depth compared to may other MOOCs. The instructors have organized the lectures very well and shown some useful and practical methods that can be implemented at various stages.",4
105554,"As it's the start of the whole specialisation it's not very clearly detailed. Like few lectures are amazing as solo lectures, but overall week wise all lectures do not connect so well.",4
105568,Invaluable information in every lecture.,4
105575,"Great content, And the faculty is up to the mark",4
105581,Some of the lecturers have insightful examples that help you as you take this course. Very informative for short video classes.,4
105583,"I felt the first week offered almost no valuable information, and when purchasing a specialization, I expect every week to be full of facts. After that it picked up and I became satisfied. I would purchase it again.",4
105586,This was a great course. It gave an amazing overview of the Business Idea and Opportunity. It allowed me to understand the overall process. I now know how to choose what business idea to develop and also what steps there are in launch. I learned some things here that I never knew about prototypes and how to test a service business. I do wish there were more of a focus on the Service Sector. Many people these days are creating businesses in that sector and it would help me to have a better understanding on those topics.,4
105588,Totally recommended and a good start for the series. Also very motivational.,4
105593,Great course!!,4
105597,Thank you for this course! Looks like basic training for entrepreneurs.,4
105598,"Scholarship for further modules, please.",4
105602,"Very useful combination of stats, tips and advise",4
105606,"This course provides a broad overview of the entrepreneurial process and comes complete with plenty of actionable material. It lacks any sort of meaningful collaboration with other students, which seems to be an inherent flaw of the MOOC platform more than a fault of this course. I will be taking the rest of the specialization, and hope the capstone can bring like minded students together to turn the theory we learn throughout this course series into reality.",4
105607,"Good course.I did find the quizes not as challenging as the Marketing and Accounting courses I took through Wharton/ Coursera. Sometimes it seems some of the Professors talk very quickly as opposed to the Core MBA offerings. Overall, great content. Thank you!",4
105609,Embedded one page case study in the middle of the lecture videos with a followup debrief or the same during the assignments would be extremely useful.,4
105623,"Overall, a good course. Slow at first. The class first had me concerned if I was going to learn anything new, but toward middle way, the relevancy really picked up. I am very curious to see what the Wharton School team of professors have to share in the next class.",4
105630,Prof Hsu is not enthusiastic / gripping in presentations and so the material he teaches doesnt stick.,4
105633,"Overall, this was an excellent course and, for the beginner, a great foray into general entrepreneurship concepts and ideas. Here's why I say that:1) The professors offering the course are apparently top-notch - they all have extensive and varied experiences with entrepreneurship, and many of them have published research and reports that can be found with a quick google search.2) The amount and nature of the content make it so that it's easy to approach the course more like a workshop, than some static didactic. For example, one of Ethan Mollick's talks comes with a spreadsheet to help students think a little more concretely and specifically about their ventures.3) The course passed no judgement on push vs. pull ventures; they really tried to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each. With the business community's surge in interest in design-thinking, I had been under the false impression that a push venture, by definition, was inferior.I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, however, because I feel that more attention could have been devoted to more service-oriented or product and service hybrid businesses (though the professors didn't totally ignore the service-oriented business). Also, I was under the impression that the professors would have some degree of real-time interaction with students (although I get that they are super busy), or that even if the professors themselves couldn't respond, that a teacher's assistant or representative would comment on questions raised about the course content.Again, this is overall a fantastic course, though not perfect - I would still highly recommend it to anyone thinking about entrepreneurship!",4
105638,Overall good course. The slides should've been presented in only one document per module - like almost all previous courses of Wharton. All of the optional videos with interviews had audio problems (I could only hear them from the left speaker).,4
105646,"Very good, but after all the hard work one should be able to pursue a paid certificate at least",4
105647,A very interesting introduction to Sustainable Development and a nice journey led by professor Jeffrey Sachs,4
105653,I'm so happy to have passed through this course. It has exposed me to the real facts about Humanity on earth and what needs to be done to keep us here long enough. Thanks to Professor Jeffrey Sachs and all members of the course team,4
105658,"I'm a plan and policy analyst. I got a lot of idea for policy planing by SDGs guideline and some indicator that make the following process more clearly. But a few link for quiz have not working, please update.",4
105667,Slightly outdated.,4
105671,"Great information and Dr. Sachs is very easy to listen to. Strange that the quizzes test skills that are not covered in the lectures, and reference material on the quiz is very cumbersome on mobile devices. Still, very educational and worthwhile overall.",4
105682,Beautiful learning tools,4
105688,"Professor Sachs is preaching to the choir with this course, and such a ponderous emphasis on the seriousness of the dangers of ""business as usual"" is unnecessary. The lectures are much longer than they need to be. Otherwise, this course is very valuable.",4
105691,Thank you all very much for your efforts. Very informative course.,4
105695,Interesting and important topics discussed during this course - definitely worth it!,4
105706,Very informative and interesting. The links to various sources in the tests are not up to date though and make it difficult to get a 100% score.,4
105714,"Prof Sachs takes us through a very interesting and engaging course on the need for sustainable development. It is simple in most parts. While I enjoyed the number crunching questions in the quiz, I can imagine that it is not for everyone. It is extremely informative, and I have filled up a notebook with my notes from all of the 15 lectures.Just taking a star away for some of the links or course material not being updated. For instance the links to external websites are not valid any more. Also, the actual SDG's are different from the ones in the lecture, as the ones in the lecture were proposed as against the current actual ones.",4
105715,"This course has been deeply informative. The instructor is outstanding, sharing his deep experience and knowledge of economics, geography, international development, and earth science through the lectures. The time commitment required for this course is minimal considering the immense treasure of learning it represents. My only issues with this course (hence 4 stars instead of 5) are: 1. no one is monitoring the course, so questions/comments are only answered by other students; and 2. there is no certificate. Thank you Coursera and Dr. Sachs for this fantastic course!",4
105717,"Wonderful content and exposure to world data sources. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars were some of the errors in quizzes scoring quesitons incorrectly--but overall, this was not a hinderance to learning and getting something out of the class.",4
105723,"This course gave an excellent overview of Sustainability. What that entails and why it is crucial to develop and push toward global goals (SDGs) in this ""Anthropocene"" we find ourselves in today. The text gives a good look at all concepts related to Sustainability and resources to find more data and information for each heading. Professor Sachs' lectures were great and as were the tools used and recommended readings. There were some errors and discrepancies in the quizzes, but aside from that I would highly recommend this course.",4
105727,Very good course! The only thing that i must criticise is that in many weekly tests there are mistakes. This can get a little bit frustrating,4
105729,I've really enjoyed this course and I enjoyed following the lectures. I feel a need to do something real a sustainable world.,4
105735,Very very interesting but videos are too long...,4
105738,Great course. Loved it.,4
105740,"An excellent course, especially for those looking for a career in international development.",4
105744,It was really tasking and demanding for me but i enjoyed every bit of Professor's lecture. He provided detailed insights into every aspect of sustainable development needed for every government of every country.,4
105751,A lot of references that helps to understand the complex situation of sustainable development.,4
105756,Great course! Significant issues covered and well presented. Data errors in the quizzes make it less charming however.,4
105786,very complete and interesting,4
105788,Nice course. I learnt so much but I am disappointed there's no certificate after all.,4
105790,"Extremely well done videos, Professor Sachs is articulate and clear. The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment.The quiz are not easy, one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5. However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it's a good learning process. It never fails to amaze me how much data we have collected globally and for so long!",4
105813,Very Interesting and helpful. It's a way to open our mind and definitely something that everyone should know about before it is too late.,4
105821,"Highly pertinent subject matter. Material was slightly repetitive. Overall, highly recommended.",4
105827,Excellent introduction to the basic concepts and background data about sustainable development.,4
105834,"I really enjoyed how expert Professor Sachs is on sustainable development. He seems to know a lot about the subject and we can see a spark on his eyes when he is teaching. Moreover, the lectures and quizzes are comprehensive and well organized.However, apart from the last Week, I think that solutions for the many problems that Professor Sachs presents are not showed properly. Although there are many issues unsolved, there may be a lot of good examples throughout the world to be presented together with these issues.Kind Regards,Rodolfo",4
105835,A great overview of a very complicated topic. Dr. Sachs does a great job presenting the information in easily digestible bits but still keeps it interesting.,4
105838,A great introduction to the subject of Sustainable Development!Prof. Sachs talks very slowly which makes it very easy to follow and understand. I personally liked to watch the videos at a higher speed though.,4
105840,"the course is of immens use for the whole world as the globlisation in all spears of human activitieshas taken place . People and many small governments are unaware of the impact of the development in different spears of its state activities such as economics, social and environment etc. This course with its solutions and applications for , will help the human habitations on this Earth will make living worth for every one The Paris Aggriment is really a triumph for the human race on this earth, this course will definatly will make us understand the shared objectives to end poverty, establish peace and ensure a life of dinity and opportunity for all.",4
105842,Very enlightening course thus far. The format is perfect,4
105844,"This course proves to be very informative, and the quizzes push to discover new sources for course material. However, it is highly focused on the programs set by the UN and could provide more solutions and feedbacks on what is being done. Very much oriented toward public policies. Good experience overall.",4
105862,"Lots of quality conversational information on sustainable development, but I wish there were more interactive projects to apply the concepts. Without an application, much of the information remained abstract and hard to remember.",4
105863,"Very interesting and demanding course, however is very long (14 weeks) in comparison to other online courses and due to its length it should provide a certificate of completion.",4
105868,"Excellent course! 4 stars though, instead of 5, for the lack of minimum certification.",4
105887,It is wonderful course. Whey the Columbia University offer a certificate it will be a Five star course.,4
105890,Love it. Proff Sachs did not put me to sleep and that is a good thing!! Made me eager to learn.,4
105893,"I really enjoyed this course. Very fluid, well organized and well-present.In my opinion, quizzes should not contain questions referring to the book, because not everyone (like me) can afford buying it.I would enjoy if Prof. Sachs could go deeper in the topics and explore them a little bit more and make student´s job a little bit more difficult.",4
105896,"It's a very interesting and fun course. I think maybe it's too long for not giving a certificate, but it's a nice course to follow and to learn by even if you just do 10 minutes per day and take it as a personal experience",4
105902,"The content is good. The delivery of lectures can be more engaging, with aid of visuals to illustrate and emphasize important concepts.",4
105908,Its very important to know what sustainable development is and knowing it makes a change in society.,4
105913,Very interesting and well delivered content. Occasional links expired,4
105914,"The course covers various topics about sustainability from different perspectives beginning from what is sustainability, who and what get impacted, what is being done and what can be done to ensure sustainable economic development and various other aspects.I highly recommend this course to every one, for a well encapsulated curriculum and for great awareness.",4
105919,Too many weeks - it's the biggest problem for me,4
105920,This course is pretty much what i expected from an online course. I just rate it with four stars because:1. Quiz questions are often just about interpreting world bank data and not about the contents of the course.2. Having read Prof. Sachs book the course does not offer additional insights.,4
105925,"In this course there is a lot of valuable information, well prepared lessons and readings. I would try to make quizzes more complicated.",4
105942,Useful for business risk analysis and modeling complex problem.,4
105944,"It was an interesting insight. Especially for beginners I would recommend it. Is also suits the previous courses well (Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling and Introduction to Spreadsheets and Models). I study finance and economics, so it was a bit too basic though. The Excel features are nice though and something that you would use yourself so easy.",4
105947,Great course and with lots of techniques for modeling in Excel,4
105949,Well taught. The material and exams were challenging but well aligned. Best to playback at 1.25-1.5 though.,4
105951,Very Knowledgeable content and easy to understand.,4
105954,"Nice course, probably the best so far in this specialization. I really enjoyed Sergei Savin's lectures - they were simple & clear. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Senthil Veeraraghavan's lectures -he tried to explain an introductory 2-3 months statistics course in just one hour-absolute failure. I definitely recommend the course but I would like to see some improvements in the future sessions with more examples on excel instead of reading mathematical formulas from ppt files.",4
105961,Please allow Prof. Sergey to take this course. Week 3 was crap because the instructor gave no real-world examples to push home the concepts he was propagating and his english is really hard to comprehend as well.,4
105962,THANK YOU!,4
105963,Professor Senthil ruined Week 3 with no explanation and reading exactly the same story from the slides. Rest course is interesting and engaging. Thanks.,4
105965,Nice course. But's it's a bit too simple.,4
105966,"This was a great course; very good explanations teoretical and practice, you gave us powerful tools to analyze data and took the necesary time for cover the topics. Maybe you can add in the future some exercises that we have to upload for review among each other students. Thank you very much for share this tools and your knowledge.",4
105971,Too easy....,4
105974,"Good, but gives the very basics.",4
105978,4.5 stars actually. Good overview of modeling risk.,4
105988,Great content! My only suggestion would be a more in-depth course over a 2 or 3 month period (with the price adjusted accordingly).,4
105997,"Some good sections of the course, but others are not explained well at all. Overall valuable material",4
105999,This is very meaningful.,4
106001,The English translation into simple Chinese is not very good. I missed the meaning of words or sentences from simple Chinese.,4
106004,Introducing a whole picture of marketing and its basics. Easy to understand and catch up.,4
106008,Great view of managing employees from a human perspective.,4
106017,"Very Good Course, but 3rd lesson was incomplete and the missing section was not addressed by coursera.",4
106033,"This is what science learning is about, a 'thing' as light we take for granted explained and parasitized in accessible well structured way. Talk about it, wonder about it and especially...Do it. I gave it a 4 star rating, five would be perfect, w've learned that nothing is perfect and can be improved... maybe this is.",4
106034,"I love the activities! The results from these experiments are wild. I would have liked a section of this course for lecture, since I enrolled for knowledge not only activities and strategies, but observing these activities was simply amazing.",4
106041,"It is not five stars for just one reason: it think it could be better if having not so long video. Please, professor Amar split the 22minutes/31minutes videos in small portions.Notwithstanding, it was amazing and inspiring to know how democratic the American Constitution creation process was. Unfortunately, because the socialism and communism influence in our country we do not have much information about everything which have to do with American history and culture.You American people would be proud their history and take care to things go on at the same way.",4
106043,"excellent review of the content, intentions, and context behind the language of the Constitution, including the amendments. I really enjoyed it.",4
106053,im beginning to like this course the professor is very good at making the study of the constitution lively,4
106061,This course was a great introduction to the United States Constitution. The material was given sufficient lecture time to allow you to grasp the information and it was not rushed through.,4
106067,Got started late but has been very informative with lots of surprises I thought I knew more than I did.,4
106070,Very useful information and resourceful for on-line teaching.,4
106074,I thoroughly enjoyed the course as it helped put a lot of learning (that I have had on the job) in proper perspective. I specifically enjoyed the off platform activities.,4
106076,"Some great material, and really valuable insights to the skill of teaching on line. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in on line teaching.",4
106084,"There is nothing revolutionary in this course about teaching online, however, I do believe that it teaches the fundamentals well. If you are new to online teaching or perhaps would like to tune up your skills and make sure that what you are doing is best practice then this course is for you.",4
106114,Amazing and very useful course...Thanks,4
106117,Very nice and interesting course.,4
106121,A very good class for English language teachers,4
106132,Nice course focusing on the essentials in work place.,4
106137,"Very common part which we normally miss up have been carry out for review and study which can truly enhance the skill for management, however some of the part seem to be remain just theoretical and hardly bring out for practice base on my personally view as senior executive.Clear lecture presenting do career coach especially for fresh graduate.Slide show given for clear view and note make are great for study.Overall this course came in with great presentation and crystal clear information given.",4
106138,略overwhelming,4
106162,"There was more work put into this Capstone Project, but each assignment had a purpose and was thoroughly explained, modeled and ready for you, as the student, to create. Great way to grow and learn by teaching and doing!",4
106174,Great it was,4
106196,"I really like the course, there are many interesting things to improve our teaching practice. However I have found that it is not really easy to do it in the classroom.",4
106227,"please be nice to Chinese mainland students, the net probelm, just like we can't use google in China, but we need to upload some assginments on it.",4
106228,"the timing was a problem, with part 2 starting before the planned end of part 1",4
106240,I have learned lots of Chinese tradition.,4
106242,"Very good course. By a stroke of luck, before taking this course, I took another course on 中华传统文化 which was a wonderful refresher for what I grew up with in my formative years.I am particularly hopeful that with an integrative holistic approach of Western and Eastern medical disciplines, people can learn to prevent getting sick, work with doctors to heal themselves with minimium side effects when they fall ill.It is very interesting to note that thousands of years ago, Chinese believe that people can live to 120!",4
106244,Interesting topics that provide participants opportunities to reflect on the way they teach and how they can make their students the center of a class.,4
106250,The African perspective was very interesting.,4
106251,During the lectures not all the slides were well revised and the peer assessments should include more specific guides.,4
106262,"Very well structured, I as a vocational training school teacher miss examples for 17 to 22 year old students.",4
106264,"As a course on Web 2.0 Tools, I would suggest that the course also uses web 2.0 tools to engage the participants. It will give us hands on experience as a learner on how the tools can engage us.",4
106267,Great course to learn about the various web tools for different purposes.,4
106268,Thank you for introducing me to so much Web 2.0 Tools.,4
106270,The course's online learning platform was convenient and easy to follow. The pace that the course goes at was ideal and the allowance to go ahead with later week's assignments was a good move - as it catered to my availability so i could finish the later week's assignment before i get busier with work and studies in the later part of the month.,4
106271,Free Tools for Interactive Classroom Learning,4
106272,The content is really good but the course has too much theory. Mixing it with some practical programming assignments would have been very nice,4
106275,Very theoretical but very good. Well presented.,4
106277,Very good course thank youI wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as RThanks a lot again !,4
106278,This is a very good course. I think it provides a very good foundation of text mining and analytics like PLSA and LDA. More advanced research discussed in the last lecture is also very interesting.,4
106290,"the course is very helpful in giving the overall flavor of text mining and analytics. I would recommend to reduce the number of math work and focus on the conceptual level along with more application that could be used. For the math part, adding optional videos for more details about math will be very useful and helpful",4
106293,"This is an excellent course that captures many different text mining techniques. It requires some math knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts.I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course:1) Lack of examples along the formulas and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them.2) The optional programming exercises are easy to complete, but the environment is very confusing to set it up.",4
106296,Good survey of techniques,4
106301,"Very detailed, but taught in an easily understandable manner.",4
106307,It's pretty good to take this course and get more idea and point of view for the management in arts and cultural organization. Many people love art but still believe paying for art is extravagant. However there are plenty people around the world enjoying art and know how to manage it for life.,4
106308,"Interesting and useful, but I doubt the certificate is worth it. Definitely audit it, though.",4
106313,"This was the most helpful online course that I have ever participated in and I'd like to say that I'm honored and really happy about the new theory, which I have learned throughout the lessons.I really like the fact that you don't have peer assessed assignments, because I find them very time consuming and not helpful. Also every lesson was really well structured and easy to understand. The fact that almost each of them was shot during a real class is another plus for me, because when I have attended other courses most of the tutors just read and you can see their eyes moving while they are doing it and it really destroys my concentration.Something which I would like was to have more part of the book maybe. If you are afraid that a student might afterwards upload it in some torrent site you can build some platform where one wouldn't be able to download but only to read a certain document. I would have liked to receive the whole book like that and more written files.",4
106360,"Overall good course, although at times narrow understanding of right answers.",4
106361,"Perfect course. I learned lot of stuff and really enjoyed it. I am only giving 4 stars because as a non-paying student I could not benefit from the graded assignments. As person who would never use the knowledge professionally (working in IT), I did not want to pay for the certificate.",4
106362,I'd like to be able to take a free version of the quizzes.,4
106368,Tough to pass. Great scientific info. Instructor born to teach.,4
106372,"Really interesting, nicely presented.",4
106380,"Very interesting course, kept me involved and was very interactive.",4
106405,Great course really explain in a real way how can i save a lot of time for important projects. Thanks.,4
106407,Good course,4
106409,A great course,4
106416,"It´s ok, but could be better.",4
106418,Is good but I am thinking that the course could be better with more information and techniques. Thanks and congratulations!!,4
106419,"I recommend this course, helps us to better manage our time in work and personal life.",4
106421,It`s great!,4
106428,The additional links and research material were really interesting and insightful.,4
106431,"This was a great course. Well structured into the four areas you need to understand to build transmedia experiences. Loved the mix of industry stories with lectures.My biggest bug bear is that ALL of the content is delivered via video. The transcripts are there, but they don't read well on their own. I would really love an eBook to go with this course for future reference.",4
106436,"Generally, a good course.The lectures and supporting talks were instructive, helpful, and inspiring. The instructors and industry experts were well chosen.The assignments were pretty good. They provided nice constraints and freedom of expression to come up with ideas and think about how one might create and adapt a story world so that meaningful experiences can be had from it. The peer review process was good, but I would have liked instructor feedback as well (I suppose it is free for because of only being peer reviewed though).",4
106440,"This course offers a comprehensive introduction to transmedia studies and practices. The framework of the course is well structured and it's easy to follow. The resources are fantastic with lots of advice and content provided by industry professionals. If you've heard of transmedia, but don't know what it is or how it's going to change storytelling in the future, take this course and find out.",4
106446,good course I've ever learnt through video and exercises,4
106447,It covers lots of common mistakes for English learners. Wish there was similar class at advanced level.,4
106455,Excellent learning platform.,4
106458,"This course was very helpful. I was not aware of several mistakes that I usually make before taking this course. I feel more confident after learning new tips and being able to identify the areas that I must improve. Taking in consideration that grammar covers a lot of topics, the professors were able to summarize the most important topics and to make the classes interactive.",4
106464,nice lecture it is!,4
106471,"This was so useful, but sometimes difficult for me.",4
106484,thank you,4
106492,This course is very useful. There are so many notes that we don't pay more attention to. I recommend studying every single word carefully.,4
106494,The course is really great and approaches the most common English mistakes. However I believe the approach could be more adult.,4
106499,"As a graphic and motion designer it gave insights on many concepts, terminolgies, and consideration I haven't known before.",4
106505,Good basic course,4
106507,"Thanks for all, is a great course, thanks Coursera and thanks for each opportunity.",4
106522,Content is really good and I learned concepts really well because its well structure. Videos can become better. I recommend this course to every UI enthusiast.,4
106527,The course content is adequate enough to justify the course title.The best part is the assignments and the peer reviews. Reviewing the peers' work is gave me more insights into the subject. And getting reviewed by peers made me correct my self.Bad parts: Few of the videos are presented in a manner that the presenter was reading notes by looking at a screen and without any expressions. This was defeating the purpose of video tutorial. The basic expectation of a video tutorial over a text reading is that the presenter could put some expression and interactivity.,4
106531,"Generally fascinating, but with some issues with transcription of lectures and clarity of questions.",4
106533,It's a very good beginners class. The lectures are quite thorough and well-suited to those who are auditing the class.,4
106536,I think it is best for the lecturer to speak Korean and have subtitles.,4
106539,"Great course! The professor is unstructured, and has the tendency to ramble in the lecture, but thoroughly enjoyed the course.",4
106547,Excellent course in understanding the American legal system,4
106558,"I thought the course was very interesting and the videos were great. One criticism I have, though, is that the name of the course is misleading; it really should have been called Educational Reform in the US. I don't think we studied specifically urban issues at all.",4
106565,"A great introduction to business strategy tools (which gets exponentially more complex when you apply them in the follow-on course!). I really appreciated the deep but approachable theoretical discussions of economic rents, and the professor's serious efforts to bring together business and economic principles. As a former student of economics, it gave me a great anchor point in the course.While I really appreciate the case-based method, the volume of students just isn't high enough to allow for much vigorous discussion on the forums (or wasn't for me). I would highly recommend taking the course with a friend or colleague and setting aside time to connect each week to get the most out of the case discussions.",4
106568,Case study was superb!!!,4
106573,"In this short course, you can learn few important key topics of business strategy. During the session there are several real cases discussed for understanding better the lesson, but several doubts remains theory. The end-of-session case studies are too complex for using the theories learned. Too many questions were not solved... but it is ""Foundation of...""",4
106577,"The peer review has some issues, but overall the course is great.",4
106580,It is challenging in part to take this course but its worth it. thank you,4
106596,"Great material, love the phasing and reminders, the professors are easy to understand and not boring. If we could have some sort of interaction with the professors and more interactions with classmates, the course would be even better.",4
106601,"I´ve never taken on-line classes, but being this the first time I must say that it is a great method to learn with some flexibility. I would encourage these courses to improve their final assignament grading, as it is the warranty of trusting that any body with a coursera certificate has passed a rigorous evaluation plan.",4
106606,Provides very good understanding on Business strategy,4
106617,A good course for future MBA students especially the ones interested to pursue a MBA degree in Strategy Management,4
106622,THE COURSE CONTAIN CONTENTS THAT ARE PRACTICABLE AND THOROUGHLY RESEARCH. THANK YOU. I HOPE TO APPLY FOR A CERTIFICATE SOON.,4
106623,"Foundations of Business Strategy has greatly expounded my knowledge on business strategy not only as an essential component of a business, but existing primarily as the core of any business.",4
106634,"I found the information very illuminating. I only wish there was more focus on small firms, startups, and evaluating an industry as if the student were looking to enter the industry.",4
106635,Very good Basic strategy management concepts. Will help in clearing some doubts.,4
106643,Amazing learning experience with a distinguished faculty having a lot of knowledge backing their lectures.Thanks,4
106645,This course helped me a lot !,4
106663,"Great course, but they should provide a statement of accomplishment...",4
106664,"Think it was a very good course, a bit high level though. It is ""Foundations"" though, so that is a somewhat unfair criticism.",4
106668,May be there is a technical glitch in answering the Questions of daily assignments while selecting options of the question type 'select all that apply '.,4
106674,very good course.,4
106683,Good course but would have loved two things : more practical examples and certainly more detailed info on multiples.,4
106685,Very engaging instructor plying cogent videos and challenging quizes,4
106690,Thanx a lot,4
106697,Great Job!,4
106700,It is a must for all those who would love to explore vision at the perspective of neuroscience and evolution.,4
106703,"great layout and well presented. concepts were stimulating and I felt I learnt a lot. I would have liked some discussion around topics such as amblyopia and development, effects of observer movement, and the links between visual perception and the vestibular system. Having said that, I think the content was plenty for a 5 week course.",4
106704,"Course was amazing. It deals with how to correctly understand visual illusions through empirical data collection. It does not delve into the anatomical aspects, or the cellular aspects, of vision. Some drawbacks would be the lack of explanation on how to model or collect the data, which is probably too complicated to state in a online course anyway.",4
106711,"Very well researched and articulate professor, incredibly knowledgeable.",4
106724,"This is quite a good course, light on people who are not in HR or Psychology background. It subtly let's you understand a few key factors every manger or supervisor can deploy in their respective work place.",4
106729,Its a great course that gives a lot of good and solid and useful information about the issues at work.,4
106730,Course material is too small. More explanation and examples would be good.,4
106731,Please provide lecture handout pdf so that I can save and download and review.,4
106734,"Some of the pdf reports generators, videos and links don't work, besides that good course.",4
106738,"Great course, I learned the basic of psychology at work and give a good insight of what to correctly do to motivate, have less issues with stress and so on. :)",4
106740,It would have been good to have more case studies in the course as it leads to practical application.,4
106746,"I am a not working guy, so many questions are hard for me to answer. However, the terms described in the course make sense to me and I really leant something form this course.",4
106748,Compact and informative course.Especially the opportunities to evaluate yourself are extremly interesting and help form a bond between the teaching material and yourself.,4
106749,Very informative course. I am interested in psychology and this psychology in work is a very good course for those who work.,4
106772,I found the course to be a very good introduction and review for beginner writers and also experienced writers who just need a refresher of sorts. Comments from peers are the most helpful and motivational aspect of the course.,4
106774,"The course is great! However, there are no written examples of expectations for weeks 4 and 5 At least David Hill shows examples after lectures. Not everyone is an audible learner therefore written examples should be posted for week 5",4
106781,"This course is great so far - really helpful and specific - but I feel like there is an unnecessary amount of repetition of certain points. We were told ""use your own experiences to fuel your stories"" in 2 videos with David Hill, a reading assignment and then again in a video talking to another author. While I appreciate the ""look, they say it too!"" idea of backing up their ideas, I feel like this is overkill.",4
106782,"The course gave me some insight into the processes involved in editing and seeking publication. However, I feel it was too skewed toward writing for VERY young readers, whereas it was marketed as including Young Adult fiction.",4
106784,Great course to learn the basics of writing and to get a broader view on what i means to be an author of children's fiction.,4
106788,"This is the first MOOC I did and it was a great experience. The instructors and guests were pleasant and informative. The assignments were fun to do and the peer reviews were all respectful, most were very constructive.Would recommend!",4
106794,I've learned so much from this course. Not just about the whole writing process but also some valuable information on how to get your work published. Thanks for opening this treasure chest for new writers like me! Cheers!,4
106800,"Loved this course! I just wished there was a better system for peer reviews, because I couldn't get any helpful tips or feedbackthrough them.",4
106801,"I Love this Course. It challenges me to write. It makes me believe I can be a good writer, may be an author.Thank you Commonwealth Education Trust Team.",4
106811,ProGreat introductory creative writing course.ConNeed to create a more structured approach for people when they are giving feedback.,4
106812,I loved it all!,4
106814,I found this course a very inspiring a thoughtful experience. It gives you direction provides you a meaningful path to follow.,4
106816,I had a great time learning . It was fun as well as informative. Maybe we can have a story competition in another of your courses.,4
106818,A very introductory course that helps in getting an idea on how to write for young readers. I found it quite useful.,4
106826,"This course has some very distinct and informative material which was terrific for learning about writing for young readers. I particularly found Maria Gill's modules very informative, encouraging and well presented.What I found REALLY disheartening, was that we as students (who aren't qualified and at times, have questionable English literacy skills), were the ones who were given the task of assessing all of the assessments in this course. I was really hoping for feedback from the industry experienced course creators :( . The other thing that was frustrating is that 'word count' was a criteria. Some students were brutal in their grading because one was over the word count by a few words, so be aware of that, if you are going to undertake this 'course'.This is not so much a course which leads to some sort of exam or qualification (dictionary.cambridge.org) but an independent information acquirement experience.I learnt quite a lot about writing and publishing and would encourage you to do this course, as it does contain some great information and tips, just be aware that grading is based on newbies like us and sometimes the feedback can be a bit disheartening but just persevere and you will learn lots. These people really know what they are talking about.",4
106829,"One of my favorites parts of all the course, was the interview with the playwright. The course is about guiding the participants, or those who want to start to write, with the most important and necessary advices. In addition, the profesor wants to make us understand that writting is more than just a profession: it's passion, and the most effective way of see that point is by hearing a writter who feels that way about litterature active and also pasive.",4
106840,"This course was very nice, its objectives were clear and it gave a good panorama of the writing experience. The interviews with writers were interesting and some tips about editing and publishing were really valuable.",4
106845,Very simplistic in places and preaches their style as if it is the only way sometimes too. However it's a good grounding in the basics and there are some useful exercises.,4
106854,"I did the MOOC just to break the ice and have a general idea about this world of writing for young audiences. I think the course is fair and quite complete, has some very interesting insights, and the videos as very informative and the perfect lenght (by the time your head can't take more info, they are over). Thank you very much, it has been a pleasure.",4
106859,"This is a great course to get you writing. The interviews with writers are particularly helpful. The assignments are well thought out though there was some confusion when it came to peer reviews and how to assess word count which the staff are trying to sort out. Peer reviews were very varied as some people just wrote one word down which was no help at all, while someone inexperienced wil struggle with this I think the course should include an early module on reading and critically as reviewing someone's work is a great aid to writing and editing your own work. Course paperwork could include a critical checklist to help with peer reviews. I would have found that helpful so that I could be confident Of doing a good job. I think you should also be able to edit your reviews as a mistake will mean your fellow writer could be marked down. All in all though well worth doing. Many Thanks to the tutors, staff and guest writers.",4
106874,"A great tool for beginner writes, but not very good at showing you how to write SPECIFICALLY for children.",4
106875,The instructors are great and the interviews are very useful. I would have liked to learn about tone and pacing of the stories. Is there a common structure (at least a basic one that we can later break?). Hollywood uses the three-act structure. Is this also useful for stories for young readers?I learned a lot but perhaps there should be a second course. I'd be interested.,4
106879,"I am loving this course and it feels liberating to write again, after so many months of idleness.",4
106881,I learned some helpful tips on how to edit and how to better structure a story. But there were assignments particularly on the last two that should have used assignment two or three.,4
106883,"Great introductory course for writing for children. Comprehensive topic coverage, however not too much detail.",4
106885,Wonderful to see and hear so many different authors giving advice and being able to learn from them. The instructors were well spoken and neatly organized or an online audience. Definitely a treat for the unpublished and aspiring authors. New tips for old dogs and pups. You can have others review your writing style and format. The only problems you may run into might be the students submitting for review.,4
106889,"Great, this course upgraded my view.",4
106899,"Overall an enjoyable course. I do find that the evaluation rubrics provided were a little bit unsatisfactory. In addition to improved rubrics, clearer instructions on how to use the rubrics would have been helpful.",4
106900,A pretty basic but very enjoyable and thorough course in writing for younger readers. I really enjoyed my time on this course.,4
106902,"Basic course for budding writers.Good practice.Also, excellent interviews with other published writers, editors and playwrights. It was the highlight of the course for me.",4
106905,"This is a really nice course, it has actually help me grow in the way i write a story! There are many things i am taking away, key tips and suggestions. One thig that could be improved in this course was the assesment, noone has assesed my work becase of which my course it said to be incomplete. That could change, otherwise AWSOME!!!!",4
106907,I'm learning to write a book which is great.,4
106916,"This course is really meant for beginning writers for Young Readers. The information is good and at a pace that is easy to follow. If you are an advanced writer or have experience, it may not be as valuable for you. However, if you are just starting to look at becoming a professional, or have limited experience beyond writing for yourself, you will find this a very valuable learning experience.",4
106919,Many more Handouts to refer can improve the course much better,4
106924,I love this course. I learned a lot. It ignited my passion for writing again.,4
106933,"The general advice given is very good and useful, and the section",4
106935,The course is helpful for begining writers. Thank you.,4
106936,interesting and clear !For all levels of EnglishGood experience,4
106942,Very good Training! Lots of examples and practical knowledge.,4
106943,"This was a very helpful course, as well as entertaining.",4
106944,Great class!,4
106945,Very intetesting and complete. Would love a follow up. Didn't give 5 stars just because I think the course could have been even more specific about young readers target audience. Thank you.,4
106947,It's perfect for teach beginning Children's book writers how to start writing,4
106959,It was good tips. it has really interesting interviews. It was been really positive experience and encouraging to keep writing.,4
106970,"An excellent course. The inclusion of excerpts allows one to develop a greater understanding of the different topics dealt in the MOOC. Also, several excerpts are from stories written by authors based in different continents; this makes reading the excerpts all the more interesting. Also, the course allows one to adjust the deadlines for submitting assignments, which is a good thing.",4
106984,"Very good course and Prof specialy guest Prof ,now really i have a tools to write story for children and teenager(my dream) ,i hope that i will succeed in my new experience.Thanks for all.",4
106987,"Great if you literally know nothing about writing but want to write. Otherwise, the first three modules cover basic story writing information. What's great is the interviews with authors and the ability to peer review and so, read all sorts of things.",4
107000,Great course for all coaches of youth sports,4
107001,"The course is very valuable and I would recommend this course to anyone involved in sports. My interest was mainly as an athlete but also as a parent of two very young children. The insights gained for children's training were actually very valuable as I am now more confident and comfortable to allow the child to develop their sport skills through early sampling. The aim in this case is to support and instil in the minds of the children the benefits of being active and later on, if they wish to do so, enter a more specialised athletic path. My comment with regards to how the course is run is that I would have preferred if it was a bit more interactive. With 4 moderators I expected that the questions posed on the forum would have been answered but this was mainly not the case. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course.",4
107013,Trendy topic with talks from expertises in the field. Covered all areas of interest. Congrats!,4
107016,"very broad perspective, up to date information, useful links and videos and good lecturers in general. Thank you for the insights and knowledge.",4
107017,"An informative course on the social and financial implications due to Zika as well as the factors leading to an epidemic of Zika virus,,",4
